        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Robert Greene. Robert Greene is an author who has written more than five best selling books, including the 48 Laws of power, the Laws of human nature, and mastery. He did his bachelor's training at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Robert Greene's books are both unique and important for several reasons, not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self, self exploration and the psychology of human interaction, all rooted in history and modern culture, and at the same time, in a way that pertains to everybody. I first learned about Robert's work from reading the book mastery, which to my mind is a brilliant exploration and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose. Whenever I'm asked for book suggestions, I always include mastery in my top three recommendations. During today's discussion, we cover a wide range of topics, including how to find and pursue and achieve one's purpose. We talk about the selection of a life partner, as well as romantic and other types of relationships. We also discuss the topics of motivation and urgency and this concept of death ground which arose during our discussion of Robert's recent stroke. Robert's stroke rendered him certain limitations, but also has allowed him to explore how to write, how to exercise, indeed how to interface with life in general in new ways that allow him to continue to expand his sense of purpose. I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you will have gleaned tremendous amounts of new knowledge that will allow you to navigate forward along the path to your purpose, perhaps find your purpose if you feel you haven't done that yet, as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself, with others, and indeed to the world around you. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com Huberman Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens, and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep breast, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session if you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with Robert Greene. Robert, I'm so happy you're here."

But there was a final lecture where I would do a lot of q and A with the students about science, about careers, about career paths. And what I found was that many of the students had questions about not just science, but about how to learn and forage for information. And I recommended three books at the end of the course. Every year that I taught it. I taught it for four years. And one of the books was the book longitude, which is a wonderful story about discovery of time keeping devices at sea. One book I'll leave as a mystery, not to be mysterious, but because it's a science book, I'll just tell you what it is. It's principles of neuroscience."

And the reason I recommended mastery is because these students were soon going to go into the great jungle of post undergraduate education. For me, I found mastery to be an absolutely transformative book in that it taught me so much about how to learn from others, how to expect certain types of interactions when one assigns themselves to a mentor, and vice versa. And it talked about some things that we'll get into in more depth today, but not the least of which is about identifying that unique seed that exists within all of us that can guide our best decisions in terms of finding our purpose. And so I usually end with a great debt of gratitude, and I'll probably do that again at the end, but I want to start with a great debt of gratitude."

So I tell you that, and I also will use that as a segue for asking you now, since I'm sure people's ears are pricked up to this, how do you find your purpose? Could you share with us what it is to find one's purpose? And how early life events perhaps can cue us to what that purpose is for each of us?"

        "text": "Well, thank you for that marvelous introduction. I'm almost blushing. That's fantastic story. Well, being a human being is not easy, as opposed to an animal, because we're born and nobody gives us a direction. Our parents might be a little bit, our college teachers, etcetera, mentors, but generally we're on our own. And it's a very, very difficult process. You wake up in the morning and you don't really know what you're, what you can do. You could choose twelve different paths. It can be very confusing and very overwhelming when you find that sense of purpose, when you find what I call your life's task. Everything has a direction, everything has a purpose. Your energy is concentrated. It's not like you're just going down a single narrow pathway. It's not like life becomes boring and it's just about discipline and solving problems. It's actually the most exciting thing that can ever happen to you, because you never have that lost feeling. You wake up in the morning and you go, yeah, this is what I need to accomplish. People come at you, you, with all kinds of distractions and boring and irritating things. You're able to cut it out. It's just the most marvelous piece of internal radar that you can have. So I genuinely wish that everybody can find that kind of internal radar. And so it's not easy. And I understand that there's no, like instant formula, because we're all about instant formulas. It's difficult, and I want you to know that. So it's not like Robert can give me the answer in three minutes. No, I can't. But there's a process involved. It's not a mystery. You can follow a very singular process. And the idea is you're talking about childhood. The way I like to frame it is when you were born. You are a phenomenon. You are unique. Your DNA has never occurred in the history of the universe going back billions of years. It will never occur in the future. Your life experience with your parents and everything that you experience in your early years going on up is unique. It's yours. You're one of a kind, right? So that is your source of power to waste. That is just the worst thing you can do in your life. And what the power is. Is finding that uniqueness what makes you you and how you can mine that and how you can go deep into it and use that to create a career path. Right? And so I tell people, when you're a child, when you're four or five or even younger, you have what the great psychologist Maslow called impulse voices. They're little voices in your head that say, I love this. I hate that. I like this food. I don't like when mommy moves this way. I like when daddy comes from here. You're very cued into who you are and what you like and what you don't like. And these voices kind of direct you in certain ways. Right? And when you're very young, they direct you towards intellectual mental pursuits as well. And there's a book I recommend for everybody. It's Howard Gardner's five frames of mind. It's helped me immensely. The idea is he talks about five forms of intelligence. Our problem is we think of intelligence as mostly intellectual, but there are many forms of intelligence. There's the intelligence that has to do with words. There's abstract intelligence that has to do with patterns and mathematics. There's kinetic intelligence that has to do with the body. There's social intelligence. He has five of them. And the idea is your brain naturally veers towards one of them. It can veer towards two of them. That happens. But generally, one of them kind of dominates, right? And it's like a grain in your brain that's going in a certain direction. You want to go with that grain because that's where your power will lie. So when you're young, if you go back and think about when you were four or five, you can maybe get a picture of some kind of direction or voice inside of you that was impelling you towards this. I know for me it was words. I can remember when I was six years old, I was just obsessed with words. Just the letters in words, almost, like in almost slightly schizophrenic way. I would spell words backwards. I would take them apart. I would do anagrams. I love palindromes. Right? So I had a thing about words and language. It's very primal. Some people. You know, Albert Einstein, when he was four years old, his father gave him a birthday gift of a compass. And he was just mesmerized by this compass, the idea that there are invisible forces out there in the cosmos moving this needle, and he's obsessed with the idea of invisible forces. Steve Jobs, when he was, like, seven or eight or maybe younger, in Burlingame, California, his father, they passed by a store with technological devices in the window, and he was just hypnotized by the design of those devices and the glass tubes and everything. So he wanted to go in that direction. Tiger woods saw his father hitting golf balls in the garage, and he was just, like, screaming with joy. He had to do that. Right. You know, I can give you a million different examples of this. Of course, these are people who are famous. Obviously, we can go back and find that it's easier. But what happens to you, and please cut me off if I'm going on too long."

        "text": "What happens to you is you're seven now, you're getting older, and you're starting to not hear that voice anymore. You're hearing the voice of your teachers telling you you're not good at this field. You need to get better at mathematic. You know, you shouldn't be interested in these sports or anything. You should be going this direction. Your parents are starting to tell you this is the career they want for you or the direction they want you to go in, right? You start hearing that more than your own voice. And as you get older, it gets worse and worse and worse. Then when you're a teenager, it's all about what other people are doing, your peers, what's cool, what's not cool. And that kind of is more. So all of these noise enters your brain, and you can't hear that anymore. You don't know who you are. And so you go to college. You kind of maybe choose a major that seems practical, that your parents want you to go into. Maybe you kind of wander around. You're not sure. And then you enter the work world without that inner radar that I'm talking about. And, brother, you're lost, right? Where should I go? Well, I need to make money, right? And so you make a choice based on the need to make a lot of money. Not everyone, but some people do that, and I understand that need. We all need to make a living. But that can set you off in a very bad path because you're not connected emotionally. The thing is, when you figure out that primal inclination, that grain that's inside of you, then you have the energy to be disciplined, to go through boring tasks, to learn. You learn at a faster rate because you're emotionally engaged. When you're emotionally engaged in a subject, the brain learns twice, three times, four times as fast as when you're not. I always give the example. In college, I studied foreign languages, which was kind of a passion of mine, for three or four years I studied French and then I went to Paris and I couldn't speak a word. It was useless because it didn't teach me anything practical, right? I was totally confused. And then. But I was in Paris and I loved it and I wanted to live there, right? And I had a girlfriend and I needed to speak French to her. And I can tell you, in one month I learned more than those four years of university because I wanted to, because I was engaged. My emotions were there. It was like I had to survive to learn French. Whereas so most of us, we don't have a need really to learn this subject. We're paying half attention. But when you find that thing that really connects to you, you're paying deep attention, your emotions are engaged, you're learning at a much faster rate. Okay? And so the thing is, how do you find that when you're older, when you're 21? I give people a lot of help and it's usually not so difficult. We can go through that process. It gets harder when you're 30 and you've been wandering around, but it's not impossible. I didn't really start find my exact path until I was 38, 39, to be honest. So there's hope when you get 40 and you get 50, it gets more and more difficult. Right? And it's very sad if you wasted that seed of uniqueness that I'm talking about. And I tell people there are ways of going back. And we go through a process like archaeology. We have to dig and dig and dig and find those bones from your childhood that indicated what you were meant to do. But when you find your life's task, everything opens up. It doesn't mean you figured out, okay, I've got to aim for this particular job when I'm 28. That's not how it works. It gives you a sense of direction. You can try different things, you can experiment, you can have fun. When you're in your twenties, you're going to learn. You're going to learn skills, but it gives you an overall framework instead of, whoa, all of this confusion, this chaos, social media, the Internet, I could go here, here, here you're lost at sea. It gives you a very important sense."

But the way I imagine this process is that as a human, we're plopped into an environment. And here I'm using analogy, wherever we don't really know if we are an aquatic animal, a terrestrial animal, or an avian. Right. Or an amphibian, or an amphibian, for that matter, and to make the wrong choice to be an amphibian who's trying to fly, although I'm sure they're out there in the animal kingdom, it's not just a waste of time. It's probably deadly. And not to over dramatize the failure of finding one's purpose. I see it that way. Whereas perhaps we could just say that the process of finding one's purpose is to realize, like, ah, you know, I'm an amphibian. I can go in and out of water, whereas a bunch of other creatures around me stop at the water's edge. Right, right. And this is really cool. And a bunch of these other things, like these flying things, that they can't actually even go in the water."

        "text": "Yeah. Without making it too specific to my unique tastes. As a kid, I loved flora and fauna. I love learning about biology. Yeah, no surprise there. But animals and how they move in particular, and fish and going to a proper aquarium store for the first time, for me, and going snorkeling for the first time was like, wow. And even as I describe it, it's almost like my body floats. I feel it in my left arm, of all things, and it feels like there's something to do about it. It's not just that I'm in observation of things that delight me. It's like there's an activation state created within me. Like, I got to do something with this. And typically it's tell everybody about it until they won't listen anymore. But oftentimes, it's to also draw those things, to think about them, and I just delight in them. It's a constant source of delight. And so seeds such as those, and there are a few other things in that landscape of flora and fauna, and learning about animals and biology, including the human animal, and then organizing information, feels so satisfying to me. It's like a drug that. And so it just felt. Feels like this eternal spring of life. Right. And so for me, that's what it was. And in 2015, when I was teaching that course, the course I loved, but I was feeling a little bit astray in my scientific career. And then I read mastery, and I realized, yes, I love running a laboratory. I love teaching. But there's something else for me, and it has to do not with a podcast. I didn't even know what a podcast. I probably. I knew what a podcast was. I was listening to podcasts at that time, but. But I wasn't on social media. I had no thoughts of having a podcast. But what I wanted was that feeling in its total number of forms. That's the goal. Get that feeling in as many forms as possible."

It's visceral, it's emotional, it's physical, and you feel it in your body. And when you're doing it, it's like it's at your level, it's like you're swimming with the current. You feel it. Things are easy. Everything clicks together. There's a delight. Not everything is going to be delightful. There's going to be tedium involved. There's going to be moments of boredom, but you're able to withstand the moments of boredom because you feel that deep overall connection. So, yes, that's precisely what I'm talking about. I mean, it's. For me, it's a little bit similar. Thing is I said about words, but the other thing that I was obsessed with when I was a kid was early human ancestors. Don't ask me why. I just was so obsessed with our ancestors millions of years ago and how it's possible to be living here in the sixties or seventies with cars and everything, but to come to where we are now. And I wrote a short story when I was eight years old about a vulture. It was written from the point of view of a vulture watching the first humans kind of emerge on the planet. I'm sure it was absolutely awful, dreadful. But the weird thing is, I'm writing a new book, and all I'm doing in that book is going into early humans. And I feel like a kid again. I'm so excited. I'm so happy. So I can very much relate to your story."

        "text": "You mentioned these five different forms of intelligence, or frames of mind, as you refer to them, and I'm certainly aware that I lean towards a more intellectual interest. Although, as you pointed out, the excitement, the delight is visceral, and the actions are actions. They're over the body. Ultimately, one has to draw, speak, write books, et cetera, to transmute that excitement into something real for people that are not as intellectually tuned, but maybe are kinesthetically tuned, for instance. I can only wonder what that's like. I'm not completely uncoordinated, but I don't think I have a kinesthetic, attunement, or frame of mind. But I, for instance, had a podcast listener mention that they think in feels that they literally experience thought as sort of a patchwork of bodily sensations. And that thought for them is not of the stuff from the neck up, but only from the neck down, which to me, was really intriguing. And so I only raised this because there have to be, as you point out, there's an infinite number of different sort of orientations based on our unique DNA and experience. But what do you think explains why these particular seeds, or, as you point out, the direction that the grain runs in the brain? I mean, it's partially gonna be nature. It's gonna be DNA for sure. But we're talking about this as if there's some exciting or awe inspiring or delightful thing that captures us. Can it be the other way, too? Can it be one has a bad experience as a child in an intellectual environment, and then decides, I'm going in. The things of the body feel good, things of the mind, of intellect feels bad? And does it matter whether or not we are drawn to our purpose by recognizing what we love or what we hate or are both useful?"

        "text": "Oh, they're both very, very useful. You know, a lot of intelligence is nonverbal. We think in terms of images. We're very much infected by the emotions of other people. So I know, for instance, my mother is very, very interested in history. She's obsessed with history, and I probably absorbed her interest in history. I don't think there's a genetic gene for that interest. So you're going to absorb things from your parents as well. So it's not all just genetic. But, yeah, what you hate will have a big thing. But the problem with doing that is if you go into a direction and you're in elementary school, etcetera, and they force you to learn math and you hate it, what it tends to do is it turns you off from learning in general. You think, I don't want to be disciplined. I don't want to go through anything because it's painful. It doesn't lead anywhere. It's not me. It's frustration. It turns you off from learning in general. So it's really really important for a child to have the love experience as early as possible so that they can know what they hate and why they hate it, right. And then they can rebel and they can go into that field as opposed to I hate learning, I hate discipline, I hate studying, I hate trying things over and over again. If you're kinesthetically oriented. And, you know, a part of me, I understand that because I love sports, is you have to, you have to practice. It's going to take a lot of. It's not. You're not going to instantly be good at something, right. And that's going to require a love of it. Right. But if your mathematic experience, because I hate learning, shit, it's going to transfer to sports. You're going to hate discipline in general. So it's very important for parents to let that child have at least glimmers of that love moment. I know for me, when I finished college and I entered the work world, I had to get a job. I worked in journalism. I hated it. I hated working for other people. I hated office politics. I hated all the egos. I hated the smarminess. I hated the lack of quality. It was all just about, you know, making money and getting things out there. And then I worked in Hollywood. I hated Hollywood. I hated working in Hollywood. That formed me very much, maybe go in the direction that I went in, but only from the basis of I knew that I wanted to be a writer. So, you know, that's very important that it's not just hate. It can form you, but there also has to be that positive, deep emotional love of something that also is grounded in you in some way."

And earlier when you were talking about how we are so much more engaged and driven towards things that stir us emotionally, and actually, we know, based on the neuroscience, as you know, too, I'm sure that only by the release of certain neurochemicals in the brain and body would our brain have any reason to change. Right. If you don't feel agitation and you can do everything that you're trying to do, of course your brain wouldn't change. Like, why would it? That agitation is a signature of the neurochemicals that are saying, hey, something's different now."

And normally we hear about the concept of energy in the context of caloric energy, like what should we eat and when and how much, and we need to get sleep. But what you're really referring to is neural energy, like the engagement of ourselves that's, you know, sitting there ready to be engaged. But it requires the right experiential macronutrients. Right, the experiential micronutrients, as opposed to, of course, we need good nutrition, but that's nothing sufficient. It's necessary, but not sufficient. So would you say that when we are, let's say, since a good number of our listeners are in adulthood, from our twenties on, that the things that excite us as adults that really generate some feeling of readiness or grab our attention, are still informative toward guiding our decisions about best life and life purpose?"

I mean, like, because there are things that excite you in a kind of a quick way, like, you know, where you have to relieve some tension and there's entertainment and there's things that kind of give you pretty immediate gratification. And there's the larger picture of something that will give you fulfillment over years to come. So you can feel that when you're older and you can pay attention to it. But a lot of the time is we're paying too much attention to the immediate pleasures of life, to what gives us instant gratification, and that's what we're grabbing for. So this is a much more kind of deeper process that involves that digging that I was saying, it's deeper than just kind of, I like this, I don't like that kind of thing. It's more something macro than just that. When you're in your twenties or in your thirties or your forties, you want to be paying attention to yourself. And the problem with people in the world today is you're not paying attention to yourself. You're not inside your own head. You don't hear those voices. You don't hear what you love, what you like anymore, because, as I said, there's so many of these other distractions going on. And so you're always, like, attuned to what other people like, right? Because you're in social media. This is what people are following. This is what they're interested in as opposed to disengaging, backing off from that and looking at yourself and going through the process of. That's not me, actually. I don't really like that. And so what you're talking about is, I think, very profound, is levels of frustration or anxiety are definite signals that you must pay attention to, that they're telling you this isn't a good direction for you, this is a waste of time for you. And in general, I tell people self awareness, being able to hear those voices, to understand that your frustration is telling you something. And sometimes you just act on it without understanding it. But understanding why you're frustrated, why you don't like your career, why you're not happy about where you're going, is the key to everything. It will open up. It will actually be able, even in your thirties, to return you to that childhood inclination. But if you can't listen to where those emotions come from, then they're useless. They're not teaching you anything."

Athletic greens, now called ag one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greenshouse once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are methadone and it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D, three, k, two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com Huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D, three k, two. So it sounds like one of the goals is to engage in what I'll just call for the moment, unadulterated, self referencing, unadulterated in all senses of the word, because as a child, as you pointed out, at stages of life that are before puberty, they're literally pre sexual, which I think is important because puberty to me, as a neurobiologist who started off as a developmental neurobiologist, I can tell you that puberty is the most profound transformation that the brain undergoes in the entire lifespan. There's just absolutely no question about it. Everything is different after puberty because of all of the new relational dynamics that become apparent and our potential involvement in them. It's just, you know, it's not talked about enough. How dramatically puberty changes the brain."

And not just through the lens of sexuality, but also expectation of what we are capable of, what we are responsible for, or not responsible for our learning capacity. I mean, puberty is like this. It's also the most rapid stage of aging in our entire lifespan. Those kids that go home for summer and then come back, like, shaving, I was sort of a late. I wasn't a late bloomer, but I had a long, protracted puberty. But I remember those kids. I'm sure we all remember those kids. Everything changes. And so I think prior to puberty, these seeds, as you've described them, of delight or of resistance to things, they are unadulterated. They're not contaminated by the voices and expectations of others. And so I can see the challenge of reaching back to those as an adult. I wonder if this relates to something that I've heard you talk about before, although perhaps not as much as some of the other topics you've discussed publicly, which is the real versus the false sublime. Could you perhaps just define for us what sublime really is, what a sublime experience is, and the distinction between real and false sublime experiences? Because I feel like this relates to finding that seed. Right. It's about finding authentic seeds of within us, as opposed to when emotions can be distracting and misleading."

        "text": "Wow. I never thought I'd never made that connection. It's the book that I'm writing right now, so thank you for that. I have to think about that. I'm actually. I'm writing a book on the sublime. And I have several ways of kind of illustrating. I generally like to use a metaphor, and the metaphor is that being a human being, being a social human being, living in a particular culture means that you live inside of a circle. And that circle of that time are the conventions of thinking, of ideas that are acceptable, of behavior that is acceptable. This is where you can go mentally, where you can go physically, all the codes and conventions. So that circle for ancient Egypt and for 21st century America, they're obviously very different. But it's the same circle. It's the same limiting factor. You're not supposed to go outside of it. These are thoughts, experiences, behavior you're not supposed to do. The sublime is what lies just outside that circle. The word sublime comes from on the threshold of. It's like, here's a door. And the sublime is literally at the threshold of the door. You're looking out into something else, right? And the quintessential sublime experience is a near death experience. You're standing on the doorway, the threshold of death itself. Right? And so in my book, I'm illustrating the different kinds of sublime experiences that you can have in relation to the cosmos, in the relation to thinking about being alive. Just being alive is the strangest sensation you could possibly have. I know that very personally. After my stroke, I go into childhood, chapter on childhood and how sublime your own childhood was. I go into animals. The relation to animals. I go. I have a chapter about the brain, a chapter about love. I'm working right now on a chapter about history. Okay? But what I'm trying to say is the human brain is wired for these experiences, is wired for transcendental experiences that take us out of the narrow little realm that we live in because we're aware of our death as the only animal truly conscious of its own mortality. And it frightens the hell out of us. And the idea that we can see something larger than just the banal parts of our life is a doorway that allows us to kind of transcend the moment, to feel connected to something larger, to feel connected to some power in the cosmos, to evolution itself. Right? And so we're wired for that. And I'm writing a chapter now about 40,000 years ago, at the moment where I think the sublime was born is a story that I'm trying to illustrate right now with our upper paleolithic ancestors. So it's deep inside of us. We need it. We have to have it in the 21st century. We have very few avenues for it, any real avenues. Religion used to be the main kind of way of accessing this. And so because it's so deep, we reach for false forms of the sublime that give us the sense that we're transcending. But it's not at all, because sublime has to come from within. It's an experience that you have, that you're generating in your own mind, in your own experience. The false sublime comes from outside. It comes from drugs. It comes from alcohol, it comes from shopping. It comes from online rage. It comes from joining a cause and just getting out all your aggression and violence, right? It comes from causes. It comes from addictions, okay? It gives you a sense. It calms you down and makes you feel like there's something else going on in life besides your job that you're sick of. But it's not real. It's not lasting. It's false. It's an illusion. It's not based on anything real. It's not connecting to that deep part of human nature that's wired for these experiences. So what happens is you have to have more and more and more and more of it. You have to have, you know, more of this rush. You need more of the drug, you need more of the alcohol, you need more of the sex, you need more of the porn. It's never going to satisfy you. But the real sublime, you don't have that feeling. It's like it's transformative. Once you feel it, it lasts for you for the rest of your life. It's what Maslow, again, called the peak experience. So that's the difference between the false and the real sublime. I haven't quite connected it to what you were saying, but if I think about it, I think you're on something very interesting."

Like, I'm an amphibian. This is my environment, and you're an amphibian, too, and we're different amphibians, but we're going to be amphibians together. And there's a permanence to it that does seem to transcend time. I'm obsessed with time perception, so I have to be careful not to go off on a tangent about that, but the human brain's ability to fine slice or macro slice time, it's incredible. And it's been said of not just addictions, but also interactions with toxic people that they murder time that humans have. I think it was Jung. I'll look it up. But one of the great psychologists said something to the extent that addictive behaviors, thought patterns, substances are humans attempts to murder time so that they don't have to address their mortality.

        "text": "Fantastic. I can't wait. I can't wait. I'd like to shift slightly to a topic that you've written extensively about, which is power and not just power, but also seduction, which you've written extensively about. And of course, you've written about finding one's purpose. So tell me if the framework that I've just given myself liberty to create is an accurate one. And if it's not, I'm hoping that it's not in perhaps some interesting ways. So to me, you talk about, and we will talk about power as a resource. It's something that it's there as a resource. It could be used or not used. And I think of seduction as one form of exchange between an individual. So there's a verb associated with seduction, power. I'm thinking of more as a noun. In this context, you're the word guy. And then purpose is really about finding to what end or ends one is going to devote. Power, seduction, and the other forces that allow human beings to interact with each other in the world. But power as a resource that can be expressed in different ways and accessed in different ways. Maybe we could just explore that a little bit. Because when we hear the word power, I think a lot of people brace themselves, like, here we go, someone's going to try and have power over me. This is about manipulation and so on and so forth. But I learned pretty early on that every, every career endeavor, there are power dynamics. There's mentor mentee, they're teachers and they're students, and both have power. In romantic relationships, there's a power exchange. There are yeses and there are nos. There are maybes. There are covert and overt contracts. I'll do this because I want to. You'll do this because you want to? Great. Sounds great. Overt contract. There are also covert contracts. Well, I don't feel safe doing that. So what I'll do is I'll take something from the interaction that you're not aware of so that I can sort of ease my sense of danger and give myself the illusion of feeling safe. And all sorts of kind of complicated human dynamics that have to do with us having this forebrain thing that can do all of that gymnastics. So maybe we could start very simply by just saying, how would you define power in terms of its functional definition, like in interpersonal relations? And then why do you think power is so essential to all relationships? That's really what I'd like to get to. Why is it so essential? Why couldn't it be something else?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, the way I define power is I try and take it away from that kind of negative context that most people have and that you brought up, and I bring it to something very primitive. And very primal, the way the human being is wired, the feeling that we have no control over our environment. And in the earliest period, it was literally over our environment and wild animals and nature and the climate, etcetera. But now the sense that you have no control over your career, over your children, over your parents, is deeply, deeply immiserating. And it compels us to act in certain ways, either attempts to find positive ways of power or doing what you call covert ways of getting power. You know, passive aggressive. Traditionally passive aggressive means. So it's deeply wired in us to want a degree of control over the immediate environment and immediate events. We can never have complete control. And the idea of having complete control is nonsense. And it would actually be very ugly because you want a degree of letting go and letting circumstances come to you, etcetera, etcetera. So the sense of you want to feel like with other people and relationships, that you can influence them, that you can move them in a certain direction, either to get you to love you and treat you better, or either to stop annoying, irritating behaviors, or either to, you know, wake up and find and do productive activity. If it's your children, etcetera. You want to have the ability to influence people, to move them in a certain direction, either in your interest or in their interest, right? And once you have that need, and every single human being ever who's ever lived has that need, and we often don't recognize it because we're embarrassed by it. We're embarrassed by our desire for power, for our need to control. Every human being has it, right? And it's not easy, because human beings are complicated. They don't. If you say, do this and you're talking to your son, he'll do the opposite or he'll do something else. You can't just force people in a direction, right, by being overt and telling them, this is what you need to do. You create resentment, you create an enemy. They may say, yes, yes, daddy, yes, husband, I'll do what you say, but they're going to resist you deep down inside, right? So people are tricky. They wear masks. They pretend to say one thing and they do another. They have their egos, and you inadvertently wound their egos or trip them in some way, and they react in a way that you don't expect. And so power is this kind of invisible realm that envelops society, where people are continually battling each other and struggling in it, but no one is, like, talking about it, no one's being overt about it. No one's saying, this is exactly what I'm trying to do. And so when you enter the social world and the career world, you're not expecting these battles. No one's taught you, no one's trained you. Your parents don't train you, nobody trains you. And you make mistakes and you realize how political people are. If you're a sharky character and there's a certain percentage of them, you realize, wow, I can deceive people, I can manipulate them, I can get what I want, I can pretend to love them and they'll fall for me, and I can do all this other stuff. But for most of us, the 95% of us who aren't sharks, and I'm including myself in that category, it's very, very disturbing to suddenly enter that world and see all of that invisible power games on that no one's given you any advice for, helped you. And so take it out of the realm of, it's just about trying to dominate the world and manipulate and exploit and abuse. It's something inside of you. You have this need, and your suppression of it will only make you come out in passive ways and you won't be able to control certain things. If you want to move people, if you want them to follow your ideas, if you want them to be more aligned with your politics or your ideas, you have to be subtle. You have to learn psychology, you have to learn certain aspects of how to almost move people without them realizing in certain directions, which is like the art of seduction. And if you're not interested in that, if you're just going to tell people what you think and what you're going to do, that means you're not interested in practical action, you're not interested in results. You're just interested in inventing your own frustrations or your own anger. So learning the subtle little dynamics of power is extremely essential because we're a social animal. It doesn't mean that you're going to get dirty, that you're going to suddenly go out there and manipulate the hell out of people. Most of the 48 laws of power is about defense. But how to defend yourself from the sharks about there, how to defend yourself from making classic mistakes, like outshining the master, like talking too much, like arguing with people instead of demonstrating your ideas on and on and on. It's not an ugly thing. It actually makes you a better social individual. So that's how I like to frame it."

I think as a young guy growing up, it was so important to me to know where I fit in with my friend group, and I didn't think of it so much as a hierarchy, nor when I was in my academic studies, did I think of it as a hierarchy, even though it was clearly was so much as the goal was to figure out where was my unique slot, that I could do the most good for myself and others, kind of finding my spot. I don't want to say on a shelf, because that gives an image of something vertical, but let's make it lateral, a lateral arrangement of different people with different strengths, different life purposes, trying to figure them out, where should I be in order to express that and also feel connected to others? And in order to do that, I did have to, I realize now, based on your answer, I did have to figure out who's trying to have power over who's pretending that they don't want power, but is actually exerting power, these sorts of things. And there's an incredible peace that comes from knowing that one is in their correct place, both profession, interpersonally, in relation to oneself, but also in the context of one's peer, peer group. This is where I belong, because trying to gain power, when one is trying to move to a position that isn't right for them, or in a way that isn't right for them, just seems so energetically costly, seems like a waste of a life, frankly. Trying to gather resources simply to have them, to give the illusion of power, but then being afraid of losing them just sounds like a recipe for misery. As you pointed out, figuring out where am I most powerful, in the benevolent sense of the word, that seems like a good pursuit."

You know, I knew when I was young that I couldn't exert physical power because I was a skinny little runt and I wasn't bullied, but people would kind of pick on me, et cetera, et cetera. So I veered towards intellectual pursuits where I could have power. And in the end, you might have been a jock and you might have done well in high school, but, haha, look at me now. I'm not saying that it's a beautiful thing, but that's part of human nature, the desire to actually prove yourself and find that niche that you belong to so you don't have that kind of sense of inferiority, which Alfred Adler, the psychologist, describes very eloquently. So a lot of it is kind of compensating when you're a child for things that are your weaknesses, and finding what you're so good at that. You do have that power, and people can't bully you, right? And you're like, now a famous neuroscientist, whereas they're like, who knows what they're doing kind of thing. So power definitely is connected in some way to that inner sense of what you were meant to do, and you feel it with the ease and the connection that comes from it. Right.

I suppose we could seduce ourselves through denial or convincing ourselves of something. But more often than not, when we talk about seduction, we're talking about an interaction between two or more people. So what are some of the core principles of seduction? And if you care to play anthropologist a bit, and neuroscientists, I would invite that. Why do you think we have neural circuits in our brain that allow us to seduce and be seduced?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I don't know how if I'm being kind of an armchair intellectual here, but my theory is some of it has to go back to social events long in our prehistory, which have to do with taboos. And society was initially kind of organized by a series of taboos, right? Most notably the taboo on incest. And what happened? This is just not my theory. It's the theory of the Malinowski. Malinowski is how to pronounce it the moment a taboo enters the human brain. Like you're not supposed to sleep with this woman. The desire arises inside of you to actually sleep with that woman. The sense of no sense that this is prohibited stirs the desire, stirs the contrary impulses in humans. And we can be very, what's the word? Perverse creatures. Right? So if you've ever tried to suppress a thought, you realize that it keeps coming up. It keeps coming up. You can't suppress it. Don't think of an elephant, Andrews. Whatever you do, don't think of an elephant. You're thinking of it because you can't help it. Right? The idea that you're not supposed to desire this person stirs that actual desiree. So I believe the sense of something being taboo and transgressive is the ultimate kind of origin of our desire for seduction. But seduction involves vulnerability. It involves somebody gets inside, somebody gets under our skin, right? And to do that, we have to let them in. So the person being seduced is in some ways, to a degree, complicit. Because if you just put up a wall and you said, no, I'm not going to be seduced, nothing will happen. But you have a vulnerability. You're letting that person into your psyche, into your inner space. The paradigm for that is early childhood. So Freud talks a lot about this. I don't know if people still believe in Freud anymore."

But his idea was that the child is seduced by the parent. You're in an extremely vulnerable position, right? Your life depends on them, and they're seducing you with their energy. You're letting them in, right? And that kind of creates a pattern for the rest of your life. And so, for instance, the feeling of being carried by your father and just being taken around physically is a form of seduction because you don't know what he's going to do to you. You're very excited. You want that surprise, right? And to me, it's related to the seduction of a story. Stories are very seducing to us. We don't know where they're taking us. We don't know what the next chapter is, what's going to happen to this character or not. The surprise lowers our resistance and opens our mind up to what's going to happen next is a form of seduction. Fairy tales, the stories you were reading as a child, your interactions with your parents, they're deeply, deeply ingrained in you. You cannot be seduced unless you are vulnerable. Right? And so I like to switch it around and get out of the negative connotations. Being vulnerable is actually a positive trait. I think a lot of people now in the world today, because things are so harsh and invasive that people have become too invulnerable. They don't want to let anything in, right? And this now infects their relationships with other people. They don't want to be influenced. They want to be strong inside of themselves. They're afraid of giving in to the other person, of surrendering to their influence. But it's actually a delightful feeling to surrender to the power of another person, then reverse that charge and have them surrender to your power. So when I'm reading a writer, and sometimes they completely seduce me, like Friedrich Nietzsche is one of my favorite writers, I let go of everything. I let him enter my brain, and I'm completely seduced. I let him lead me along. But then I encounter writers that I don't like at all. I'll mention one, you know, probably not a good thing, but Steven Pinker. I don't like Steven Pinker. I find him really annoying. Okay? But I force myself to try and find a way to be seduced by him, to let him into my brain, to see where he's coming from, to open myself to the possibility that he could be correct. So vulnerability, letting people into your mental space, is a form of intelligence. It's kind of an emotional and an intellectual intelligence."

You're not going to be hijacked to the point of no return or in some way that's detrimental to you. That's right. I'm sounding really nerdy here. It's collinear with confidence in many ways. Sure.

I mean, you see court cases about this that are public, and you just go, why didn't they just walk away from one another? Well, because once those attachment systems are locked in, it almost becomes in here, metaphorically speaking, like a parent child relationship. Like, you can't suddenly decide your parents weren't your parents simply because you know better. Now you are forever stricken with the reality that they were and they had an influence.

And so the idea is that men want to let go because men have to be so in control, so powerful. They have to project this image. They have a secret desire to let go and be almost dominated by a very powerful woman. A lot of men have that. And I talk about some of the most powerful men in history. Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Joe DiMaggio, all these men, very masculine men who've fallen for very feminine, siren like women and been completely dominated by them. And they actually kind of enjoy the process because it's like a sense of I can let go. I can enter this totally sensual, physical world, and it's extremely pleasing. It's like another realm outside of my kind of cold, masculine world, you know? So I don't really get men complaining too much about women who've seduced them.

If one is giving someone else the impression that they are more powerful by virtue of the word giving, they actually hold some power. Power can be given or taken. Oftentimes, seductive exchanges and sexual exchanges and romantic exchanges in particular are about both people buying into a temporary illusion. Let's pretend that you're in charge when actually I'm in charge, okay? But I know that you think that you're in charge. Okay, let's just pretend none of that exists and just do xdev right? And I think this is another example of COVID contracts, and it's one that actually can potentially create a lot of problems post hoc. Right.

It was invented by women who had no power, essentially, socially, politically, in any sense of the word, domestically. Right. But the one power that they could wield over a man was through sex, some physical attraction. And so they developed this art of kind of luring a man into their world through various theatrical effects. Cleopatra being kind of the archetype of this, and then luring the powerful man into this world. He has the illusion that he's the one pursuing her, but in fact, she is the one controlling the dynamic. So oftentimes, the person who appears to be the weaker one in the relationship, who's not doing the pursuing, is actually inviting the pursuing, is actually leading the other person on. So there's a lot of kind of appearance games going on, and you can never really figure out who exactly is in control of the dynamic because one person is like, allowing the other person to lead them on, but the fact that you're allowing them is a degree of power, is a degree of control. Right. So it's very hard to figure out. And sex and power and romantic relationships are very much intertwined in us, physically, emotionally, neurologically. You can't avoid it. Right. And so I think it's kind of dishonest to say that none of that exists, that it's like, that there's some egalitarian paradise out of there when it's really not wired in us for that kind of relationship."

        "text": "There's a recent scientific publication, factoid that I wanted to share with you in this context, because I'd like your thoughts on it. David Anderson, who's a phenomenal neurobiologist, he's been a guest on this podcast before. He's a professor at Caltech, studies basically the functions of the hypothalamus. So things like aggression, mating, and things of that sort, and does it so in great detail. He's a virtuoso of the hypothalamus, and he published a paper two years ago showing that indeed, there are neural circuits in the brain of animals, and presumably in humans as well, that control sexual mounting behavior, but that there is actually a separate circuit for purely non sexual mounting and physical power over that's expressed in animals and anyone that's ever owned a dog and gone to the dog park will see same sex mounting between dogs or mounting between dogs. That has apparently no sexual endpoint. And in exploring this literature and some talking to David about it, it's very clear that there are neural circuits that have everything to do with essentially one animal of a species getting on top of the other animal, usually from behind, oftentimes scruffing or biting the back of the neck and saying, I control you. It's often done in a playful context, especially between animals. Not always aggressive, but there's a certain element of aggressive to it. But it essentially says, I decide whether or not you are mobile or not for this moment. And this is very important. I want to emphasize this. This is a circuit that is entirely separate from all of the reflexes associated with sexual behavior in males and females. I find this to be fascinating because we hear about power over and we hear about power and we think about physical power over. But the idea that something as primitive as mounting, just like something as primitive as biting or as striking, has its own unique set of circuits in the brain, I think substantiates everything that you put in your books about power and maybe even seduction as well. So as I just kind of toss that out there for consideration, I wonder if you have any reflections on it. If not, feel free to just say, I don't. But of course. But to me, this was a really important discovery because I think everyone looks at mounting behavior and says, oh, that has to be sexual. And sometimes it's."

        "text": "And kind of like the antithesis of my art of seduction, where I'm almost contradicting myself. And I was going into the biology of it and even into the physics of it. So there's a famous french biologist whose name escapes me, sorry, I can't remember, from the twenties and thirties. And he was studying paramecium and he found he was studying them, you know, they're in these ponds, etcetera. And he said that there was these moments where these single celled organisms were suddenly coupling. They were all joining together, just one to one, and they were absorbing the membrane of one inside the other. And then they would, like, go. And then once one couple did that, all the paramecium started joining up together. Then they would sink to the bottom of the pond. And paramecium don't reproduce through sex. They reproduce through dividing themselves. Right? Self reproduction. And so he was saying that the desire to couple, to connect to someone so deeply, where you absorb one, is absorbed in the other, is biologically wired into us, goes back millions and millions and millions of years. And it's a desire, essentially, a biological desire for love, right? And it's an energy that permeates all. It's not just about power and hierarchies and that he was showing other creatures that had something similar going on. And in physics, we talk about entanglement, and we also talk about matter. If matter isn't opposed by a lot of kinetic energy, it joins together. I mean, particles join together to form matter, et cetera, et cetera. So there's something in the universe that's trying to connect things to each other. So there's this kind of energy that exists in the world where we have a deep need to connect to somebody outside of those power dynamics, right? Where there's a degree of equality, where we're drawn to each other, and we let go of the ego games, we let go of the playing. We kind of surmount our own physiology, our own hypothalamus, and we engage in this. I call it love sublime. And it involves the physical part, the sexual part is the trigger for it, because when you have sex with someone, your body is suddenly permeable to their energy in a way that you cannot control. It releases all kinds of chemicals in the brain that are very powerful. And oftentimes that sense is too powerful. And you react, and you're afraid of it, and you pull back. But if you don't react and you go further, then the mind also becomes permeable to the other person, their energy and their desire. And so then it kind of creates a spiraling effect where the physical and the mental connection reaches the state that I call love sublime. Now, it's an ideal. It doesn't really exist that much out there in the world today, but there are stories in history that illustrate it. And I believe that is a biological necessity for us to feel a deep, deep sense of connection. We normally ascribe that to religion, to God, etcetera. But I maintain the essence of love. The model for love is between two human beings. Straight or homosexual, it doesn't matter. And that feeling of surmounting our own neurology, our own system, and entering this zone is deeply, deeply satisfying. We all want it, and it has to involve letting go of the power dynamics and everything being equal. It's not that the other person is exactly like you. You recognize their difference, but as far as being worthy of attention, being worthy and respected, you leave all that other stuff outside. So there is a zone that's possible, that's outside this power dynamic that we're talking about."

I couldn't help but think of some of the parallels between what you describe and what we're observing nowadays in the landscape of politics and social dynamics, where clearly there is no setting aside of egos. Both sides feel attacked. Everyone in between feels confused, like, why do I have to pick a side? And there seems to be no hint of a future where people are setting down their swords. Which means, if we were to go with your earlier definition, which I like a lot, that nobody feels safe enough to be vulnerable enough to allow the union of people to occur, which is just a way of rewording a bunch of other things, and not nearly as eloquently as you described it. But if setting aside of power dynamics and making oneself vulnerable is the key to accessing love in the romantic context, surely, but also in the societal context, what are the channels for that? I mean, I suppose there is the argument, not mine, that everyone should just take a boatload of psychedelics and see the interconnectedness of things, but that seems like an unrealistic route. I just don't see that being 12th grade graduation curriculum, nor do I think it would be healthy, to be clear. I think that we'd end up with a lot of expression of problems there.

And the feeling of being vulnerable is a very positive attribute that will infect not just your romantic relationships, but will infect you mentally. So creative people are extremely vulnerable. They're extremely vulnerable to ideas. They're extremely vulnerable to the environment and closing yourself off into your own ego, into yourself. So the chapter is called escape the prison of the ego. And you're kind of trapped inside of yourself and your own thoughts and your own desires. And it's like a prison. It's enclosing you, and you want to escape somehow, and you escape through drugs, you escape through porn, but it doesn't lead to actually escaping. You want to be able to let go of the self and get out of the. This prison that you're in. Right. And so it's a desire that we all have. And so I wanted to frame it as this incredibly positive dynamic that you can engage in and the ability to be vulnerable to other people, to open yourself up and to say that, yeah, they might hurt me, but I'm strong enough to take it, and if they hurt me, I'll learn from it and I'll rebound. And I know that's a bit naive on my part, but I want you to at least have that feeling, because a lot of young people write to me and they say, I can't fall in love anymore. I can't. I don't like that feeling. The loss of control is too much, you know, and a lot of that, their behavior patterns are in creating this sense of control which you can have when you're locked inside of yourself."

And you have these dreams and these hopes, and to let go of this possibility, which is deeply pleasurable and deeply therapeutic to the human animal as a social animal, it's like the highest form of interaction that we can have. So my strategy in that chapter was to paint such a wonderful portrayal of the pleasures that are awaiting you by letting go of your defenses, of letting go of all of your natural resistance factors. And opening yourself up to other people is a key to not just a romantic relationship, but to career success, to mental energy, to creativity, to being open in general. Right. And so I don't think I could have a wide, you know, a huge impact, but we'll see when the book comes out. But I'm advocating that sense of opening yourself up to the universe, to the cosmos itself, as an energy that permeates the world and so that you don't want to. The feeling of being closed inside of your ego, inside of yourself. I want to make it so you feel the pain of that because you don't really feel the pain of it. You feel like it's comfortable for you. But I want to make it clear to you that it's not comfortable. It's deeply, deeply painful, and it's disconnecting you from some of the best experiences you can have in life. So I have that strategy. The only other hope I have is in the human spirit itself. So a lot of this is being caused by social media, I believe. Right? And the kind of immediate gratification we can get in so many ways. And my hope is that young people get fed up and get disgusted with all this disconnection and alienation in their life, and that they hunger from actually something more communal, more interactive, more real, as opposed to virtual, and so that the human spirit can't be completely squashed by technology, etcetera. So I have that hope because we've gone through these cycles before in history where people have become very invulnerable and very locked and closed, and suddenly there's an explosion, a creative explosion, like in the 1960s, like in the 1920s, like in 18th century Europe with the Casanova, where seduction reached its kind of apogee, etcetera. So it has kind of swung back and forth between these moments where humans get incredibly closed and bitter and partisan and everything's conflict and everyone's divisive, etcetera, and suddenly it goes in the opposite direction. I have hope in that possibility and I structured my chapter to perhaps sweep that a little bit along that tie and see if I can have any effect."

I think it's exactly what's needed now, and certainly I'll be trying to amplify that message. I agree with everything you said, and not just because you're sitting here as a guest on this podcast, but because it's clear to me that while power dynamics and seduction are wired into our human relations since the beginning of time, that we have reached a very challenging period in our history. It's somewhat of a relief to me to know that it's happened before, but in a very different context. We hear a lot about the swinging back and forth of the pendulum. Someone, in fact, Peter Attia, online physician's brother, actually said, so we'll credit him. He said, no, it's not a pendulum that swings back and forth. Unfortunately, now it's become a wrecking ball. So it's swinging back and forth and doing damage as it reaches its extremes. And I think that I also look forward to a time where people acknowledge the injustices around them and that have been done to them and others, but somehow are able to transcend that. And the word that I'd like to pick up on there is the word justice. It was pointed out to me by someone I respect very much, that having a sense of justice is a wonderful and important thing. And as humans, it's important to how we structure society. But I do think that a lot of the negative things that we see out there nowadays have something to do with the availability of ready availability of pornography, high density calorie food, et cetera, a bunch of things like that. But one of the issues with social media, because it does have its positive aspects. But one of the negative issues in my mind is that it's a steady flow of examples of injustice. So all day long, you're just seeing things that piss you off and that piss other people off, and for different reasons. But what was pointed out to me is that one of the key things about a sense of injustice is to be able to determine whether or not there's anything that you should do about it. And I think that everyone now feels a bit hijacked by all the injustices we see, because we feel like, well, we're supposed to do something about it. But it may be that while we can't let every injustice pass, that being bombarded all day long with things that upset us is hijacking our creativity. It's distracting us from our deeper purpose. It's preventing a sense of vulnerability that would lead to a sense of deep love and on and on. So I don't think it's just about the. The tantalizing lures of sex, food, and looking at bodies and hearing voices on social media. I think there is some validity to that, but it's also that there's just ample opportunity to go down the gravitational pull forces of injustice. Like, that's so frustrating. Why are they doing that? I mean, I catch myself doing that talking to coworkers when I walk in about, did you see this thing? This is crazy. What's going on with it? They're crazy. As opposed to thinking about anything else in that moment. And I try and yank myself out of that, but I think that you're not gonna do it alone, but I think you will play a major role in saving us from this. Because people. I do. I think because people just need to see themselves through a different lens and realize this is distracting me from who I'm supposed to be."

I don't open it ever, because I know that they're designed algorithmically to put that in front of you every single time so that you click on it, because that's, we respond to that kind of stuff naturally. We can't help it. So you have to be able to shut that stuff up and look at what you can actually control in your life.

I read things that are kind of rational and intelligent, and I send them money and I, you know, I donate as much as I can and I help them practically, but I don't allow myself to get that kind of outraged feeling all of the time. So somebody has to write a book. Somebody has to instruct us in what to ignore and what to actually pay attention to. So there are things that you can control injustices that are out there that you could control by voting, by certain, by amassing a movement, by dealing with climate change, not by trying to recycle every little thing in your house, but actually doing something really much more macro in the world, joining a cause. There are things you can do, and that's positive, and that's a way of channeling that kind of dark energy in you for a positive purpose, but it's totally disruptive and it totally distracts you and weakens you and drains you of energy to fall into those rabbit holes and let them, and let yourself fall into them.

We all have a dark side. We all have hidden aggression. We all have feelings of envy. We all have feelings of grandiosity. We all have aggressive impulses. How do you deal with it? And I say the way to deal is to channel it into something positive and prosocial. And that can be putting it in your artwork, venting that anger and that outrage in something that people kind of can identify with, or it can be in organizing something that could be your purpose in life, in actually doing something positive. So that's the only way that you could actually use that energy for some kind of actual life's task or purpose."

Do you care to expand on that a bit? I think we could probably take three, 4 hours to explore all this in full. But I was struck by some of the things that you said, because I agree completely that just as we are not given a roadmap when we arrive in the world as to how to find our purpose, I think there's also a very conflicted roadmap that's thrown in front of us and indeed, conflicting, multiple roadmaps about what it means to be masculine or feminine or some combination of both, which, of course, everybody is some combination of both, just to varying degrees."

        "text": "Well, yeah. So men have a feminine side to them, which, if you try to repress it, will come out in other ways, and women have a masculine side to them. I think Jung described this very well with the anima and the animus, which I think is extremely real. It's very, very confusing times for both men and for women. Right now. We don't know the roles, that everything is just so fluid, and it's very, very difficult, particularly if you're young. So young women are getting this idea that everything should be equal and that women should have, and of course it's right, should have, be paid the same, and should have the same career opportunities. There should be no prejudice or harassment or anything. But at the same time, on social media, it's all about looking perfect. And looks are incredibly important. And if you're not hot, you're in terrible trouble. And a lot of young girls are extremely confused by this. They're getting mixed signals, right? And boys are even in perhaps even worse circumstance, where being masculine is seen as something negative. So we don't have any ideals out there anymore of what constitutes a good, positive form of femininity and a good, positive form of masculinity. In fact, we even think that there shouldn't be anything like that. There's no such thing as being masculine or feminine or whatever. It's very, very confusing. And so I think of masculine traits that I think are very positive that should be out there to kind of counteract the sort of Andrew Tate seduction that a lot of young men are falling for. And it's a kind of an inner strength where you're sort of in control of your emotions, you're not invulnerable, etcetera, etcetera. But you can take criticism, you can have moments of failure, and you'll bounce back, but you have a kind of inner resilience and a kind of inner strength, a kind of a quiet calm that I think used to be exemplified in movie icons. Like a Gary Cooper type thing. Right? And that kind of sense of inner calmness where you're not hysterical, you're not getting upset about everything that happens, where you have a kind of an inner strength and a confidence, and you can withstand kind of what Ryan holiday talks about a lot about with stoicism. You can withstand all of the hardships in life, but you have that citadel within you is a very, very powerful form of masculinity, as opposed to it's all about sleeping with a lot of women, having really fast cars, being abusive and being a bully, etcetera, etcetera. These are signs of weakness, of insecurity. And to be masculine should be a sense of security and inner confidence and inner strength. Right? And that's what we should venerate in our culture, and we should have icons like that. Okay? It doesn't mean that. That there's no role for men who are not masculine or who have more of the feminine virtues. There's definitely a role for that, and we see a lot of that in all sorts of arenas of life. And then there should be a positive model for women where instead of their appearances, being judged by their appearances and having to conform to ideals of what's hot or not, it's about. But being incredibly powerful and competent and have expertise and being really successful in your career, as opposed to being continually judged by your appearances, which is very damaging. So these are terrible times. I mean, I feel fortunate that I grew up in a time where there were these kind of models for me to go by. And I think of my father, who was a very quiet man, and he was just a middle class salesman, is basically what he was. He just sold for all his whole life, he sold chemical supplies for one company. But he was very dignified. He treated people well. He was very calm and very quiet. But he also was very empathetic. That was my role model for what I think is a good masculine energy. And I think a lot of people just don't have that, and they're very lost. And so I don't know what the answer is to that. I can't really produce that out of thin air, but I wish I could."

And as you pointed out before, a key feature to becoming a functional human being, especially nowadays, is learning what to ignore. I mean, there's an interesting idea in the circles around nutrition and health that never before in human history have human beings been able to access such a wide variety of foods that differ from what their ancestors ate. And I don't even mean ancient ancestors. I mean, if you grew up in the Bay Area, as I did in the 1970s and eighties, there were a few ethnic restaurants, but we ate the same 15 or 20 foods over and over again. And then eventually that exploded into dozens of options and more and fusion foods and all sorts of things. And so there is this idea in the nutrition communities that we are not hardwired to think about and discern so many different food options and to taste so many distinct flavors. Whereas before people portion of the planet or country, generally one way in a given season, if there's seasonality, et cetera, et cetera. In a similar vein, we are now, and children too, are now overwhelmed with a number of different options of how to express oneself, both masculinity and femininity. But generally speaking. And so the question is then, how does one choose? Right? How does one decide what's functional, what works, what's best, what's me? Right? Everyone asking themselves, who am I? Right? I think all teenagers, I find this fascinating, ask themselves, who am I? Adults don't tend to ask themselves that question, but who am I?"

So picking role models is something that I really, truly internalized from your book mastery. There were a lot of lonely years for me, and I won't get into the stories of just wondering, like, what am I gonna do? You know, I'm 13. My home was completely broken. No semblance of the reality it was before. You know, who are the males in my life? I'm going to orient to. And fortunately for me, I assigned mentors to me, whether or not they knew it or not. That really helped me along, and I changed them up, as you recommend. There wasn't one I understood there was a breaking up process, an integration process, combining and threading together different things. I think I truly believe that that's what's required. It doesn't have to be 100% Gary Cooper. It can be 10% Robert Greene, 10% someone else, 5% this. And creating a pie chart of sorts of who one wishes to be in a given context. But that takes work. It takes a bit of work and discernment, but, gosh, that's powerful. And credit goes to you, because you were a mentor of mine, you didn't even realize it in the way that you forge and organize information. And there were others, but mastery is where I learned to do that. And this is not a podcast. It's a sales pitch for mastery. But, gosh, it really taught me. Okay. I have a graduate advisor. She was wonderful and brilliant, but she didn't know how to explain a lot of things to me, so I'd find someone else for that and someone else for the other thing and someone else for the other thing, and together create a patchwork of really excellent mentors.

I had a series of people, like, you're talking about my high school English teacher, who had an enormous impact on me, who taught me basically how to write. I internalized his voice. When I went to Berkeley, I had a professor there who became my kind of surrogate father at Berkeley, who I deeply admired for his level of scholarship. So he became kind of an intellectual role model. Later in life, when I finally wrote my first book, I met a man, Jos Delfers, who was a book packager who understood the business, etcetera. He kind of saved me. He was sort of my mentor for the next phase in my life. So on and on and on, I found people, but they have positive qualities, qualities they admire. They're not perfect. Everyone is flawed. And so at some point, maybe you see too many of the flaws. You go on, I need somebody new in my life, but there's nothing wrong with that. It's not like you're violating any codes or hurting them. You move on to somebody else. But the sense of finding people whose qualities you admire, we don't learn from people just by following their ideas. We pick up their energy, their spirit. Now, you didn't necessarily pick up my energy or spirit from reading master, although maybe you did, I don't know. But when you're interacting with that professor at Stanford or whatever, it's not just verbally. There's kind of a nonverbal communication going on. You're internalizing some of the positive qualities that you saw in them and finding these series of mentors, because I call it surrogate parents, you can't choose your father and mother, but you can choose these ideals, for you can choose these mentors in your life. You can kind of rewrite your family history and find that father figure you never had by glomming onto this person. But it has to be the right fit. It has to be someone that you connect to emotionally and intellectually and that has the positive qualities you wish for yourself."

Not in every way, certainly, and certain names have been crossed off, but most of them have survived. And certainly after reading mastery, your name made that list."

But by being essentially scientifically orphaned because there's a strong mentor mentee relationship in science and progression through the career track, it forced me to go out and find other people and also to learn how to, quote unquote, mother and father myself in the context of profession. And I got a lot of help, but I can't emphasize enough how valuable that practice is. And so when one looks out on the landscape of social media options, I mean, these are literally just options of people to, we call it following, but it probably should be called something else because following falls short of emulating or attempting to emulate. But I think that in the context of masculine and feminine ideals, this is so critical. But it's like the buffet of food is so enormous now, right?

Whereas if I know, okay, I cannot have this food. I can't have that. I'm only looking for this. Okay? It's easy. It doesn't take 2 hours, waste my time. Too much choice is very detrimental to the human being, I think. And that's why going back to what I originally said, when you have that sense of purpose about your life, about what's important, it not just infects your career, but infects everything you do. So, you know, eating this food is going to drain me of my energy that I need to create this thing that means so much to me. And energy and feeling my brain active and alive is an incredibly important value. All right? I'm not going to eat all that sugar because it's bad for me, right? It means I'm not going to get outraged by these things on the Internet because it's a waste of time. I can't do anything about it. It's just feeding on my, you know, on my, I forget the part of the brain that's, that's like the amygdala or whatever, right? So, no, I don't want to go there, right? And on and on and on. All these things on social media. Some of it's good, some of it's interesting. I can follow Andrew Huberman's podcast, and I enjoy that and I learn a lot from it. But a lot of these podcasts are useless. They're not helping me in any way. So it gives you this kind of filter and this radar to cut out those hundred different choices that drive us absolutely crazy. And I know maybe I'm partially, maybe I'm a little bit, I don't know, I hate to say that maybe I'm partially on the spectrum or something, but I can't, trance can't stand too many choices. It completely drives me nuts. So I always have to kind of funnel my energy into something, to things that are productive. And having a sense of your purpose whenever you discovered in your twenties, hopefully gives you that ability to say, these are the positive role models I want in my life. These are the mentors. And the thing about following people on social media is it's so easy. It's just a click. It doesn't mean anything. A mentor relationship takes work, it takes courage, because you have to actually go up to somebody and physically ask for their help. And a lot of people write to me say, I'm afraid of asking this important, powerful person to be their mentee. Right? So it involves a sense of social courage where you have to literally engage with another human being who you admire and who you think is powerful. So it's building your social skills, etcetera, but it's a skill you develop. You can't just follow someone, you can't just watch their lectures. You have to engage with them and you have to get over some of your fears and your anxieties in the process."

Like, I think hearing about a book is great. Reading a book is even better. Thinking about a book that you read is even better than that. And then writing down your own ideas and writing a book, well, that's the big win, right? And that's what the world, I believe that's what the universe wants from us. Not necessarily to write a book, but translate what I just said to any number of different endeavors."

        "text": "You want to be able to think for yourself, right? So you're not just absorbing ideas from other people and kind of mimicking them and kind of just learning the exteriors of their ideas. You want to kind of digest them and then have them slowly become your own ideas by interacting with them and by creating, like putting them through your own lens. So someday it's, it's a book stirring in me is the art of thinking and how to use that kind of process and go deeper into it. And I talked a lot about it in one of my podcasts, which might be the seed of a book, but it's the difference between dead thinking and alive thinking. Ideas can be either alive or they can be dead. And an alive idea is something that enters your brain from an external source, a philosopher, an article, somebody you admire, somebody you hate. And then you absorb it, and you think about it, and you decide, I'm going to turn it around into this, and I'm going to make it alive and make it something that's part of me. Another part of an alive idea is you have an idea that comes to you about a book or a project or something about the world, and you go, maybe that's not actually true. Maybe the opposite is true. And you go through a process, and you cycle through it on and on, and you reflect on it, and you refine this idea, and maybe it turns into its opposite. And through the process of reflecting and correcting and revising it, you turn it into something living, something alive within you. Right? On and on and on. And what prevents people from going through that process, which would be the subject of my book, is basically anxiety. Because I think how you handle anxiety is the most important kind of quality in life. It'll determine whether you will be successful, whether you will find your career path, or whether you won't be able to. I don't know if you can follow that idea at all. But anxiety is a signal to you that you don't understand something, that there's a problem out there that you can't resolve. And so what happens to most people if you're insecure is you glom onto something instant and easy to get rid of, your feeling of anxiety. I don't understand this problem. Oh, it must be a. Must be the answer because this person said that, right? And so you don't develop the ability to think, you don't develop the ability to go to the next level. But if you take that anxiety and you go, all right, maybe a is an answer, and then you start going through a, and then you go, no, maybe a isn't the answer. Maybe b is the answer, you're able to surmount your anxiety and go past it further and further and further. You don't rush for the first available answer that's out there. Right. You're able to go through a process of refining things. And so in your career, if you're anxious for success, if you're anxious for money, you're going to make the wrong choices. But if you're able to deal with that anxiety and say, maybe I have to think more deeply about where I'm going, I have to come up with other alternatives, then you're going to make a much better choice on and on and on. So how, if you're dealing, if you're a creative person, it's very, very challenging to have that blank piece of paper before you, that book that you haven't written, that film or whatever. You're filled with a lot of anxiety and you have to deal with it. And if you're able to turn it into something creative and productive, then great things will happen. You'll create a masterpiece. So the ability to deal with anxiety and to not give into the most instant gratification that you can get is, to me, a marker of somebody who will be creative and will invent something, as opposed to people who just recycle old and dead ideas."

Nor should we. Right? Because it's a signal, as you point out, that we don't understand something, that there's something to get curious about, a process or something out there, or both. I think that really resonates. I think a lot of people will benefit from hearing that, because I think we hear the word flow and we just all imagine. I even catch myself imagining that when Robert Greene sits down to write, it's like there's a blank sheet. And then he just kind of meditates and then, boom, outcome these books.

If I let it out into the world, it'd be very embarrassing. It's anxious. And my wife can tell you I'm a miserable being when that happens. Everything looks black to me at that point, and I push through it. So if I gave in to my anxiety, and this happens with a lot of books and writers, I would just put out that second version, which isn't very good. It isn't very strong. It isn't thought through, because my ideas, when I look at them the first time, I go, that's not real. That's not the actual thing that's going on here. Robert, you've missed the mark.

Particularly if you can't have a conversation with them about subjects that interest you? And so you mentioned animals. Animals is a very good example because it's not. I'm not saying that you both have to be Democrats or Republicans. That's too banal and superficial. But the love of animals reaches into your character, reaches something deep inside of you or your dislike of animals, if that happens to be the case. But it signals something about it that's so primal, that's so connected to a child, that there's going to be a deep connection there. And it's not like you have to both love cats, which is good if that happens to be the case, but just animals in general. You love their energy. You love the fact that they're, that they're innocent in their own way. You love the fact that they're not playing games with you. You love the kind of instant love you can get from them kind of thing, and you connect to them on that level is a very, very positive sign because it goes beyond just intellectual things into something emotional and visceral. So really, the emotional connections, the values that you have together are very important. Money is another one that's extremely important. So if one of you is incredibly material oriented, and it's all about money, is power and success and comfort, and the other isn't really into it, is into spending money, etcetera, a lot of people have endless fights or something like money, right, where there's no convergence there, and money signals a deeper value about the person. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong if money motivates you. I'm not moralizing about it, because that can signal a value that maybe you grew up without it. And that feeling comfortable and feeling like you don't have to worry about something is very, very important to you, and they'll not being interested in money reveals something about your character. So I'm telling people you want to look at the person's character and see a kind of convergence there and something that can last. And I remember I was reading for one of my books about Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. And the thing of it was, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was this incredibly handsome, vibrant young man before he got polio. Very active, very athletic, very handsome. All of the women were after him. He was like the perfect match. He was wealthy, and Eleanor Roosevelt was like the ugly duckling. She wasn't very pretty. She was kind of socially awkward. But he saw into her character. He saw that intellectually she was a match for him. He saw that they had kind of similar interests on that level that I'm talking about, that go beneath just the surfaces. And he chose Eleanor, and everyone was shocked about it. You know, nobody was trying to court Eleanor. I wrote her last name. At the time, I think she might have even been Roosevelt. So it was very shocking. He said, I looked at somebody who I could last with, who had some qualities that were much more important to me, and it ended up being a very satisfying relationship. Of course, later on, he had his dalliances. So it wasn't perfect, but it was a very positive relationship. So seeing your values in life, you know, when it comes to, like, money, when it comes to, like, career, when it comes to comfort or lack of comfort, some people like not being comfortable. They like being on the edge. They want challenges, they want to move from city to city kind of thing. And if you partner with somebody who just wants to live in the same house, you're going to have conflict after conflict after conflict. The sex might be great, and that might be good for a month or two months. I have nothing against that. I'm not going to judge that either. But it won't lead to a long lasting relationship. You know, sports and athletics are another thing. Is this someone that likes the outdoors or someone who's, you know, like Zsa Zsa Gabor and has to be in a Times square in a penthouse in Manhattan, you know, kind of thing. So values that reach inside of a character that are deeply ingrained, that you can almost not change, you can't control. There's a convergence there on several levels, is a sign that you can have a deep connection with that person, and it's very important. And if those connections are good and there's a physical attraction, because without the physical attraction, it will kind of fizzle out. You've got a recipe for incredible success, for something that can really last. And having a lasting relationship, as I've had, is such an anchor in your life. You know, for me, for someone who works as hard as I do, and hopefully for her as well, it just grounds me, and it makes life so much simpler and easier. And it's not just simple and easy. There's a lot of love and a great deal of deeper emotions involved. But having a long term relationship, if you can have it, is something that pays off in so many dividends. So being able to find that kind of convergence, you know, when I first met my, now my wife, I had a cat at the time, I'd always been a dog person, but this was a cat I had, and I loved that cat like hell. I can't believe he was such a wonderful cat. I brought her over to my apartment on the first date. I wanted to see her reaction to the cat, you know, because I generally, and I don't know, people misjudge that. Women who don't like cats, I can't get along with, right? Because there's something feline in the feminine nature that I love. And she loved my cat. Boy, that was the best sign of all. And things just blossom. And she loved me for loving a cat. So there was a great convergence right there that we saw right away, and there were other things, but that was the first one."

You go by the things that culture tells you that these are the right images for you, right? And then there won't be any connection to you because you're choosing for purposes that don't connect to who you are. And so you have to know yourself. You have to know what you love. You have to know what you hate. I think most people know that they love animals or don't love animals. I think most people know that they like stability, or they like things to be kind of slightly chaotic. I don't think you have to go through deep levels of introspection, but what you have to do is when you're involved in a relationship, you have to think that those things matter. That's the problem. You tend to think that those things. You think that sex matters more than anything, physical attraction matters, or you think that the person having a lot of money matters, et cetera, et cetera.

One telling sign that I've noticed in my own relationships in the past is that the woman would be a certain way with me that I thought was very good and I liked. And then the moment we were with other people, she acted in a way that was very irritating. It's like a different character, and I really kind of fell out of love with her. When I saw her in social interactions, she revealed so with me, she was almost wearing a mask and playing a game. But the moment she entered a different circumstance, I saw other aspect to her character. So you also have to be very attentive to their character. What lies underneath that they have some of these values that they're not just trying to win you over for whatever and are playing along with you. The other thing that's very important is a sense of mystery. So a partner can become boring very, very quickly, right? After a year, you know every single thing about them. Right. They're going to say the same things. Those conversations go around in circles. It's just you've reached an end. There's no surprises, there's no mystery. You want somebody where they have corners that you don't really see at first, that they surprise you. Sometimes. Suddenly there's a quality that you hadn't suspected before. So people who are too obvious, who are too familiar, who show everything instantly, they're going to end up boring you. Right? But people who have a bit of reserve, I don't. Maybe I'm projecting my own values on the world, but people who kind of intrigue you that you don't fully understand, that make you want to know more. And if they can be like that after two years or three years or five years, wow, that's fantastic. But the sense of, I know every single thing about this person, they never surprise me anymore, is what kind of breaks the enchantment and leads to the end of the relationship."

During the four episode series that we did on mental health, Paul Conti, a psychiatrist, said that a matching of generative drives, which he defined as the desire to create something in the world of one's own expression, is really critical in relationship. And he said it matters less whether or not one person likes classical music and the other person rock and roll, provided that their relationship to music is similar or something of that sort, that it's about a drive of a certain sort to engage in the world. So one person could love music, the other person's not into music. But the way that they approach life is one of perhaps mutual curiosity, desire to find out, etcetera, and that this exists on a continuum. I'm curious if it seems to jive with what you're saying."

I'm not saying one is superior to the other, but it reveals something that's nonverbal, that gives you a window into who they are. So if they like punk rock like you do, and I grew up on punk rock, there's a rebellious thing. There's an anti authoritarian quality that's very strong. You get to see that through them. If they like Mozart and soft string quartets, there's somebody that kind of values softness and tranquility and peace, and you're not like that. So the music kind of shows you something, a quality about their character that can be very telling and be very eloquent. And so it doesn't mean that you both have to love the clash or the dead Kennedys or whatever, showing my own generation. But that you both have that rebellious streak, and that rebellious streak could be you. Like, there's classical music composers who could be pretty damn rebellious and angry, you know, and I actually kind of like them. So that convergence, I think, is a positive one kind of thing.

Yeah, maybe include professional relationships, too, because what you just described is really about a resonance around the nonverbal stuff. I mean, it can be articulated with words. I love animals. I love this music. This is the best song. Like, did you see that? Like, otters are amazing, right? This kind of thing. But language is just an attempt to place, you know, words on a feeling in those instances. So it can be classified as nonverbal. With respect to nonverbal communication, you've written fairly extensively about the fact that people often communicate with their body and facial expressions. I'm certainly familiar with the somewhat if not very eerie sensation of somebody smiling like a toothy smile. And then as they pivot away, that smile just dissolving very quickly. And you don't have to be a neuroscientist or a psychologist to realize that there was something quite false about that experience or that this person experiences emotions, like step functions, on, off, on, off, which is not how most of us experience emotions. Most of us experience emotions with some pervasiveness. Like, I was happy walking in the door because of something that happened before, and so I'm gonna smile. While I'm walking in the door, if I see something shocking and dismaying, of course I'm gonna frown. I'm gonna wipe away that smile. Those are rare instances.

It's a language of the gifts that you give. It's a language of. Of how you smell. It's a language that you communicate through the eyes, et cetera, et cetera. And the thing you have to understand about the human being is that we evolved for a much longer period of time without words than the small 40, 35,000 years that we have symbolic language. So during that vast period of darkness where we did not have words, we were non communicating non verbally. We were picking up signals from people. We were watching every little detail of their behavior because we didn't have words to decipher it. So it's wired into our brains to have an amazing sensitivity to people's nonverbal communications. We can almost be telepathic that way if we learn that language. The problem is we have the capacity, but we don't develop it at all because we are so word oriented. You're just listening to people. If you're even listening to them at all, you're just hearing the words. And you're so thinking that the words mean something, that the words are sincere, which they're often not. At the same time that you're listening so much to words, people are shuffling in their chair. They're kind of looking away. They're looking at other women or other men. Their voice is kind of trembling when they say something that where it shouldn't tremble, their eyes are dead. The smile is kind of fake. You're not watching any of it. So the most important thing in nonverbal communication, law number one, is pay attention to it. Continually develop the practice of shutting off the words and watching people. Almost as if you took the television and muted it, right, and just watched their behavior. It's not easy, and it's not natural, because it's the words. The words were words. We want to. Want to focus on them, right? But your ability to turn that television off, to mute it, will suddenly open up so many things about people. They reveal so much things. Sigmund Freud said, people are continually oozing out all of their secrets through their nonverbal behavior. You can read them like an open book if you master this language, and I have the laws of human nature. I described the story of Milton Erickson. I don't know if you're familiar with Milton Erickson, perhaps the greatest modern master of nonverbal communication. He was an amazing psychologist. He sort of is the inspiration behind n, what's it called? N, help me out here. Neuro linguistic. Oh, the NLP."

He couldn't even move his eyeballs right, and he sat in bed, and he had a very active mind, and he was going to just die from sheer boredom. And what he did during the two years of being paralyzed like that was just watching people's nonverbal communication and making notes in his brain and learning every single. He learned the 20 different forms of yes, the hundred different forms of no. Right. Every intonation, how somebody entered the room, how they left the room, you know, how they looked at him with the pity or empathy or something. He mastered it. And then when he became a psychiatrist and he treated people, they thought he was psychic. He could see everything into them. It's because for two years, that's all he could do was observe them. He couldn't speak. He couldn't do anything. He couldn't read a book. So you have that same power, but you don't have polio, obviously, but you have to first pay attention to it, right? It's an amazing thing. Once you do, it's a lot of fun, actually. And I tell people, go to a cafe one day in your city, wherever you live, and just watch people, because you can't hear them. They're a few tables away. Watch their non verbal behavior as they interact and see if you pick up cues from them. And they're things that are signs of genuine emotions. So, for instance, an exercise you can do is you go up to somebody from an angle where they can't see you coming up to them, and you surprise them. You go, hey, hey, Mike, whatever. They turn for that second, their expression reveals how they really think about you. You'll detect if you can pick up micro expressions, and you can. They're only like one, one 50th of a second, but they're there. You express a kind of. And they smile. You can see the little disdain in their eyes, right? Then the mask comes on, right? Or you're talking to them, they're looking at you, but their feet are facing in an opposite direction. That means that they're dying to get away from you. Kind of thing. These are signals that you don't necessarily pay attention to. Their posture will tell you everything about their levels of confidence. Right? On and on and on. The fake smile. If you can just master the ability to detect the fake smile, it will go wonders for you, because you're able to see. What you really want to do is to see the person with a genuine smile. Particularly in romantic relationships, someone whose face lights up. A real smile lights your whole face up. It doesn't light your mouth. These parts of your face go up. Your eyes get alive. There's like a neural thing going on in your brain that's changing your whole facial expression, and it means that someone genuinely likes you. They're genuinely interested in you, they're genuinely laughing or connecting to you, man, if you can see that, it'll help you so much in the romantic realm and that it'll help you get away from those toxic people that are continually faking interest in you. Because a narcissist, a toxic person, thrives by deceiving you with a charming, alluring front that makes you come into their world. Then they can hurt you, then they can do something to you. Then they have you in their trap. So being able to see that they're not genuinely interested in you, that they're faking it, will help you avoid very toxic relationships. And as I said to you, I don't know if we were on air or not, but deep narcissists have dead eyes. They almost can't help it. They can fake the smile. They can fake everything else. But the eyes. You have to be able to read it because you say, well, what are dead eyes? You'll know it when you say, see it. There's no life in them. They're, like, looking through you. They're not looking at you. They're looking through you. What can I get of you? You're what they call a self object. They're an object for you to use, and that's how they're looking at you.

I mean, they're literally two pieces of brain lining the back of your eyes and the dynamics of the pupils. Those changes, of course, reflect how bright or dim it is in the room, but they also reflect levels of arousal that are on the millisecond time scale. So as one expresses words of glee, the pupils constrict a little bit, believe it or not. Excuse me, dilate a little bit. I got it backwards there for a moment. And vice versa, as one feels less excited. Moments of despair, expressions of despair that people should get a little bit smaller because arousal is going down.

Something's wrong about them, and then you forget it because you don't trust those initial unconscious signals that your brain is giving you. Right? So you have to first kind of trust that these intuitions are very valuable. The other thing is pay deep attention to the tone of voice. The voice, as actors will tell you, is like the hardest thing to fake. Right? It's very hard to fake excitement. Your voice either has it or it doesn't. It's very hard to fake confidence. And you can. I mean, books have been written about that. I'm not going to go into all the details about it, but the person will reveal so much of their emotional, the emotions that they're experiencing, particularly levels of confidence, you know, like a trembling voice or something, or a booming, confident voice, which some people can fake. But often it's very difficult. You can still see through it. And on the level of seduction, women, men are very, very attuned to the voice of a woman, but we're not aware of it because the voice of our mother had an incredible impact on us in early, early, early childhood. Her singing, the tone of her voice, that was probably the first seduction that we ever went through. And a woman's voice has tremendous power over us, right? And so hearing a voice that kind of grates or irritates you is something that's a bad sign and that goes deeper than all the characteristics that we were talking about.

But the sort of qualitative differences between the inputs have been binned into a couple of simple bins. It's as if we've regressed to primary colors only, but the canvas is huge. I don't know if that analogy works, but you get the idea, because ultimately, in order to develop good choices about profession, romantic relationships, friendships, you need a lot of examples and a lot of information that allows you to glean the subtlety. But as long as it's emojis and filtered pictures taken at a particular angle, usually from above, ask for the picture head on and below, send me a picture of your worst expression, all of that.

If it's rotating, you're still only seeing sides of it. Only in your mind can you picture the whole thing. So the mind has to go through a process to have holistic thinking. If they can invent a machine that can deal with anxiety and has anxiety and can go to level three, if they can make a machine that can be self aware, that can go. The people who program me have biases. Therefore I have biases. I also have a dark side because people have programmed me who have a dark side. If this machine can also think holistically beyond all of the data points and all the massive information it's combined, and can have that aha moment, all right, I can see a human consciousness. I can see creativity there. The other thing I would say is, when I was a student at Berkeley, going way back, I was 19 years old, I decided one summer it was a big paradigm shift for me. I'm going to take this class in ancient Greek. In six weeks. They teach you a year of ancient Greek. That means every day you have an exam. Every Friday you have a final exam, 8 hours every day of a dead language. I thought this would be the best discipline for me after someone who'd been doing too many drugs, to be honest with you. Okay? And so finally, at one point, they give us this paragraph of the hardest ancient greek writer of all to read. This was near the end. Thucydides, or thucydides, as they say. I stared, so I had, like, the whole night to try and translate one paragraph. I couldn't figure it out. You have to understand the weirdness of ancient Greek, all the endings, the weird ways of thinking, the whole picture. That aha moment was eluding me. At one point, I thought I got it, and I translated it, and I gave it to the teacher next day. And I remember he was this kind of hippie that you'd have at Berkeley. Dentist, classics professor, but also a hippie."

Or what have happened if I put it through chat GPT, and it gave me the translation? That muscle in my brain that I have developed for 40 years that allows me to write books would never have developed. And that muscle is. I don't know the answer here. I have to go to another level. I have to try harder. I have to think, I have to think, I have to have that engine whirring around, right? But if I just grab for GPT, it's deadened. And then we're gonna have a whole generation of people who stop thinking, who don't go through that process. You know, you've heard of Douglas Hofstadter. I think he said, people train to go to Mount Everest. It takes months, physical exertion. It's painful. Then they climb Mount Everest, they see the top. Whoa, what a great moment. He said, cha PT would be the equivalent of taking a helicopter to the top of Mount Everest without any of that training and having the same moment. It's not the same. Right? You need to go through that process. You need to go through that pain. And if you just. And the thing of this chat GBT, we think we're so modern, so sophisticated, but really we're just seduced by magic. You put it in there and you see the screw going, whoa. It's like magic. It's like a magician, but it's empty. It's like not your brain functioning, right? It's the pagan part of us. We like that kind of magic as opposed to actually having to go through the thought process itself. So I'm not against having tools. I use tools. I use the Internet, I use Google. I'm searching for, like, some factoid from my book. I find it, I use it, I like it. But I've also learned to develop my brain, to think, to get that engine constantly moving.

A prior guest on this podcast, Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's an expert in emotions, talked about how the moment that a culture has a word for a particular subset of anxious feelings. So, for instance, she taught me that in Japanese, there's a word for the sadness one experiences when they get a bad haircut."

In science, we say there are lumpers and there are splitters, and they've been arguing for years about, like, is that one brain structure? Well, if I name those two things next to each other, two different things, not only can I name one after myself, which is what tends to happen, so to speak, but when you have too many lumpers or too many splitters, things are either overly simple or overly complex. That, of course, the right answer, the best use of naming things, arrives someplace in the middle. That's how a field progresses. Because if you lump things together too much, a field can't progress. You give yourself the illusion that it's progressing, but it's not progressing. But if you split things up into a million different subcategories, like, just even the word adrenaline is also called epinephrine, and that has to do with, basically, people arguing over who got credit. Crazy. And it's confused people for decades. Yeah. Then there's another story there that, and I know far too much about the scientists involved. And there was a love triangle about naming of certain parts of the nervous system that. Oh, yeah, people sleeping with other people's partners. And love triangles have created more drama of nomenclature in science. I could do a whole hour on this. In any case, what I'm hearing from you is that we cannot afford to lose our sense of nuance, and also because that sense of nuance taps into what we're really experiencing, and AI threatens that, that we can become avatars of ourself."

What we really should worship is the human brain, which is the greatest creation in the known universe. I'm afraid it is the most complex piece of matter in the entire universe. The number of neurons, the number of synapses, the number of possible connections between neurons is infinite, practically infinite. It is a wondrous instrument. It is so powerful, we've barely scratched the surface of what we can use for it. Let us worship that brain that's in your head. You only have so many years to use it. You have so many years to develop it. It is so wonderful and powerful. It can bring you such pleasure, so much power in life. Tools are fine. We all need tools. We all need hammers. We need nails. We need saws, etcetera. But the real thing is the hand that uses it, the brain that connects the hand to the hammer that knows how to hit things? You know, I think of the great painter Renoir in the 19th century. He had, like, a stroke or something that in the last years, he couldn't move his right arm, which he painted with, and it was disastrous. So what he did is he put the brush in his mouth and he painted. And he painted some beautiful paintings that way, because his brain had mastered the art of painting, not his hand, but his brain had mastered it so well that he could actually paint well with the brush in his mouth, because he could direct it, and he had the knowledge of how to make something perfect. The brain is absolutely incredible. The plasticity of the brain, which I'm discovering after my stroke, is absolutely a miracle. I don't know. Is it Professor Schwartz at UCLA who was studying OCD and how he was able to cure people of OCD through certain plasticity exercises that he had, making them aware of their kind of brain lock, etcetera, and getting them out of it. That plasticity of the brain is by far the greatest miracle of all, and it goes on until your sixties and seventies and onward. Let's all get down on our hands and knees and worship the brain. And if we did, it would create a complete shift in our values, and we wouldn't be so instantly seduced and enamored and worshipping the technology. We would worship the brains that create the technology instead of the other way around."

They should have won two Nobels, frankly, for their other work on vision. But one thing that they missed, however, was something that you mentioned and is worth highlighting again, which is that the brain maintains the capacity for immense plasticity throughout the entire lifespan. That's absolutely clear. The conditions change from early to later in life, but your specific situation really highlights that. And it's something I'd really like to talk about for a few minutes, if you're willing. As you mentioned, you experienced a stroke, and perhaps it was aware to some, but perhaps not all, especially the people just listening to this podcast and who are not watching on video, that your shirt, while very nicely designed in its original state, also includes some unique stitching. So maybe you could share with us. And for those listening, there's a jagged line of stitching that extends from Robert's left short sleeve to his midline, to where the buttons on his shirt are, and from the from his right short sleeve, also to the midline offset from one another. These. This is the sort of stitching that looks like perhaps I had been at the sewing machine and not somebody was skilled, but they did a good job, basically, of putting it back together. Why are those stitches in your shirt? Tell us about the stroke, and let's, let's talk about neuroplasticity."

August 17, 2018. I was driving my car. She was with me. I was pulling out into traffic. I started driving, and suddenly she'd say, pull over, Robert. Pull over. Why? Why? I can drive. I'm fine. And then suddenly, everything started getting really strange. Everything looked strange. My voice didn't sound the same, and she was, like, freaking out. But she was actually fairly calm, which was amazing. I was undergoing a stroke. I had a blood clot that was blocking the blood flow to my brain. I actually, at one point, got out of the car like I was. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. And then she pulled me back in, and the rest goes blank. And I had some weird sensations that still remain with me because essentially, I was on the verge of dying. Because blood not flowing to your brain is basically the end of you. Right? Unless something happens very quickly, and she. Either that, or you're going to get severe brain damage. So she called 911 right away. She recognized something. My whole face was looking funny. And they got there, I was unconscious, and essentially, they took this shirt, and I just scissored the thing in half and took it off my head. And then they intubated me, I believe, in my hip area to get something. The blood clot was in my neck, and they were able to free it up, and they rushed me to the hospital, and I'm unconscious. And then I wake up, and I'm in a gurney in the hospital, and I don't. For a moment, I'm thinking maybe I'm dead because I'm lying in a gurney, and I almost feel like I'm in a coffin. I don't know what's going on, and I have all of these weird sensations. And I tell people, we're so curious about death. We think about death a lot, and, you know, is it final? What does it mean? We really should pay attention to dying. Dying is actually much more interesting in some ways than death. And people who have died go through a process, if it's long enough. And people who have had near death experiences, like I do, have gone through that process of dying and have come back to life. And in the process of dying, strange things happen to the brain, right? So particularly with a stroke or something like that, where blood stops flowing to your oxygen, stops flowing to your brain, you have kind of visions and things that you might think are hallucinations, but that later seem like actually you are actually glimpsing the reality, as opposed to the illusion that the brain creates. So I've written about this in my new book. But my idea of the brain is that it creates endless series of illusions for you. It creates this seamless version of reality, the sense of a self, the sense of a continuous self through time, right? It creates a linear sense of time progressions. It creates colors. It creates a world that visually, you can, seems familiar, and et cetera, et cetera. But it's all illusion. It's all a construction, right? Images come into your brain, and they're not organized in any way. And the brain organizes in a way that you can understand it. Well, when you're dying, all of that scrambles up, and you actually are seeing something else. So I saw, for instance, that I really don't have a self, that it doesn't really actually exist. And the image that came to my mind because it was sitting in that gurney was a weird feeling of, like, I can almost not explain it, but it's as if you took an image of something real in the world, and you completely scrambled it up, and it was all wavy, and you couldn't see what exactly it was. To me, that was the image I had of the self. There are, like, 50 different selves inside of you that are all competing, and you think there's just one, and you think it's consistent, but there's not. It's an illusion. The self is literally an illusion that your brain constructs. When you're dying, you see these things. When you're dying, you see other things like that. You see that time is something very weird. So I had experience of when I got out of the car and I got pulled in, I thought, like, 10 seconds had passed. My wife told me, no, this was like, ten minutes. I had no sense of time. Everything was scrambled. And so it was very, very eloquent. It taught me so much, things that I can barely even express now. I'm always now thinking of strange things that come to me because my brain was damaged. It made me realize that the brain creates everything. So I can't communicate with my hand, my fingers. I can't communicate. My brain can't communicate with my leg. Right? So you think that walking and riding and handling things is just your body operating a certain way. It's your brain telling you how to move these different things. When that brain stops functioning, you realize how much your brain determines everything. It all starts there. And when there's damage to your brain, your whole thinking alters, etcetera. Not to mention how you look at life itself after something like that. So it was a terrible experience. It's ruined so many things that I loved in life, but it's given me an awful lot as well in return that I could go on for hours and talk about, because it was the most powerful experience of my life."

So that's a caveat here, and I'm aware of it, but I had this vision that I was dead when I first became conscious, and that I was up in the sky, and I was looking down, and my mother and my wife were talking. And over my grave, I suppose. And I had this feeling, huh, everything's okay. I'm gone, but life goes on. They're doing fine. It's okay, right? So I don't know about that sense of self, whether it was like I'm aware of it happening, but I have a feeling it was something from the outside. I don't really know the answer to that because it's very confused. The other feeling I had was life. When I was having the stroke, was life draining out of me, and my bones getting softer and softer and softer. And I can't really logically explain that. The feeling of bones softening up and dissolving. But for weeks and months afterwards, I could access that feeling of my bones dissolving, etcetera. It was a feeling of all your energy draining out of you, and you're dying, literally. So reading books about near death experiences. Cause that's a lot of what I'm a big part of my next book.

I had to learn what really matters and to have patience and stuff. The other thing was, I used to love hiking. I was very physically active. And I'm sitting at my window in my office and see people running up and down, bicycling, walking their dogs. God, I'm so envious. If I could walk a dog right now, I'd be the happiest person alive. But then I go through a thought process which maybe isn't completely healthy, which is they're not aware of how wonderful it is just to walk a dog, but I'm aware of it.

I truly appreciate it now because I know that my brain was almost gone, right? So it means so much for me. And to just be alive, you know, is just a wondrous experience. I have a chapter in my new book called awaken to the strangeness of being alive. And it's about the fact that if you think about it and how unlikely it is that we humans evolved at all, even that we even existed. All the bottlenecks and evolution that we had to pass through, including the disappearance of the dinosaurs and the emergence of mammals, but there are 20 other huge bottlenecks throughout the history of evolution. We had to pass through all of those. We nearly went extinct 80,000 years ago from some virus that infected. There were only 8000 people, humans on the planet. All these different things. And here we are with Zoom meetings, et cetera, et cetera. It's like the strangest story you can ever. It's beyond science fiction, but nobody thinks about it. Nobody sits down and goes, God, I'm alive. If you went back to the chain of people that had to connect and have children leading up to your parents, the unlikeliness of you ever being born is astronomical. I mean, unless my science is all wrong, you know, 70,000 generations of people meeting, et cetera, et cetera, finally ending at your DNA. I mean, unless I'm missing something, it's pretty unlikely. But nobody thinks about it. Well, I certainly think about it now because I almost died. I had nothing else to think about. I have to entertain my brain the way Milton Erickson had to entertain himself by observing people. So it's taken a lot away from me. I can't swim. I'm riding my recumbent bike, which I love, and 80 year old grandmothers are zipping by me. And God damn it, how awful. I was so envious. My insecurities all well up. But then I realize, hey, I'm like, I'm on a boat. I'm sailing. It's wonderful. I'm outside. I have to go through these processes.

It's called 33 Strategies of War, but it's really about strategy, the strategic thinking. It's inspired from Sun Tzu, the great chinese strategist. But it has vast philosophical implications. The idea is you can almost think of it like barometric pressure, when necessity is pressing in on you, like your back is against the wall, like you have to get something done and there's like this pressure around you, you find energy in there that you never believed before. William James talks about this when he talks about getting a second wind. He explains it very eloquently. When you feel like your life's in danger, suddenly you can leap over things that you never could leap over before. So Sun Tzu says, put an army on death ground and it will fight until it wins. Meaning put an army with its back to the ocean or back to the mountain, and it's either win or die. They're going to fight ten times harder. You're going to find the energy in you that you normally lack when death is facing you in the face, or urgency or deadlines, or people pressing in on you. When that barometric pressure loosens up and there's none of it, you think you have all the time in the world, you get nothing done. Wow, man, I'm 23. I've got all these years ahead of me. I'm going to figure it out, right? I'm not going to die. I got 50, 70, 80 years ahead of me. No, you don't. That pressure now is gone and you're wasting time. You're doing all sorts of things that aren't leading to any kind of skill. You're not learning or anything. You need to put yourself on death ground. You need to feel that barometric pressure, which is the actual reality. The actual reality is you could die tomorrow. You could have a stroke tomorrow. You could be fired tomorrow. Everything could fall apart. You need to have that sense of urgency now because that's the reality. You're fooling yourself by thinking you have all of this time. And so when you feel that pressure, suddenly you can move mountains, you have energy, your life, you just have focus, etcetera. Neurologically, everything clicks in. And people who've had that experience where they felt like the ship was going under and they better get their act together and survive. They talk about all these physical processes. I have a story in my new book. I hope I'm not boring here with all. No, quite the opposite, about a mountain climber who. He was climbing this mountain by himself and he was having a great time, but there was a storm coming and he had to get down and he suddenly fell and he cut his leg open massively and there was like a branch sticking in it and he broke all these bones and he was going to die. He was on a ledge, he could see that it was getting dark and storm clouds were massing. This was in the rocky mountains. He was alone. And suddenly he managed to get up on his 2ft and he can't explain how, but all of this energy, all this adrenaline started flowing in him. And he said he was like a mountain goat. He was like going down the ledge. He jumped. He was able to kind of get down to another ledge. He got out of it and for the next 20 years it was haunted by, how did that happen? I want that feeling again because it was actually the most ecstatic feeling I had, energy that I never suspected in myself. And so he tries everything to get that feeling back. He tries climbing other mountains, he tries going to Mount Everest and it doesn't come back. And finally he kind of figures out the formula for it and why it happened. He studies a lot of neuroscience. It's a great book. I'm using it in my new book. It's called Bone Games. It's a very interesting book, a lot of science in it. And he got the feeling back in a smaller sense of, but it was the feeling of, your life is in danger, I better get my act together or it's the end. And suddenly adrenaline, dopamine, all the other things were occurring in him and he got. And he found that energy. So that's the ultimate kind of death ground right there."

So now I have to say, as I said before, I'm so grateful that your stroke didn't take you out because clearly there's still so much in there and you're continuing to share what is really exquisitely useful knowledge. Oh, thank you. It's just kind of astonishing to me. I started off today's discussion expressing my gratitude for what you've already done for my life and for the lives of so many other people. Through your books, it's clear you've been on a foraging exploration and that foraging for organizing and communicating information mainly in the form of written books, but also online content. You have a terrific YouTube channel which I subscribe to and follow and listen to with rapt attention. And the other venues with which you share information, including this one today, are really, truly valuable and appreciated. So I want to say, on behalf of myself and for those that have known you and your work for a number of years, but also for the many people that are now sure to know who you are and what you're about, that it's just so clear that this stuff comes from the heart and that whatever early seed planted this, you know, that we're all grateful for and better off as a consequence of that seed. So I could make this list very, very long with the number of specific ways in which you've improved the journey through life and made it clearer. I mean, life is certainly can be hard, but it also can be really confusing. And I feel that the Robert Greene roadmap, even though it's but one roadmap, is an extremely valuable map to have and to use, certainly has been for me. So just an enormous thank you, Robert. Thanks for sharing today and thanks for all you do and all that you're still doing and sure to do in the future."

I do read all the comments, not on today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discussed supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving sleep, for hormone support, and for focus. To see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to livemomentous, spelled O U S. So that's Livemomentous.com. huberman, if you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. So that's Instagram, X threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook. And on all those platforms I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content on the Huberman Lab podcast. Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
