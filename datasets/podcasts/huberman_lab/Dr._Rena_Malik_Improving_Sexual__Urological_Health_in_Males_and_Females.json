        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is doctor Reena Malik. Doctor Reena Malik is a board certified urologist and pelvic surgeon. She is an expert in both male and female urological, pelvic floor and sexual health. During today's episode, Doctor Malik answers the most commonly asked questions about urinary pelvic and sexual health, for instance, how to avoid getting utis, urinary tract infections. We also discuss pelvic floor anatomy and function as it relates to overcoming an overly tight or an overly relaxed pelvic floor. This is a key distinction that most people aren't aware of. Many people hear about the need to so called strengthen their pelvic floor, but in fact, many people need to do the exact opposite. They need to learn to relax their pelvic floor in order to achieve proper urologic and sexual function. So today you'll learn about that. You will also learn about sexual health as it relates to erectile function, as it relates to things like vaginal lubrication as it relates to orgasm. We separate out very carefully the difference between psychological desire and arousal that occurs within the genitals themselves. And Doctor Malik highlights some important misconceptions about sexual dysfunction. For instance, that many people believe that hormones are responsible for sexual dysfunction, but in reality, hormone dysregulation is responsible for only a very small percentage of sexual dysfunction. And yet, pelvic floor and blood flow related issues can account for a large number of cases of sexual dysfunction in both males and females. So I assure you that today's discussion is going to illuminate many new areas of information, many new tools and protocols that I'm guessing most people have not heard of. We talk about the neurovascular, that is, blood flow related and muscular aspects of bladder function, prostate function, skenes glands. We talk about vaginal health as well as penile health. We talk about these things as it relates to different stages across the lifespan. It is a far reaching and in depth and practical conversation that I'm certain everyone will glean important takeaways from now. Before we go any further, I do want to highlight that the content of today's episode is sexual in nature. We talk very directly about different types of sexual behavior, and we talk about it from the standpoint of the clinician and biologist. So it is a medical scientific discussion. That said, we can't be aware of where this podcast is being played and who is listening. And I assert that there are certain themes within today's discussion that would not be suitable for young children. How young? Well, that is certainly not for us to discern. We realize that different parents and different households should be the arbiters of what sorts of information their children are exposed to or not. So my suggestion would be that if you have any concern whatsoever that the content of today's episode would not be appropriate to be heard by some member of your family, that you please listen to the podcast first, or at least check the timestamps where we've detailed what specific topics are covered, and then to make your decision accordingly. I should mention that not only is Doctor Malik still an active clinician, she sees patients daily out of her clinic in southern California, and we provided a link to that clinic in the show Note captions she's also authored dozens of high quality, peer reviewed publications in the fields of urology, pelvic health, and sexual health, and we've also provided a link to that bibliography in the show. Note captions and she is also a spectacular public educator. She provides zero cost content about sexual health, pelvic floor health, and urology as it relates to both men and women on her YouTube channel. And there too, we've provided a link to Doctor Malik's YouTube channel in the show Note captions to this episode before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium. The so called electrolytes and no sugar, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios, and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelement lmnt.com Huberman Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, NidRa sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because some sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with doctor Reena Malik. Doctor Reena Malik, welcome."

I find that you are able to deliver critical information about sexual health, urology, pelvic floor libido and so many other things that are of immense interest to people, but that ordinarily, people don't really know where to get the high quality information, and coming to you for that information means they are going to get the highest quality information. I truly believe that because, as everyone will soon hear today, we're going to have a very frank discussion, but one that's really grounded in science and medicine, around sexual health and related topics. These are topics that typically people learn about, perhaps a little bit in school, maybe at home, from friends, usually overhearing things, as opposed to direct exploratory conversation, online pornography. And at least in my experience growing up, there was education around sexual health, reproductive health, et cetera, that was more oriented toward the fear of things like STI's fear of unwanted pregnancy. All of which, of course, is extremely important for people to learn about, but far less about sort of the healthy versions of sexual health. Right?"

It's also one that I think has a backdrop that we should just acknowledge right off the bat, that because the information is gleaned from multiple sources and because there are, let's just say, influences out there that relate to the morality of different practices, that there can be shame, there can be misunderstanding, there can be secrecy, and that further leads to misinformation. So I'm confident that today you can clarify things for us, and we're going to stay out of those trenches. And the last thing I'd like to say is that because a number of terms will certainly come up that I think for some people, they're not used to hearing in general discourse. I'm just going to get them out of the way now. Penis, vagina, anus, prostate, you know, what else is there? We're going to talk about libido. We're going to talk about intercourse, oral sex, anal sex. We're going to talk about all of that. So I just want to get that out there so that we can reduce the shock response."

        "text": "Great. So to start things off, in anticipation of this episode, I solicited for questions on social media, and I got thousands of questions, but there was a lot of overlap in the questions. So to start off, I'd like to talk about pelvic floor, because both males and females have a pelvic floor. And my understanding is that there's a muscular component, there's a neuromuscular component, there's a blood flow component. What is a healthy pelvic floor. What does a healthy pelvic floor do? And then we can talk about some of the health issues that an unhealthy pelvic floor creates and some of the ways to ameliorate an unhealthy pelvic floor."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Absolutely. So a pelvic floor, very simply, is basically a bowl of muscles that's connected to bones that hold up all your organs. So, basically, in your pelvis, there's all these muscles there, and their function is essentially many. It helps with urination, defecation, sexual function. It helps with posture. And so having a strong, healthy pelvic floor can mean that you're having normal urination, you're having normal defecation, you're having great sex, and that you are also not having ailments like back pain or issues related to those functions and those organs. Pelvic floor is so important in so many different aspects, and we deal with it a lot as urologists because it's so integral to these functions that we take care of. When you have an unhealthy pelvic floor, it can vary from person to person. And while you hear about it a lot in women, men also suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction or problems with the pelvic floor. So, basically, pelvic floor dysfunction happens a lot when you're doing things like, if you were to go to the gym and do repetitions of any sort of exercise and you didn't rest, then that muscle would become contracted and short. Very similarly, if your pelvic floor is overstrained, it can become contracted and short and tight all the time. And you may not know it. It may just be a function of stress, anxiety, or overuse or posture problems, things of that nature that can affect your pelvic floor. And so this can lead to issues. Let's start with urination. You can have symptoms of urgency, frequency, meaning you have to go a lot to the bathroom, or you have to go and have a sudden desire that you can't delay, sometimes even have leakage. In some cases, it can make it difficult to urinate because the pelvic floor."

        "text": "Something of that sort."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, it can be either that you're not emptying completely or that the pelvic floor muscles are so tense that they're stimulating the bladder. So it feels like there's more to go so it's not always that you're not evacuating. It can present in a number of different ways. And then with sexual function, if it's very tense, you can have pain. So you can have pain with sex, you can have pain with erections, you can have pain with ejaculation. Sometimes it can be a lot of different kind of pain syndromes. And you're like, I have all these different things going on, and it's really just pelvic floor dysfunction. With GI function, you can definitely have constipation, and then often you can also have back pain. And so all of these things can happen when your pelvic floor is too tense. Sometimes your pelvic floor can be too weak, and that can be often because of, we see this in women a lot because of childbirth, delivering children with some people who have neurologic disorders, they can have weak pelvic floors or connective tissue disorders like Ehlers Danlos syndrome, for example. These sorts of things can cause weakness to the pelvic floor, which can then cause, very often what I see is, like, urinary incontinence or leakage, which can then create problems for people down the line."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Thank you for that. So first question, how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight from a over contraction or chronic contraction of the muscles there versus too weak? And one of the challenges in having this conversation is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bicep, I think everyone intuitively knows because they've seen the shortening of the muscle is when the muscle is quote unquote flexed, and the lengthening of the muscles when it is relaxed. Is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening in a way that everyone can understand? Would this be, like I said, we're going to be direct today. Would this be tensing up one's anus, the opposite of the movement that one would do before initiating a bowel movement? And relaxation is sort of the pattern of pelvic floor muscular relaxation just prior to initiating a bowel movement."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So I will say most people can't recognize it because it's very difficult to notice. It's sort of gradual, and so it can, over time, become noticeable with these symptoms. But otherwise, it's very difficult because it's not a muscle that we were ever trained to recognize. Right. Like, you hear about Kegel exercises, for example, and people talk about how to do them, but that's all you ever hear about the pelvic floor. And so you don't really know how to do things in a way that protects your pelvic floor or how to even tell when it's too tight or not relaxing. And so that takes sort of a training. And so usually when people come to first, you get an examination to see if your pelvic floor is tight. So for women, it's a pelvic exam, and for men, it's usually a rectal exam."

    {
        "speaker": "B",

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So digital palpation, that's a medical technology for fingers are called digits. So I'm old enough to recognize what a digital prostate exam is. Right. The physician inserts their fingers through into the anus and feels the prostate to see whether or not it's swollen or not. And as I'm saying this, I'm realizing, you know, sometimes we think of medicine, quote unquote, modern medicine, as so evolved. This has basically, basically been the practice for, what, 50 years, 60 years, maybe a hundred years, in the same way that the old school practice for glaucoma, excessive eye pressure, was for the physician to just touch the eyeball. So, folks, for those of you that think that medicine has evolved much, it clearly has in many ways. But in any event, so a prostate exam goes as I just described. What would a pelvic floor exam for a male and a pelvic floor exam for a female involve at a kind of granular level here?"

    {
        "speaker": "B",

        "text": "Correct. And you could, too. You could put your finger in, but you don't have a reference of normal, right? So you wouldn't know what a normal pelvic floor feels like versus a tight one versus a weak one. And so you can assess the tenseness based on palpation. You can also see if there's tenderness. And so you can assess that based on just a general physical examination. And then also you can observe. So I can say, contract your, squeeze your pelvic floor up and in. I can look and see, are they squeezing or are they pushing? Are they coordinated or not? Right. Because that's a function of normal use of the pelvic floor. And sometimes you'll see that they're discoordinated. You can also assess for sensation in the area and things like that. That could be consequences of dysfunction."

They work with you on a prolonged basis to help you normalize the function of your pelvic floor. It's like going to the gym with a trainer. They really work with you to get your pelvic floor functioning correctly. And the first step to that, a lot of pelvic floor therapists will just align your bones and the way you sit and walk to make sure that you're not straining those muscles by pulling in different directions."

    {
        "speaker": "B",

What it is, what we describe it to for patients is we say you're going to, there's a few different ways to describe it. You're going to use the muscles that you use when you urinate but try to stop the flow, but you don't want to do them when you're urinating because that can create dysfunction. You want to learn what the muscles are and then you squeeze those muscles and relax in between sets, so to speak. And so you'll do, the other way people describe it is pulling up and in like the vagina or for men, sometimes you'll say it's like the feeling that you're trying to lift your penis off the floor without touching it. So those are kind of you."

And so you can squeeze for 5 seconds and relax for 5 seconds and do them in repetitions and they're just like any sort of exercise you do. You don't want to start doing 100 of them, right? You want to do them. I tell them, people, I tell patients, do them lying down so that you're only focusing on those muscles. You're not working on your posture, you're not doing anything else. And as you get better with them lying down, you then sit up and do them. And then once you're good with them sitting up, you can do them standing and start with ten to 15 at a time."

But don't overdo it, because just like anything, especially when you're starting out, you can. And if you're doing tons and tons of kegels, then you will get a tight, short pelvic floor muscles and you will then develop pelvic floor dysfunction. So it's really important to kind of understand those mechanics, which is why a lot of people think they know how to do kegels, but they really don't. And so I always encourage people, if you have the time and the resources to go to a pelvic floor physical therapist so they can really work with you and make sure you're doing them correctly."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yes. So they are typically prescribed for urinary incontinence, specifically stress urinary incontinence. So leakage that occurs when you have an increase in your intra abdominal pressure like a valsalva or coughing, sneezing, lifting heavy things, jumping on a trampoline. So for those purposes, we use kegels to strengthen the pelvic floor. And also in women, pelvic organ prolapse. So when you have weakness of the pelvic floor, that leads to a bulge that you can visibly see or feel in the vagina. For men, we often prescribe them for people who have had a prostatectomy, who then subsequently develop leakage after the prostatectomy, that is, again, stress, urinary incontinence. Now, a lot of people use Kegels recreationally because improving the pelvic floor musculature can lead to more intense pelvic floor contractions during orgasm, which can be more pleasurable. Some people do it for those purposes, but again, I caution people not to overdo it, because then you can lead to a more tense pelvic floor, which is not where we want to end up."

I only heard good things about kegels, and what it quickly resulted in was painful urination. And I thought, this is weird. Everyone's saying kegels are so great.

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It can be. It can be if you overtrain it, just like if you over treat anything else. And so you just have to, if you really want to do kegels, if you have any symptoms at all, like you described, painful urination or the things I've described, like pain with erections, pain with ejaculation, pain difficulty emptying any of those symptoms, stop and go see a urologist so that they can kind of assess your pelvic floor."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So there's a lot of different sort of things that you can do. So for women, you can do massage of the area. You can use vaginal dilators to help relax the muscles. You can take suppositories that have medications like valium or baclofen, which are muscle relaxants, and that can help as well. Although they're not treatments, they're more of a band aid, but they can help with the symptoms that you're having, and then you can also. I think the best thing is to work with the physical therapist, because they can teach you certain exercises that will help down train the pelvic floor. For example, one of the ones I tell my patients is like, happy baby pose. It actually stretches and elongates the pelvic floor muscles. So doing these exercises regularly will help you lengthen the pelvic floor muscles."

I would go to these yoga classes at one point in my life, and they'd have everybody do these crunches. And I've always done some abdominal work here and there during the week if I'm being diligent. But they would have us cross our feet, and that seemed to lead to some pelvic floor discomfort that was similar to what I had experienced when I did the kegels. So, again, for me, ceasing the kegels was one of the best decisions I ever made. I only did them for a short while. I was like, okay, this is clearly not for me. And I guess that's another point that tell me if you agree or not that if you hear about something online or on this podcast or anywhere else, and you try it, and it seems to be sending things in the wrong direction, either you're doing it wrong, or it might not be the right thing for you."

But is there anything about the anatomy of the neuromuscular connections or vasculature of the pelvic floor that would provide support for my experience there? That doing crunches with legs crossed is essentially, is it possible that it's creating asymmetries in the pelvic floor? And now I'm sure I'm angering yoga teachers and crunch Anistas everywhere. You know, hey, if it's a question of your pelvic floor or a few extra delineations in your abs. You know where my vote's going."

        "text": "So there's a couple things here that we should dive into. One is that people don't often breathe correctly during exercise, right. And so diaphragmatic breathing is really important, which is like a deep breath that expands the diaphragm, not kind of shallow breathing, but just in your mouth and throat. And that is actually when you, you know, when you do any sort of exercise, your trainer will tell you, exhale on the effort. Right. And there's a reason for that, because when you inhale, your pelvic floor relaxes. When you exhale, your pelvic floor contracts. And so it actually, that contraction stabilizes the pelvic floor. So whatever intra abdominal pressure you're causing to increase from the exercise, whether it's a squat or a crunch or whatever, you're increasing your abdominal pressure. Your pelvic floor is then contracting to help stabilize that. Part of the reason people tend to hold their breath during crunches, they don't do the appropriate breathing. And so that can be part of it. The other thing that can happen with certain things is that there are nerves and arteries, particularly the pudendal nerve and the pudendal artery, that run through the pelvic floor. So when you get pelvic floor dysfunction, you can cause decreased blood flow to the pelvic floor muscles, which can affect sexual function. And you can get nerve inflammation as well, that can also cause pain. And so this is kind of how it all comes together."

        "text": "I'm so glad that you mentioned blood flow. I think our entire discussion today should be framed up, at least in the back of our minds and the minds of our listeners and viewers as involving at least three things. Anytime we're talking about erectile function or dysfunction or pelvic floor function or dysfunction or vaginal lubrication or lack thereof, we need to think about the hormonal influences, the blood flow related influences, and the neural influences, including the neural influences that come from the brain, the signals of arousal, for instance, or lack of arousal, and so on. So we won't be overly systematic in our parsing of all this, but I think what you just mentioned raises a really important point, that sometimes in an effort to do something that's good for the muscles, like strengthen the muscles, one will cut off blood flow. In fact, one of the more common questions I got, and I consulted with a couple of exercise physiologists about this, and they confirmed that a lot of people who squat and deadlift heavy in the gym or even who just tense their pelvic floor when they're doing things like dumbbell curls or other exercises. And especially people who seem to do a lot of abdominal work reported to me in the questions that they experienced things like erectile dysfunction, that they experienced things like pain during vaginal intercourse, that essentially they had created some sort of what sounds to me like a hyper contraction of the muscles in that area that were impeding all the things that they wanted as either side effects or direct effects of exercise, because many people are exercising for aesthetic reasons and health reasons, but nowadays it seems especially on the male side. But we'll also talk about the role of testosterone on the female side. A lot of males lift weights in order to increase their testosterone and for reasons that are obvious, also want to have healthy sexual function. And here they are doing this thing that's very good for increasing testosterone if they're doing it correctly. And testosterone is involved in libido and the male sexual response, and the female sexual response, of course, but they are impeding their erections. So you can start to see how there are probably a lot of confused and maybe even distraught people out there. They're trying to do all the right things and they're setting up roadblocks and even sending themselves backward in some cases. So the question is, how does one know whether or not something like, let's say, low lubrication or pain during vaginal intercourse or loss of erectile strengthen or some sort of erectile dysfunction, whatever it may be, because it can take on different forms. As we'll talk about, how does one know if it's blood flow related, hormone related or neural related? And if it's neural related, how does one know if it's an issue of lack of appropriate signals from the brain over suppression or lack of arousal from the brain, or whether or not it's some peripheral neural thing of innervation of the penis or vagina?"

        "text": "I believe so. You know, you maybe get the sex flush, right? You get some redness or warmth feeling. That's your body's response to arousal. And sometimes that can be an erection, and sometimes that's not. Not having an erection does not mean you're not aroused. It may mean other things, but certainly that's part of it. And then desire. Do you want to have sex? Do you have, like, when you think about your partner or whoever you want to engage with, is there a desire to actually do that? Right? Or is it just more of obligation or other things? And it doesn't matter if the desire comes after arousal. For some women in particular, we see that they may not have the desire right away, but they want to be intimate or close with their partner, and so they'll start just being close with them, and then arousal will come. And then, oh, yeah, I like this. So then the comes after, and that's normal. That's totally fine. So you want to kind of parse that out. And then for men, you can ask, are you getting erections at night? Because that will tell us the function of your organ at night versus during the day, where you have also psychogenic components. Right. You can really get in your head about erections when you have a problem in the bedroom. With performance, it becomes a vicious cycle. Right. You have a problem the next time you're really stressed, you're not present, you're not mindful in the moment with sex, and you're thinking about, oh, my God, am I gonna perform okay? Am I gonna perform okay? And then it doesn't perform again, and you're just. It's getting worse and worse, and the anxiety is through the roof, and that's actually causing your sexual dysfunction. So I think it's important first to identify those issues and then also for blood flow. A lot of times we can assess based on, well, what other comorbidities do you have. Do you have other issues ongoing that may be affecting your blood flow? Most common, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease. And if you smoke, all of those things will affect blood flow to the genitals. And so that will point out negatively, negatively? Negatively. So that will point us to a more vascular issue. Hormonal issues are very important for desire. And as far as sexual function, in terms of erections, there's only 3% of erectile dysfunction that's related to hormones. So it's. Absolutely."

In fact, a lot of people don't know this, but women have more testosterone in their bodies than they actually have estrogen. So testosterone is very important for both men and women for a variety of reasons. Using that discussion with the patient will help you identify where you're headed in terms of what you need to focus on for treatment. There are certain things you can use to assess blood flow. You can do doppler ultrasounds of the penis as well as the clitoris to see if there is good blood flow. You can assess the peak systolic velocity, which will tell you if there's a problem with arterial inflow, versus the end diastolic velocity, which will tell you if there's a problem with venous outflow. And so that can assess those things. Some tests you can do for nerve function, although they're very uncommonly done, because mostly we can kind of get that through clinical report. And unfortunately, if you're having nerve problems, sometimes it depends on what's causing them, but sometimes they can be very difficult to reverse, and that's kind of a problem. We know that as people age, their sensation becomes less so just through aging, the nerves, the receptors become less sensitive, and so you will generally have less responsiveness to the same sensations you did when you were younger. And so that kind of overlays all of this. So it's complex, but really a lot of it comes from the discussion you have with your patient or you kind of really doing a deep dive in what's going on, really thinking about each of those aspects, and also what's going on in your relationship and what's going on in your life. Stress, anxiety. How are those playing a role?"

I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com hubermanda. They'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D. Three k, two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com Huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D. Three k, two. Gosh, lots there to unpack. And I'm glad you mentioned the relationship itself, because there are all sorts of things that can impact the arousal response, novelty. Not everyone's in a committed relationship. Whether or not people are engaging in a lot of masturbation to the point of ejaculation or climax or not, pornography, et cetera, we will get into that. It's a vast space to explore. Before we go any further, I want to make sure, however, that we cue people to where and how they could find a really good, let's say, pelvic floor therapist and where they could find a really great urologist to do the sorts of exams and perhaps the sorts of treatments that we've talked about. Because at least as far as I understand, much of what people want to learn on this podcast is how things work and what happens when things break down, but also how to resolve those issues. So let's say somebody wants to check out their pelvic floor, figure out what's going on there. Maybe they're having issues, maybe they're not. If they are male or female, where do they go? Is there a place online that has a great list of some of the best ones in one's area? Can it be done over telemedicine? Yeah. How does one go about that?"

Now that could be a urologist, that could be a gynecologist or even a physical medicine rehabilitation doctor, specializes in pelvic floor health. So typically you'll see in urology, you'll look for people who are board certified in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. If you're a woman, if you're a man, maybe sexual medicine, someone who specializes in sexual medicine, would be a good place to look for a gynecologist. Again, you want to look at someone who has interest in this area, who does manage pelvic floor. And then in terms of pelvic floor physical medicine rehabilitation, at least when I was in training, there was about 20 PMR doctors around the country who really focused on this. It's not a lot of people. If you can go to a pelvic floor physical therapist and you have one near you, that's great as well. You do want to make sure that one they do are certified in pelvic floor physical therapy and that they have taken care of your gender. So if you have male anatomy, then you want to go to someone who's actually seen men, because a lot of the pelvic floor physical therapists tend to treat a lot of women. And so that's kind of what I tell my patients, generally speaking. There's no, at least to my knowledge, no great resource. And maybe we'll look that up and see if we can find a."

Because again, going back to what I said at the beginning of our conversation, I think there's a lot of shame, or at least a lack of clarity as to how one gets help for issues that relate to the genitals. Because if you have a headache or you're having an eye issue, sort of nowhere to go. Hopefully your headache doesn't warrant going to a neurologist. But it might. Eye stuff tends to be ophthalmologists, optometrists. So I don't think we hear often enough about where to access the best quality care for these things. So thank you for that. In thinking about sexual dysfunction, I'd like to have that conversation more or less in parallel, if we can, around male sexual dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. And I want to make sure that before we do that, that I'm creating the correct parallel construction. As they say, erectile dysfunction in males is clearly a form of sexual dysfunction. What is the parallel to erectile dysfunction in females? Is it lack of vaginal lubrication and lack of relaxation of the vagina to have non painful intercourse? Is it even possible to have a parallel conversation about these two things?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So it's different in some circumstances. There are homologues, so the penis is the homologue of the clitoris, so the clitoris is essentially the same sort of spongy erectile tissue that you see in the penis. It gets erect with arousal, and it actually extends very deep into the pelvis. So it's not just a small little organ. It's actually quite long. And so you can. In men, you can have erectile dysfunction because you can see it, but in women, you may have difficulty with orgasm. And it's not exactly a parallel, but difficulty orgasming in women is multifactorial, and we can get into that. But I think there, they're different. And I think also sexual dysfunction presents differently in both genders. So when you talk about men, they're very. The one visual they see of arousal is erections. And so it becomes very ingrained in your psyche that if I don't have an erection, I'm not aroused. Right. But there's a lot of reasons that you might not have an erection. That we've sort of touched on vascular problems, hormonal problems, neurologic problems, psychogenic issues, and other medications you're taking. There are issues that can affect erectile function. And so that can be part of it where you might feel like you have low desire because your arousal is not there. And that becomes a little bit confusing for women. What they can assess is their level of lubrication if sex hurts and if they get an orgasm. And so those are kind of the ways you can look at it."

        "text": "Thank you for fleshing all of that out. Years ago, I worked on sexual differentiation and in particular, the role of hormones in sexual differentiation. And indeed, as you described, we learned because we were taught, and I think people still generally agree, that if one looks at the embryological origins of the penis and the clitoris, they are essentially analogous structures. And that a lot of male genital development involves, literally the regression, the disappearance of the female sexual genitalia and associated organs, mullerian ducts and things like that, and what would become the ovaries become the testes, et cetera, et cetera. Those are anatomical parallels. But what you just described for us very beautifully is the sort of functional parallels as it relates to sexual function and dysfunction. So I'm hoping with that framing that we can knock down a few of these pins in a little less time, because there's a lot to tackle here. First off, I'd like to address the hormonal issues. You mentioned that only 3% of erectile dysfunction, and by extension, can we say, also female issues with sexual arousal, are hormonal in origin. Is that right?"

It's a small percentage of the entirety of erectile dysfunction."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. So I think in looking on the landscape of social media and podcasts and just in the common mindset, we've all come to believe that testosterone is pro libido. It's pro desire in men and women. I think now people are starting to appreciate that it's pro desire in women as well, but certainly in men, and that dopamine is also associated with desiree. And the general public tends to have this view of estrogen as being sort of anti libido or anti male, which is frankly false. In fact, and I've covered this on the podcast with Doctor Kyle Gillette and with Doctor Peter Attia and another fellow youtuber, Derek from more plates, more dates, has talked a lot about the fact that if people, if men, excuse me, take drugs like anastrozole to suppress their estrogen, thinking that, oh, it's all about having high testosterone, low estrogen, oftentimes they crush their libido, just abolish it, which has led to a slowly growing, but I think, positive shift in how people are thinking about estrogen. Estrogen is great for brain function. Estrogen's great for libido in men and women. Correct. And that is a revision of, I think, how most people think of the male sexual response. It's more in keeping with how people think about the female sexual response. Oh, estrogen in the female sexual response. That makes sense. But what we're trying to do here is clarify some of the misconceptions. Now, the reason I mentioned dopamine is that my understanding is that dopamine is involved in the, excuse me, the desire response. We will distinguish desire, the psychological arousal, from genital arousal, physical arousal, and that prolactin is associated with the refractory period during which erection can't occur. Another, perhaps, orgasm can't occur in females, et cetera. But my understanding is that's also not that simple. And we need to take a step back, perhaps, and just talk about the physiological underpinnings of the desire and arousal response. So I'll tell you what I was taught, and then you can tell me where it's wrong, I hope. I was taught that the erection response and the vaginal lubrication response is generated by the parasympathetic nervous system, the relaxed, the rest and digest aspect of the nervous system. Hence why some people can get psychogenic sexual issues of lack of erection or lack of vaginal lubrication. But that there are individuals out there for whom a lot of alertness, maybe even, and this is a controversial thing, but for some people, even some sense of aggression or kind of edginess or excitement, adrenaline, in other words, can stimulate erection or vaginal lubrication. So it gets tricky. It's not like the textbooks. It's not like they taught us in high school, as far as I know. I was taught that the arousal response in males and females is initiated by a parasympathetic sort of relaxed tone. And that as sexual desire and arousal and sex or masturbation progresses, that it shifts more towards the sympathetic nervous system, which has nothing to do with emotional sympathy and has everything to do with arousal. The catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, are released. And that the climax response, which may or may not include ejaculation, we have to separate that out, is one that is really of the stress system of the body. And then in the post coital or post ejaculatory or post climax phase, then there's a shift back to the parasympathetic nervous system. That's where the pillow talk and the exchange of odors and tastes and other molecules is known to enhance pair bonding through things like oxytocin, vasopressin and so on. And what I just described is exceedingly oversimplified, I realize. But is that more or less how the physiology works?"

A visual stimulus, a tactile stimulus, some sort of stimulus that you're getting that is then causing the release of nitric oxide from the parasympathetic nervous system.

Basically what happens, let's actually, let's take it back to the nitric oxide thing and we'll get there. So nitric oxide essentially is released by the endothelium in response to a visual tactile stimulant stimulating cue. Right? And so your body releases nitric oxide side, which then sets off the cascade for the erection. And so that releases cgmp, which is, which causes the erection, and it's degraded by phosphodiesterase. And so medications that inhibit phosphodiesterase, like Viagra and cialis, tend to prevent the breakdown of that cgmp, so you have longer lasting erections. And so similarly these medications work sort of similar to that. Some of them, we don't know exactly how they work, but they work by increased increasing cgmp or camp that are involved in those cascades."

So we know that about 50% of 52% of men over the age of 40 will have erectile dysfunction. And that continues to increase as you age. So 50% of 50 year olds, 60% of 60 year olds, and so on and so forth. So it's very, very common. And the success rate in the studies is about 60% to 70%. So when you give someone a medication, they will have sustained erections that are sufficient for penetrative intercourse, which is the way we kind of discuss erectile dysfunction in studies and with patients is about 60% to 70%. So not everyone will have success. But not all of that is because the medication doesn't work. Sometimes people are not taking them correctly. Sometimes people need to try different doses. And then there's still this issue of your brain is still active, and so if you're having anxiety or having other issues or stress in your life, that can have an effect on your ability to create an erection. So there's lots of factors that go into it, but generally speaking, they are effective and they do work quite well and they're tolerated pretty well."

What we're talking about here is daily use of 2.5 to five milligrams of cialis tidal fl for prostate health. And I learned in researching for this episode that tadalafil cialis was actually developed as a drug for the treatment of prostate health, to essentially increase blood flow of the prostate, to increase prostate health, not for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. So I found that to be somewhat interesting, and a lot of people are now starting to use that. I also learned that if you dive into the guts of the Internet, one can find that now there's a growing use of combined low dosage cialis and apomorphine, which is a pro dopaminergic agent.

So some people have kind of thought, okay, it's increasing blood flow, it's preventing fibrosis of that erectile tissue. That can happen with age or other vascular problems. So it may be beneficial for that as well. Although again, that's off label and not something that we generally promote. As far as for women, there's again, it can help with blood flow. So if you're having issues. So if you have a female who's having sexual dysfunction and she's got a signs of vascular problems, like she's got diabetes, high blood pressure, she smokes, and yes, it's certainly reasonable to try and see how they do.

Because everything you said up until now was mainly focused on men 40 years and older. Is it from lack of physical activity, overuse of nicotine? By the way, vaping, as far as we know, vaping and smoking, bad for erectile function and perhaps sexual health in males and females generally. Because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor. Nicotine does have certain benefits, and I covered this in an episode on nicotine. Neurocognitive benefits in the elderly in particular. But it is a vasoconstrictor, so it runs against all of the sexual arousal stuff that we're talking about. But okay, let's assume that a male in their twenties or thirties is sleeping enough six to 8 hours a night, is exercising, isn't doing anything to punish their pelvic floor in the gym, they're not doing legs crossed kegels while doing crunches or something while inhaling on the crunch. That was a quiz, by the way, folks, for earlier topics covered, let's assume they're eating pretty well. The majority of their foods are coming from non processed or minimally processed foods. They're doing a little meditation each day. They're engaging in hopefully healthy relationships, they're not masturbating like crazy to porn. And let's assume that they are, you know, not on any SSRI. Why are all these 2030 year olds on the Internet asking mainly you?

But a lot of us are sitting long periods of time, especially during COVID I mean, people sat for months, right, years, like, just sitting at their home computer.

You hear more often than you do in areas where people are living further apart. You hear people having sex. Yeah, it's part. It's part of the. Part of the auditory landscape."

But I will say that you can get habituated to certain things, and there is that data that maybe you can get habituated to watching a certain type of thing to get aroused. And then normal things do not get you aroused. Right. Like, you may watch pornography and then you may have difficulty getting aroused or turned on when you see your partner. You may get used to masturbating a certain way. Right. So if you use certain vibratory stimulation or certain pressure sensation every single time you masturbate, you can get habituated to that, and you may not be able to replicate that during penetrative intercourse. And so I think that's really important. And I think the take home is to try and vary what you're doing. Masturbation is find healthy way of self exploration. Again, with the caveat that as long as you're not masturbating to excess and avoiding your obligations or your family or your partners or your friends, right, like, you are just masturbating for the benefits of maybe sleep improvement, mood boosting, reduction in anxiety, those things are great.

Again, we're talking about going through the conversations and the mating ritual. That is the human mating ritual, that, of course, in the context of healthy interactions, involves getting mutual consent and these kinds of things that you could imagine how, without placing any moral judgment on it, without shaming anybody, you could imagine that if somebody exclusively masturbated and didn't develop the skills of courtship and building healthy sexual relationships, that pornography and or masturbation could start to create, quote unquote problems, right.

And then you go to sort. And that can last a variety of different times. You'll also start seeing some lubrication vaginally. Right. And then the plateau response is when that is kind of at its peak and it kind of stays steady, and then you reach orgasm. And so orgasm, essentially is a response of the body where you will have, again, increased sympathetic response, and you will have pelvic floor muscle contractions, which are rhythmic, about 0.8 seconds or so. You're having a rhythmic pelvic floor contraction along with the sensation of orgasm. And then you'll have your recovery period, which you talked about briefly earlier, which can have sort of a refractory time period, at which point you can no longer orgasm again, if you'd like to, or for men, obtain another erection again for a short period of time.

Not just heterosexual, but a novel sexual partner, female or male, depending on their proclivities, can override the refractory period, and they can have another erection and ejaculation. Similarly, a female will have a post orgasmic refractory period. If they're given an adequate stimulus, something arousing enough, they can experience arousal and orgasm again. And we know, based on really good pharmacology, that this is a dopamine driven thing. The prolactin is essentially establishing the refractory period, and the dopamine is essentially overriding the refractory period. Fascinating neurochemistry there.

The other medication that's available for low libido is called flobanserin, also known as Addie is the brand name. And that also works on serotonin. It's got kind of a mixed response, serotonin and dopaminergic areas of the brain, and essentially works as a daily medication taken before bedtime, 100 milligrams a day. That actually helps with decreasing hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Works in about 45% to 60% of patients, and you need to take it for some time. Now, both of these are brand name medications, so they are a little bit costly and sometimes insurance doesn't cover them, but they are available and I think very few people know about them, and I think they're really great and useful tools in the toolbox."

Anytime we talk about arousal and libido, there's no BMI, which, by the way, the body mass index is probably not the best tool either. But there's no chart. It's not like a thermometer that says you're 98.6 plus or minus two degrees, you're good. If it's too high, much higher than that, you have a fever. If much lower than that, you're hypothermic. So my understanding, my. I don't wanna say naive understanding, but my understanding is that one determines whether or not their libido is normal, high or low, largely based on some intuitive understanding of what their partner or partner's desire, whether or not they can meet those desires, and if they sort of accrue enough of a sample size, they date enough people where they have sexual interactions, they figure out over time whether or not they have a low, medium or high sex drive. And people tend to compare to how they felt in earlier years or at different times of the year under different psychological conditions and stress conditions, that kind of thing. But we really don't have a benchmark for this. Right? I mean, we can't say that, for instance, that if I. People are not desiring sex or thinking about sex with blank frequency, that they have low libido. Right. It's sort of what is working or not working for you in the context of your life."

So when we look at studies for female sexual dysfunction, you can, using like, validated questionnaires like the FSFI, you can actually see that about 40% of people qualify for having sexual dysfunction. But really bother is only seen at about 12%. And you can be bothered because you're bothered, you can be bothered because your partner is bothered, but it's really up to you. Right? Like, if you feel like there's something that you want to improve on, then that's when you go see your doctor. But there's no right or wrong answer. Right? This is very subjective, and a lot of times we'll see couples who have mismatched libidos. Now, does that mean one person's right and one person is wrong?

And this is not just put on males, this is put on females. I hope she doesn't kill me for saying this. I know somebody who is a family member who once said, sometimes you have to realize you never want to sleep with somebody again by sleeping with them. And here we're not talking about traumatic experience. Right, right. So, you know, again, the discussion around libido, as you so aptly pointed out, engaging what is healthy levels of libido has a lot to do with what oneself desires, as well as the hopes and expectations of the people that we are sexually involved with. So we'll get back to that a little bit later in the context of chemistry because I find it so fascinating and it's something that isn't talked about enough. But thank you for that.

What it does is the cervix moves up and out of the way, the inner one third, two, three of the vagina lengthens and elongates to allow for penetration, and it can actually nearly double in size of the baseline vaginal length. And so it is preparing for that. And so that's part of it. In some people who have painful intercourse, it's because they haven't had adequate time for arousal. And so there the penis is penetrating before they've had those adaptations to occur. And also the labia open up to allow for that penetration. So these things actually happen physiologically to allow for preparation. So while some people may be aroused and get to that point quicker, some people do need a longer period of time of what, as you described, foreplay. And not everyone is the same, but I think it's important to have that discussion with your partner. And, you know, lubrication is one of the ways that people assess arousal, but that's not the be all, end all. Some people just make a lot of lubrication, and some people don't. And certainly that changes with age and hormones. So if. Certainly we know that after menopause, with a drop in estrogen and testosterone, you will see a decrease in lubrication. And sometimes, if people are on medications that can alter their hormonal axis, they may also see changes in lubrication. After. During breastfeeding, you can see changes in lubrication, and again, they're not aroused necessarily. This is like a physiologic problem that they're having."

Are some people's vaginas just more lubricated at I want to say at rest. It's like the scientist in me. When there are sleep, for instance, I mean, men are having erections in their sleep.

Okay, let's spend a few minutes or more talking about female orgasm, one of the more cryptic topics on the Internet. Not because it isn't discussed, but because I think that the nuance of it isn't discussed often enough or in full depth. So let's take the time we need to parse this. I think that the simplest way to parse it is going to be, from the anatomical standpoint, clitoral orgasm versus so called g spot, or penetration based orgasm. But, of course, penetration based orgasm is also a bit of a misnomer, because there can be clitoral stimulation by pelvic pressure or by digit. We're talking about fingers as digits because we're both in the medical science profession. But we're talking about fingers here or something else, right? Vibrator, toy, whatever I'm toe for depends on how flexible you are. I don't know. But the point being that I think the simplest way to go about this is going to be to talk about the distinction between clitoral orgasm and g spot orgasm, however those are achieved, and to also talk about this idea of graded versus absolute. This has actual parallels to neuroscience, where we talk about communication between neurons being graded, meaning it's kind of one level, then a higher level than a lower level, where all are none. How shall I say this? It is clear in my life experience and observation that there are multiple kinds of female orgasm. Those that are graded and in some cases cumulative, they sort of build towards a larger and larger orgasm. And then there are what some people have described as cliff type orgasms where there's a refractory period. I think that's a fair way to frame this. And clearly, there are different responses to the orgasm response. Some people get sleepy. Some people get energized. Some people, it heightens their desire for more. Some people, they need a period of time in which they become hypersensitive to touch. So lots of different things going on there psychologically, physiologically, tell us all of it."

And when you look at the data, and again, female sexual dysfunction data is not super robust. But what we find is that about 85% of women require clitoral stimulation in order to climax. So very few actually climax through just vaginal penetration alone. And so this is, you know, a real ProbLeM we're seeing on the Media that, you know, you have Sex and you penetrate, and immediately Women are having orgasms. That's not the reality for a lot of women. And in terms of stimulation, so, like we've talked about throughout this podcast, the ClitorIs is the HoMoLOGue of the PenIS, or their PenIs is the HoMoloGue of the Clitoris.

        "text": "That too. But there's a huge gap there. And so I think to bring it home is that clitoral stimulation is the most reliable way. And as you mentioned, when you're stimulating vaginally, you're often, the clitoris is like a wishbone, and it goes around the vagina. And so you're often stimulating those. The crura is what we call the legs, I guess, for lack of a better term, of the clitoris. And so you're stimulating that. You're also stimulating the clitoral shaft, which goes deep into the pelvis. The g spot is an area as an erogenous zone where it's in the anterior wall of the vagina, about two to 3 cm in. That's the location of these periorethral glands called the skene's glands. And they are analogous or homologous to the male prostate. Just like some men have prostate play and enjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation, some women enjoy g spot stimulation. Now, that's not universal, right? Not all men enjoy prostate play, and not all women are going to be aroused by g spot stimulation. And so I think there's a huge variety of ways you can stimulate anyone. It can be man or woman. Some people will have orgasms through just nipple stimulation alone. Some will just hear something or see something and be able to achieve an orgasm. And it's so varied from person to person. And I think that the big take home from this for people listening is like, you have to talk to your partner. And this is the hardest thing. We never learned how to talk about sex. Like, what do you like? What do you not like? And don't take it personally, right? Like, I think a lot of times people feel like you have to orgasm to have pleasure, which may not be the case for everybody. And if it is, you know, how do you prioritize that for your relationships? So I don't know if I got off track there, but that's kind of, I think the take homes for this and also the vaginal penetration, it's actually usually from cervical stimulation, not necessarily vaginal, because the large density of innervation of the vagina is in the first outer third of the vagina. The deeper two thirds of the vagina has much less innervation."

Years ago, when I worked on hormone based sexual differentiation, which, by the way, we've done an episode of the podcast on previously, you know, I learned that the levator animuscle is the muscle that controls erection in males, and presumably clitoral tumescence and engorgement in females. Is there an equivalent muscle responsible for the orgasm response? Or is the contraction of the pelvic floor part of a more general theme of muscular contraction and a bunch of different nerve roots contracting? The reason I ask this is that eventually in this conversation, we're going to migrate up toward the brain. But because this is a science and health podcast, when we talk about orgasm, of course many people recognize that as their experience of it and their recognition of it in other people and descriptions, et cetera. But are we talking about a response that originates at a foci, kind of like in the brain? We talk about a seizure starting at a focus of foci and then spreading out? Or are we talking about a bunch of different nerve roots and brain centers firing in synchrony? And that's why some people experience it as behind their forehead and in their genitals, or as a whole body response. And here we're not talking about the flood of neurochemicals into the body. I'm talking about during those moments of orgasm, what is happening neurally. I mean, it does have certain parallels to seizure, right?"

So actually, what happens during the reason you get an erection, and presumably clitoral stimulation. The same way is blood flows into the erectile tissue and the tunica, which is the outer layers of the erectile tissue, which are two basically cylindrical shaped structures in the penis and in the clitoris. They will fill with blood, and then that tunica will compress veins on the outside to prevent blood flow from leaving. So it's not a muscular event. It's an actual blood flow event."

Erection and clitoral tumescence. Although it's harder to measure in rodents, there's a way of indirectly measuring that. And then we would measure the size and weight of the levator ani muscles as a readout of how androgenized that whole system was. In other words, what is the role of the levatorian in the sexual response?"

So whether it's orgasm for male or female, they're contracting and they're exercising, right? So that's how they would increase their strength or their density, if you're measuring that through the actual climax of what you can't see in rodents. Right? So, like, you're kind of using it as a surrogate in that way. So that's what happens. Those muscles contract as a response, and climax is a brain initiated event. Orgasm is a brain initiated event. So that's why, to answer your second part, you obviously feel focal response, but you also can feel a variety of responses because it's all coming from the brain. It's not the way you described it as, like a ripple effect. It's more of like, it's the way your body responds to that particular stimuli. And it's actually like the ultimate form of mindfulness. Think of anything else when you're orgasming, right? So it's like you have this moment of clarity and everything. You were very present in that moment. And so people will feel different stimulations depending on how they kind of how their sensor, you know, their nerves are, their sensations are, and things like that."

        "text": "This is perhaps a good time to mention dopamine. We talked about it a few times earlier. When talking about the arousal arc that starts with parasympathetic sort of calm and then move typically starts as calm and then moves to the orgasm response. We know that the orgasm response is associated with release of dopamine and then prolactin, which sets up the relative or absolute refractory period. The interesting thing, and I got some questions about this, is that there's literature, as I understand, about the elevation in dopamine caused by, say, antidepressants like wellbutrin, brupirin, which increases dopamine and norepinephrine. People who recreationally use drugs like cocaine or other stimulants, people who take Adderall, Vyvanse, or other drugs that increase levels of dopamine, because I did a whole episode about those drugs, and they are different forms of amphetamine, unless we're talking about Ritalin, which is a little bit different. And I got a lot of questions about people who experience feeling a lot of desire, sort of arousal, but not being able to achieve the physical arousal, erection or vaginal lubrication. So it's almost as if they're sitting further along that arousal arc. Hence the importance, I think, of people learning to have calm states of mind when going into sexual interactions. Now, I realize that in saying that, it might be confusing because a lot of people think, well, that's anything but calm. Sexual arousal is anything but calm, but maintaining enough calm that they can ride that arc for whatever duration is appropriate for that interaction in them. Right. Because, again, and we should probably get back to this, some people will have sex for long periods of time, some for shorter periods of time. And here people don't really know what other people are doing, except by way of pornography and self report and discussion. So is it the case that drugs that increase dopamine can inhibit the sexual response? Do they tend to promote the sexual response? Because I also mentioned earlier, there's this growing trend of people taking, by way of prescription, of course, from a physician, combined apomorphine, which is a dopaminergic drug, with tadalafil, which is a PDE five inhibitor. So it's going to increase blood flow. And I'm hearing about men and women, but mainly men doing this. So ramping up their dopamine, ramping up their blood flow to their genitals in order to have, presumably more arousal in sex. Does that make sense as a mechanism?"

So we don't use it very often here in the United States because it hasn't been FDA approved, but it's a very complex response. So, like I mentioned, that flavansirin which is a centrally acting medication. It actually has not only inhibitory and not only stimulatory, but also inhibitory effects on dopamine. So the way it sort of works to enhance interest or libido is sort of complex and kind of confusing. When it was actually approved, it was being studied for an antidepressant. And what they found was that women were actually having better interest in sex or more interest in sex. And so that's kind of how it discovered. Similarly, Viagra was actually studied for high blood pressure. And when they went to, it was horrible blood pressure medication. But then the people, the men who took it actually didn't return the samples for the study, so they realized, like, what's going on here? And it was because they were having better erections."

I did a long episode on fertility, and we're going to have a few other IVF experts, fertility experts on the podcast. But clearly, there are differences in hormones across the menstrual cycle. We know that for sure. Clearly there can be psychological variation according to those hormones, but probably other things across the menstrual cycle. And it's always an imperfect experiment because we aren't laboratory rats and people are having different interactions across the menstrual cycle. Is there any known correlation between desire and stage of the menstrual cycle. There are some obvious assumptions that one might make prior to ovulation, et cetera, around the time of ovulation. But what about the other direction, too? Is there a category of women that are very interested in sex at certain stages of their menstrual cycle and then not at all interested in sex at other stages of the menstrual cycle?"

So, meaning that you're penetrating, but there's like a rocking. There's motion that can also penetrate the clitoris. There's stimulation of just the outer part of the vagina, which, again, as I mentioned, the g spot is there. It's more highly innervated, so that can be more stimulating. There's also ways to align yourself so that when you're penetrating, you're putting pressure on the clitoris. And then there's, you know, stimulation with, like, actual stimulation of the clitoris, like intentional stimulation either by yourself or by the partner. And so there are multiple different ways to do that. Right. And so I think that it's important to really kind of, it's okay to explore and not always be a home run. And I think that's like, when you get into a relationship where you're maybe 2nd, 3rd, 4th, time having intercourse with someone, that you can try and explore these different things, or if the partner themselves knows what they like to actually tell the other partner. Right. There's a huge part of communication that I think plays a huge role in this because we know ourselves better than anyone else. So you can tell your partner what you like, and I think that we have never been taught how to do that."

And that almost always circles back to the key four things we talked about earlier, which is consent and age appropriate, context appropriate, these kinds of things. And obviously, substances like alcohol and other drugs can strongly confound those issues. And so we'll just leave that as a kind of an obvious one. As long as we're talking about communication around sexual interactions, perhaps it would be useful to people to cultivate a language or a nomenclature there, too, to facilitate that. Some of the language that I've heard that is quite useful is things like, people have different arousal templates. Some people, certain ideas are stimulating to them, and other ideas are aversive to them. And then there's this category in between where sometimes people sort of either don't know because they haven't tried it or haven't thought about it, or they're sort of curious but kind of unsure. Or it might work in the right context, but maybe not all the time. So is there any kind of structure that's been put out there as a way to improve communication around sexual interactions?"

And then, you know, I think also part of it is like being open about those things. And it may. It's not gonna happen in one conversation. I think that's the hard part. You think you're going to have a conversation, it's going to go great, and things are going to be better. It's going to be like multiple conversations, and some of them are not going to go well. That's another place where you can actually get the help of a sex therapist. And there is a website for that. It's aasect asect.org, comma, where you can look for a sex therapist near you and you can even do those things virtually.

Oftentimes you'll learn things about people's sexual past, and that can be either neutral, stimulating, or aversive. Right. That can open up all sorts of other issues related to the psychological interplay. So there's no way we can parse all of those now. I just think it's worth highlighting that it's understandable why those conversations are challenging. And it also is understanding why pornography isn't going to involve those conversations. The only conversations there are between your brain, your hands, and your eyes and your ears. Not going to highlight any particular order there. I want to switch gears slightly and talk about Utis. I got a lot of questions about urinary tract infections. Let's make it related to both females and males, because, yes, males get urinary tract infections, females get them more females. Asked about urinary tract infections. How common are they? Should they always be treated with antibiotics? Is cranberry really a good treatment? If so, why? Are there other things that are better? Is it related to the acidity or alkalinity? How does one prevent getting utis? Can you get them from swimming? Should you urinate after sex? Tell us about utis and how not to get them and how to get rid of them."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Happy to. So utis are very common in women. Probably up to 50% of women get at least one UTI in their lifetime, and up to a third of them get recurrent UTIs. And what that means is they have two or more in six months or three or more in a year. Now, this is common, and so we'll see a lot of it. And it's not as until you're having recurrent UTI, say you just have one a year or you have one every few years. It's not a huge issue. In men, however, UTIs are much less common, and that's because the urethra is longer, so there's less entry from the outside world into the bladder, which causes infections. And so when men get a UTI, it's concerning. Like, why is a man getting a UTI? There's multiple reasons that it could happen, but it should be investigated so that you can make sure there's no anatomic abnormality or functional abnormality with a bladder that's causing the UtIs. In terms of prevention, there are kind of major things that are highlighted in the guidelines that we all talk about. So one is hydration. So making sure you're drinking about two to three liters of fluid, ideally water a day, because dilution is the solution to the pollution. Right. So drinking more fluids is going to get that bacteria and you're going to pee it out. It's going to help keep, not let it sit around in the bladder very often. Another thing in women who have altered states of estrogen, whether it's postmenopausal surgical menopause, or maybe have reduced estrogen for postpartum or other reasons, what about during."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Not necessarily for those specific people, but for those specific times, but because it's pretty short lived, I guess you could use it. But is vaginal estrogen. So vaginal estrogen, meaning estrogen that's applied in the vagina either through a cream, a suppository, or a ring, is highly effective in reducing the occurrence of recurrent utis. And this is because when you have low estrogen, the ph in the vagina goes up and the ph in the vagina goes up because there's less conversion of glycogen to lactobacilli and then those lactobacilli are preventative for utis. So essentially you want to reduce the ph back to its normal acidic ph. And vaginal estrogen is very effective at doing that. In fact, in our clinics, we'll actually check a vaginal ph, you know, to see if there is an indication that their ph is too high, that maybe they do need vaginal estrogen, particularly on like, perimenopause. Pause. Because it's hard to tell just by looking if they are really heading into a lower estrogen state sometimes. And so that's very, very effective and very, very safe. So when you look at estrogen, the women's health initiative way back when, sort of made a big stink about how estrogen is related to cancer. However, vaginal estrogen has never, ever been a reported breast cancer, uterine cancer, or any other blood clot, any other adverse event associated with vaginal estrogen. You can get some breast tenderness, some discharge, those things can occur, but the absorbed amount vaginally is so little that your estrogen level barely goes up. It doesn't even reach premenopausal levels, so it just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream, not enough to create any sort of abnormality. So vaginal estrogen is extremely safe, and it's pretty affordable. You could actually use coupons if your insurance doesn't cover it through Goodrx or Mark Cuban's pharmacy, and get it very, very affordably. And it's very effective. It does take about three months to work, so you have to be consistent. You apply it about twice a week at night, sometimes three times a week, and it's very effective. The ring you put in once and it lasts for three months. Generally speaking, that's the most effective option for low estrogen states. Other kind of simple things are trying to make sure you're completely emptying your bladder. So over a lifetime, people can develop some mild pelvic floor dysfunction, right? Not enough to create pain or discomfort, but maybe they're not emptying completely, right? Because maybe they used to hold their urine for long periods of time when they were a kid, or maybe they're always hovering over the toilet because they don't want to sit on it at work. And over time, that can create a little bit of mild dysfunction, which can make it more difficult to completely empty the bladder. And when urine is sitting in the bladder for long periods of time, it's basically food for bacteria to grow. And so bacteria grows, and then you get recurrent UTI. So making sure you completely empty by sitting, relaxing on the toilet, sometimes leaning forward, and then maybe going a second time. So standing up, sitting back down, going again, and even for men, sometimes trying to sit and see if you completely empty, because sometimes standing, you're not able to empty completely."

And so then people are like, oh, is this better for me to sit to pee or stand to pee? And there was this whole big discussion on the media. But the reason being is when you're sitting, your pelvic floor is most relaxed. And so if you're having any issues emptying your bladder, you're going to pee better. Also if you have an enlarged prostate, which I'm sure we're going to talk about prostate enlargement, that can sometimes allow you to develop a little bit more intra abdominal pressure because you're sitting and you can lean forward to overcome sort of a blockage. And so there are some, some indications where sitting is better. But if you're peeing fine and you're standing, that's fine, too. I don't think you have to. I think it's just something that, you know, in other countries they do more, and here we don't. And I don't think I, right or wrong, it just depends on your individual circumstance."

Like, do I just drink juice? It's actually a specific active ingredient in the cranberry, which is called proanthocyanidins, or pacs. And they've actually looked at the amount of pacs you need and what formulation. So you need 36 milligrams of pacs in a soluble form. So a lot of the supplements on the market will say that they're 36 milligrams of pacs but they're like the whole berry. So they're using the. The skin of the berry and the stem of the berry, and that's not gonna help you.

And that may be helpful, but there's not a lot of data there, but certainly an option that you can try that's pretty low risk. So that's kind of the guidelines. Now, there's a ton of other things that you can do to help prevent that are kind of available and have some data behind them. So D mannose is one of them, where you take about 2 grams a day of D mannose, and you drink it, and that actually helps reduce UTI risk. It's been studied in a small, randomized, controlled trial to be effective. Those are the bigger ones. There's other things that people use, like probiotics, but there's a lot of heterogeneity, as, you know, in probiotics and what to take. And are they really effective vaginally in the flora there? So those are kind of the big things. And there is actually a lot of microbiome study and UtIs going on, actually, at UCLA, where they're looking at the microbiome of people who are more at risk for UtIs or even overactive bladder, other conditions like that. And they're trying to figure out, like, is there something here that we can target or that we can figure out is causing problems? Because sometimes we just can't figure out why it's happening. In terms of wiping from front to back and swimming and peeing after sex, there's no good data on any of those things. Wiping from front to back. I think it does create a little bit of, like, shame. Like, it's not a big deal. Wipe back to front as long as you're not, like, you know, as long as you've, like, cleaned yourself, so to speak. So I think it's less of an issue."

It's probably a microbiome effect or a hormonal effect, or there's something going on that we need to investigate further.

One of them could be that another very common one that we already touched on is pelvic floor dysfunction. So very often, pelvic floor dysfunction, just like you had pain with urination, women can also develop pain with urination that doesn't go away, and it can start where they had a UTI that triggered the pelvic floor. And then the pelvic floor just didn't relax. But the pain just triggered the pelvic floor to tense up, and it didn't relax because, again, we're not taught how to relax our pelvic floor. And then they've developed pelvic floor dysfunction. Like, why is UTI not going away? Why does it keep coming back?

The other was, I realized that it is possible to have a pelvic floor that's neither hyper contracted nor over relaxed, and in some cases, just not doing anything for it is the best circumstance. And the only reason I mention that is because, obviously, this discussion is not about my pelvic floor. This discussion is about the fact that some people perhaps need to clean less. Some people maybe more, but probably not based on what you said. Some people might need to strengthen their pelvic floor, some people might need to relax their pelvic floor, and some people's pelvic floor is probably a okay. I think any discussion about anything medical or especially hormone stuff, this happens a lot in the discussions around that I get into. It seems with males, every male now seems to wonder if their testosterone is too low, except the ones that are blasting testosterone because they know it's excessively high. As you pointed out earlier, at least in terms of sexual function, that's unlikely to be the case. Maybe less desire, but in terms of genital based arousal function, probably, yeah."

And it's all been very positive. And since there's been increased sexual desire, based on validated questionnaires, increased number of sexually satisfying events with testosterone use. Now, the range of testosterone in women is about a 10th of the amount of testosterone a man needs. Right. So testosterone cream is systemically absorbed wherever you apply it. And so the way we generally recommend women to try this if they are having low libido, and we've ruled out other issues that may be psychologic relationship, other issues that can affect libido, medications, there's a lot of things, obviously, that go into that. But if we said, and we've checked their testosterone, it appears to be low for physiological levels for women, which, again, is one 10th of the male level, then we can actually prescribe off label testosterone. And the guidelines or the consensus statements are not like true guidelines, but they recommend using transdermal testosterone. So getting androgel tubes from the pharmacy and putting a 10th of one tube on the back of the calf or the upper outer buttock, a hairless area for absorption that can improve desiree overall. And then the other place we use testosterone is in women who have what we call vestibulodynia. So the vestibule is the area outside the vagina, which is very hormonally active. There's lots of androgen receptors there. And it can actually, when you have hormonal issues, meaning lower testosterone and estrogen in that area, it can cause pain. And so actually applying a combined or compounded estrogen, testosterone, to that area, over time can reduce that pain and discomfort. So, as you know, testosterone receptors, or androgen receptors all over the body, very much in the genitals, very much in the brain, and they're very useful to a very useful place to treat women for those issues."

I mean, each person is individual. If you get a kidney stone, typically, we do what's called a 24 hours urine analysis plus some blood work to assess what is the metabolic abnormality. So we can target that either with diet or with medication. And so the kind of general recommendations for people who have kidney stones. One is increase your fluid intake to two to three liters. Again, the same number I told you before, you want to decrease your oxalate intake. Now, if you google oxalate, you're going to find a million things that you eat that have oxalate in them. But the big ones are spinach and rhubarb. We're seeing a lot of nuts, too, that are, you know, people eating a lot more nuts to get more protein. So, you know, cutting back, it's impossible to get rid of all of that in your diet. But if you're having, like, a spinach salad every day, well, switch it to a different green. Right. Don't eat spinach every day. Also, you want to increase your citrate intake. That's an inhibitor of kidney stone formation. So increasing fruits and. And things like that to increase citrate vegetables as well. Actually, one easily accessible thing is crystal light. It has a high citrate composition, so you can drink crystal light with that, two to three liters, and that can be helpful. You want to decrease your protein intake. So high levels of purines or pure genic meats, like red meats, and things can also put you at higher risk. So these are kind of the general sort of preventative measures we talk about for kidney stones, if you have a kidney stone. So, a lot of times, people can have kidney stones in their kidneys. They're not creating any problems. They're tiny. We can observe them over time if they start getting very large or they are starting to move into the ureters or the tubes that drain the kidney, oftentimes, they're accompanied with pain, quite a bit of pain. And it can be very uncomfortable in those cases if they're not having any infection symptoms, meaning there's no signs of a urinary tract infection. There's no fevers, no chills. We can treat it conservatively with pain medication. And also there are medications like flomax, which we use for enlarged prostate as well, that actually relaxes the ureteral smooth muscle to allow the stone to pass a little bit better. If you're having an infection, you got to get it treated right away. You can get very sick very quickly. In fact, I've seen young, healthy patients, like, they're healthier than me, walk in the ER with a kidney stone, and within 24 hours, they're in the ICU because they're really sick because of a."

We can't go into extreme depth on everything, but appreciate your willingness to follow this carousel with me. Oral contraception. Previously on this podcast, I hosted a female physician guest who offered both sides of female oral contraception. Discuss some of the benefits, discuss some of the risks. I made the decision to post clips about both on the Internet and wow, wow, wow. Was I surprised, but also, frankly, a bit shocked. And then finally intrigued by how polarized the discussion is around female oral contraception and female contraception in general. So nuvaring nor plant the pill. Broad category of things there. But for sake of discussion, the pill, etcetera. I mean, it seemed that approximately 50% of responses, which seemed to come mainly from women, were of the. This stuff is terrible. It ruined my life. It ruins lives. It destroys you. It has immense risk. And then the other half seem to say, no, there's reduced risk of certain forms of cervical cancer. This has allowed me the sexual choices and lifestyle that I prefer without risk of pregnancy. I mean, it was astonishing to the point where I thought, wow, if only I could post both clips simultaneously. So obviously, I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that this is among the more polarizing topics available for discussion. So what is the story? Meaning what are the data about oral contraception? Why so much controversy? And what's the real deal here?"

        "speaker": "B",

In fact, we even did a study, and again, this is not like high quality evidence, but we looked at Reddit threads and we looked at sexual dysfunction, specifically low libido, orgasm like difficulties. And we read hundreds of threads and we did a qualitative analysis in females to see what are people talking about and problems with oral contraceptives and antidepressants leading to low libido. And being very like, as you described, very like this has ruined my life was very common. And so the theory is that, you know, taking oral contraceptives increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin, which binds testosterone and estrogen, and that actually makes testosterone less available, which is, as we've talked about, a very important hormone for desire. And so in some subset of people, they're seeing very significant consequences of taking oral contraceptives. Now, I think that there is, you know, we don't know which women are going to have this problem and we don't know how. It's probably a very small subset of people. But we do know that this does happen and that when you measure shbg levels, they're up. And that even after they stop the oral contraceptives, you'll see, see elevated SHBG levels from baseline for how long? You know, for like, at least four months afterwards, you'll still see elevated SHBG levels. So we don't know."

Oral contraceptives are amazing and they've changed gynecology and management of these women in a very positive way.

I can tell you want to move on from this topic, so we will, before discussing prostate and anal sex not stated next to one another for any particular reason, I want to talk about SSRI's. A lot of people over the last 2030 years have been prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants that have disrupted their sexual function or their sexual desire, it seems. In particular, do you see a lot of this in your clinic? Do you hear about it? What can people do about it? Oftentimes, these sexual arousal or dysfunction issues associated with SSRI's and other medications make those medications prohibitive for people."

And then there's also other sexual dysfunctions we see with it. And it does happen. Absolutely. It's dose dependent. So in some cases, when someone comes in with SSRI related dysfunction, if they're doing well, you can either try to reduce the dose or switch them to another antidepressant, for example, wellbutrin, that does not have such severe effects on sexual function. And so you can also use, like, cialis and Viagra, like we've talked about, for erectile dysfunction as an addition, if we can't change their medication management, because, you know, and this gets a little bit complicated because we know erectile dysfunction, depression are very interrelated. Now, what's causing what? And what? You know, where do we, like, maybe somebody went to see their doctor for depression, but was also having issues with erections. And now what do you. If you fix the erections, do you help with the depression? Like what? You know what I mean?"

Improving blood flow to the prostate, reducing prostitus, maybe even reducing the probability of prostate cancer. What other sorts of things are you encouraging men to think about when thinking about their prostate?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So before I forget, I want to mention that low dose tadalafil is actually a treatment for erectile dysfunction. In fact, it works quite well, particularly in men who are having a lot of psychogenic issues. One, because they don't have to remember to take a pill before sex. It's always on board and you're taking five milligrams every day and it has a 36 hours half life. So over, you're kind of increasing those can actually work quite well and is a great option for erectile dysfunction. So I do want to make that caveat in terms of prostate health. It has been shown to be effective for BpH or enlarged prostate, and this is a very common condition. In fact, if you look at autopsy studies, 80% of men at 80 have an enlarged prostate like it's very, very common. Now, does everyone get symptoms, and what's the long term concerns of it? And, you know, what can you do about it? So, typically, as the prostate enlarges, it's right around the urethra. It's a walnut shaped gland sits underneath the bladder around the urethra, and it can narrow the urethra or the p tube. And so over time, you can imagine, like, if you're, I always give this example, if you're sucking from a straw, right? You're drinking from a straw. If you have a wide diameter straw, it's really easy to drink. If your straw gets really narrow, like, say you take a coffee straw and you drink out of that, it's very difficult to drink. Very similarly, it can become very difficult to urinate if you have an enlarged prostate. Now, what causes an enlarged prostate? There's a whole host of factors. A lot of them are genetic. So if your father or grandfather had a large prostate, you're probably more likely to have an enlarged prostate. Do we know exactly how to prevent that? Not exactly, but we know how to mediate the symptoms a little bit. So the other symptoms you'll see before you have difficulty urinating is sometimes you'll see see overactivity. So you'll see your bladders responding to having to push hard against that narrow urethra to push urine out. So it's having more urgency, like the sudden desire to go to the bathroom that you can't delay. You're maybe going more frequently and very often, you're going more often at night. And so those are kind of the first signs people will see. And then over time, it may become more and more difficult to empty the bladder. You might see some hesitancy, like, youre waiting for your stream to start, or it stops and starts. And so those, you know, or you're just like, I can't empty. Like, it's not because it drips or a very weak stream. And so those are kind of the things that can happen over a lifetime. Now, what, what are some things that you can do to help? You know, Cialis helps relax those, those, the fiber, the smooth muscle of the prostate so that it allows urine to pass more easily. There's also other medications that you can treat very often. Often flowmax or other alpha blockers are helpful in that area in terms of things that you can do in general for bladder health, prostate health, there are certain things that are irritants to that area. And so what I tell people, not everyone's affected the same way. So I don't want people to be like, oh, I got to stop all these delicious things I eat and drink. But certainly it can be useful to just pay attention. So, like, if you say you drink coffee every day and you find yourself right into the bathroom a lot, if you limit your caffeine intake, you might see that you're not going to the bathroom quite as often because caffeine is a bladder irritant. So that can be coffee, tea, chocolate, things of that nature that have caffeine in them. Energy drinks. Sometimes people forget they have caffeine in them. Limiting that may improve your symptoms. Alcohol also is a bladder irritant. These have actually been studied in animal models. See that the bladder contracts more often when they're given these sorts of substances, and it's dose dependent. And some people can actually habituate or get used to a certain dose of caffeine. So if you're drinking coffee every day, you may have less symptoms than someone who drinks it every once in a while. Other things can be sometimes carbonated beverages, spicy foods, or acidic foods. Those sorts of things can also irritate the bladder lining. Sometimes limiting those things may be helpful in those situations."

Is that still a thing? I thought they put grooves into the seats, but I've also, in reading on the Internet, I didn't do a deep dive on Reddit, but it seems that women are reporting some bladder incontinence from excessive bicycle seat use, maybe even exercise. Bike doesn't have to be road bike."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So this is a great point. So cycling, if you think about it, right, you're sitting on your perineum, which is that space for men between the scrotum and the anus, for women, between the vagina and the anus. And right there runs your pudendal artery and your pudendal nerve, which are, again, responsible for blood flow and nerve function to the area. So the most common things we see in people who are, you know, who are really high volume cyclers. Now, the studies have looked at, like, maybe they did a 350 kilometer race or they're biking three times a week for 60 minutes, but there's no, like, consistency. But they're seeing pretty high rates of genital numbness. So, like, up to 50%. And also in men, erectile dysfunction. In women, you'll also see numbness, but because sensation is a big part of arousal, you'll also see kind of decreased lubrication maybe decreased arousal as well in women. And so how can you prevent that? The reason is because when you're sitting, particularly if you're leaning forward, like competitive bikers do, or aero riding, you're putting pressure on the beak of the bicycle seat. And that's where, you know, most of the, it's not, your weight is nothing distributed evenly. So the goal is to take a bike seat that allows you to sit comfortably on your ischial tuberosities. And posture is a huge part of your pelvic floor. I know we didn't talk about that earlier, but sitting, you know, with good posture and not kind of slouching or leaning forward can actually really do wonders for your pelvic floor. So focusing on posture is helpful, but also when biking, posture is helpful. So they've actually looked at this data and they found that people who arrow ride, meaning lean forward, or people who use narrow bike seats, are more likely to have issues. And so you want to get kind of a noseless seat and a wider seat. The cutouts, actually, when they've looked at kind of mechanics of the cutouts, they'll see higher pressure around the opening. So it's actually not good to have a bike with a cutout, bike seat with a cutout, because they've seen, at least with some of the cutouts, that the pressure actually becomes higher on the area that's right around it."

But there was actually another study that looked at people who were parts of sports clubs, so they were like swimmers, runners and cyclists, and they looked at rates of dysfunction and they found that actually the rate of erectile dysfunction was not different between runners, swimmers and cyclers. So maybe because those other studies were just looking at cyclers, that maybe it's just the general rate of erectile dysfunction in that population at that point in time. So the numbness is definitely an issue. The erectile dysfunction, maybe, maybe not."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No, I think that's one of the reasons that people. One of the reasons people do. But in general, the issue with anal sex is that people forget to use protection, like a condom, for example, because sexually transmitted infections are actually more likely with anal sex than they are with vaginal penetrative intercourse, because the anal tissue is very thin and friable. So when you penetrate the anus, particularly if you have any trauma, you can have blood loss, and that blood loss can then easily, more easily transmit sexually transmitted infection. So it's really important to use a condom and use adequately lubrication. The anus does not make any of its endogenous lubrication. You have to use lubricant. The other interesting thing about anal sex is that the anus ph is different from the vaginal ph. So you want to use specific lubricants that are ISO osmolar to anal ph. So you can actually look up anal lubricants. And we could talk about lubricants. But generally there's water based, silicone based, oil based lubricants. Water based are the most easily accessible. Silicone based, are a little more slippery and last a little longer, and oil based also last longer, but are not good for use with condoms. So definitely using lubricants and always kind of making sure to be in the context, of course, of being consensual, but also never force, always take your time and those things are really important to avoid trauma because trauma can happen. And usually it's nothing severe trauma. Right. It's not going to create long lasting problems, but it is, you know, inconvenient, uncomfortable, and probably we're not seeing as much of it because they're not coming to the emergency room if they're having issues unless it's really serious. So I think it's really important, one, to prevent from sexually transmitted infections. Two, to be thoughtful and cautious. And sometimes it requires some preparation. If you're going to penetrate an anus, it's going to, you know, you're not going to start with a large girth item. You're going to start with something smaller and kind of work your way up. And then I think, ultimately, why people have anal sex. So, as I mentioned earlier, the prostate is highly innervated and can be a source of pleasure. So some people enjoy that. Particularly men may enjoy anal penetration. Women as well may enjoy anal penetration because of the innervation around there, the pelvic floor. That's certainly reasonable to do. So as far as why people engage in anal sex. So sometimes it's because, as I mentioned, they're trying to avoid vaginal penetration, either to avoid pregnancy or maybe menstruation or other reasons. Sometimes it's because people want to do something special with their partner. Like, they feel like this is my special thing with this partner that I do with them. And so it may be something kind of like a gift or something like that. Sometimes it's almost like they feel like they have to. And this particular study that I looked at, there's actually not a lot of studies on why people engage in anal sex. And this particular study that I had talked about on my channel or on my instagram was talking about why they specifically recruited drug users. And so a lot of people had used drugs prior to using to engaging in anal sex. And I think that that's not ideal. You always want to be kind of in the right state of mind for consent and. And safety purposes. And so those were kind of the common reasons."

You can sometimes, I mean, the rare things that people have kind of commented on, like anal incontinence temporarily or things like that, very rare. Um, mostly it's. It's just sexually transmitted infections because, you know, you can't have more. It's more easy to create bleeding through anal sex if you're not careful."

        "text": "As a final category of question, I was really interested in some of the posts you've done about herbs and supplements in the context of sexual desire and sexual function on this podcast. I always say, always, always. We emphasize behavioral tools first do's and don'ts because those are the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance in all contexts. There is of course, a role for prescription drugs. Sometimes. Oftentimes people can't do the things and avoid the certain things they want to because of depressive states, anxious states, etcetera and prescription drugs can serve a role. But I do believe the goal is always behaviors first. Then of course, things like adequate sleep, nutrition, healthy social interaction, all of that stuff, exercise. But we do often talk about supplements because they represent, I think, an important category of over the counter compounds that can play a role. I've talked before about Tonga Ali, this indonesian herb. I think it can be malaysian as well. But this indonesian herb is typically the one that I am aware works best for mild libido enhancement. Sometimes, especially in the case of people taking SSRI's, it can enhance libido to override some of the challenges with SSRI induced reduction in libido. And generally, even if people aren't under SSRI's, I hear from people who take tonga ali and get libido increases. Also things like maca, root which we don't really know how these things work exactly. Probably some freeing up of testosterone with tongad Ali, maybe some cortisol suppression as well, maybe some estrogen receptor modulation with maca root, maybe some dopaminergic tone changes. Shilaji, this ayurvedic herb, which there is at least one study that I think is done well that shows increases in FSH, follicle stimulating hormone with shilaji use. What are your thoughts on things like Tonga Ali maca root? Shilaji, how do you talk to your patients about this stuff?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that I see at least my patient population is still in the behavioral management place. Right. The biggest cause of sexual dysfunction, whether it's low testosterone, erectile dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is often comorbidities. Right. So managing high blood pressure, managing diabetes with diet, which you talk about a lot, but the best studied diet is the mediterranean diet, at least in a sexual dysfunction literature, exercise, like doing both cardiovascular aerobic exercise, but also doing resistance training, particularly like large muscle groups, and then really working on reducing blood pressure and preventing diabetes. And those things, I think are really key. And I know you talk about them a lot on this podcast, but I will tell you that when people are getting ready for, for example, we do a surgery for erectile dysfunction called penile prosthesis. So this is like, end of the line. Nothing's working. They can't get an erection at all. It can be, and they may have diabetes as a cause of it. And when we say, you know, you have to get your hemoglobin a one c below a certain level to do surgery, I cannot tell you how quickly these men change their behaviors for sake of erections. For sake of erections. So I think that really, if I can say one thing before you do supplements, which I don't have a problem with, I think that it's reasonable to try them. I would try one at a time to see what's working. And so you're not taking a bunch of things and not knowing what exactly is working and realizing that they're not going to work immediately. If you take something that works immediately, it's probably got a PDE five inhibitor mixed in there. And so it's going to kind of build over time, and you're going to see changes over time. But I would say that the number one thing that I recommend for people is improving their diet, exercising, getting good sleep, as you know, it boosts testosterone. And even, you know, you mention this all the time about getting early morning light, but it's it's beneficial for testosterone as well, because you're really helping release testosterone with a circadian biology. So I think that those things I can't stress enough, like how valuable they are. And if you're smoking, quit smoking. It will kill your erection and vaping. And vaping."

It is the canary in the coal mine, meaning that it's the sign that you may be developing cardiovascular problems or like endothelial dysfunction that's first presenting in the penis or in their sexual organs. And this probably is the same for women. We just don't have the data yet."

        "text": "I know a good number of women that take Tonga Ali in part, I think, on the recommendation, although I want to be clear, I never recommended it. It was an offer of something that people could try if they're doing everything else correctly and could assess with consulting your physician, of course. And they too. Some of them have reported improvements in libido and desire as well. Yeah. Shiloh ji is less known about the distinguishing quality versus low quality. Sources of Shilaji is harder. Dosing is harder. It comes as this tar typically. Maybe more science on Shilaji will come out in the next few years. We could get behind it a bit more. Right now I'm sort of on the. Yeah, maybe if you are an adventurer, you might try it, but it's not one that I normally throw to the top of the list."

I think there is reasonable data on these things. I think the website you talk about all the time, examine.com, is a great place to look at that. Like I said, I think it's reasonable. They're smaller studies. There is bias in many studies, but there is effort done in this area and there's never going to be really high quality science. No one's going to really fund that. I think. I think our expectations need to. To be a little tempered when it comes to that stuff."

So thank you so much. And also thank you for the work you do day in and day out, week in and week out in your clinic. We will provide links to your clinic.
