        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Colman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz is a former tier one Navy SEAL special operator. I think it's fair to assume that most of you have never heard of Coleman Ruiz before, and in fact, it was part of his former life job description to be largely covert, such that only his family and friends really knew what he did for a living. He is, however, now living as a civilian and the reason I invited Coleman on this podcast was essentially to tell us his life story, which of course includes his time in the SEAL teams, but includes so much more that I'm certain is of value to everyone. Today, Coleman shares with you his remarkable journey from childhood through his teenage years into the military, and some of the things that happened during his time in the military, which then informed of his post military civilian life and what it is to be a father, a husband, and somebody who has experienced tremendous loss at various stages of his life, as well as tremendous triumph. Indeed, if ever there was a life that could be framed within the context of the so called hero's journey, it is the life of Coleman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz life is one that embodies focus and pursuit, family and friends and love, all the things that we think of in terms of having a rich life, but also one that includes many unforeseen tragedies, many unforeseen challenges, both internal and external. Coleman also shares with a rare and extraordinary degree of vulnerability the extent to which challenges in life, both external and internal, have helped shape him as a human being. What follows is a discussion that everyone, male, female, young or old, and regardless of position in life, is sure to derive tremendous benefit from. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Betterhelp. Betterhelp offers professional therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online. I've been doing therapy for over 30 years. Initially I started therapy because, well, I was required to in order to stay in school. But eventually I just decided to keep doing it because I found it to be very beneficial. There are essentially three things that great therapy provides. First of all, it provides a rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk about all issues with. Second of all, they can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance. And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights that you wouldn't have otherwise had access to. In fact, I consider doing regular therapy as important as working out one's body in the gym or through cardiovascular exercise. And with betterhelp, scheduling and doing therapy becomes extremely convenient. They can match you to a therapist that can provide those three things, excellent rapport, support and insight, and they can do so on a schedule that matches yours. If you'd like to try betterhelp, go to betterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off your first month. Again, that's betterhelp.com hubermandhenne Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before on this podcast and with several expert guests on this podcast about the fact that most of us should be seeking to get about 1 gram of quality protein per pound of body weight every day. Not only does that protein provide critical building blocks for things like muscle repair and synthesis, but also for overall metabolism and health. Eating enough quality protein each day is also a terrific way to stave off hunger. One of the key things, however, is to make sure that you're getting enough quality protein without ingesting excess calories. Maui nui venison has an extremely high quality protein per calorie ratio, such that getting 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight is both easy and doesn't cause you to ingest an excess of calories. Also, maui nui venison is absolutely delicious. They have venison steaks, they have ground venison and they have venison bone broth. I personally like all of those. In fact, I probably eat a maui nui venison burger pretty much every day, and occasionally I'll swap that for a maui nui steak. And if you're really on the go, they have maui nui venison jerky which has 10 grams of protein per stick at just 55 calories. If you'd like to try maui nui venison, you can go to maui nui venison.com huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that's maui nui venison.com huberman Today's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep. Eight sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need to get sleep, both enough sleep and enough quality sleep. When we do that, everything, our mental health, our physical health, performance in any sports or school, etcetera, all get better. And when we're not sleeping well or enough, all those things suffer. One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is that your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed, your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees. One of the best ways to ensure that happens is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And with eight sleep, it makes it very easy to do that. You program in the temperature that you want at the beginning, middle and end of the night. You can even divide the temperature for two different people. If you have two different people sleeping in the bed and it tracks your sleep, it tells you how much slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting, it really helps you dial in the correct parameters to get the best possible night's sleep for you. I've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for well over three years now, and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better. If you'd like to try eight sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com huberman and save $150 off their pod. Three cover, eight sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's eightsleep.com huberman and now for my conversation with Coleman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz, welcome."

I grew up in, I was born in New Orleans, in a suburb called New Orleans east, we call it, and have an older sister, two younger brothers. My dad was a welder. My mom was a dental assistant. And we had a couple of boxers and the dogs. And we had a very modest, very modest upbringing. I won't over dramatize it, but, you know, admittedly, you know, sometimes we got cheese from the lady across the street who didn't want her welfare cheese. And it was one of those, you know, I could tell my parents were fighting for every nickel, but it was great. I mean, my cousin grew up across the street from me. He's exactly my age. We had that at least some of my memory, Andrew, of it was. It was very pleasant. I learned later that you forget a lot of things in your childhood that were unpleasant. But my initial memories, when I started thinking about this kind of thing and, you know, as you and I have discussed getting professional help, and you start to learn a little bit more about your childhood. But I remember it being very pleasant. You know, you've told me about your background in skateboarding and stuff. You know, we skateboarded the neighborhood. BMX was a big thing when we were kids. It was very much a rat the streets upbringing. There was a park behind the neighborhood. We would cut through the fence and go, you know, this kind of thing. I played football and baseball, and very normal in that regard. I went to the neighborhood school, and then in 6th grade, I went to what was my high school, but it went fifth through 12th, called Holy Cross High School in the lower 9th ward, which that spot is now vacated because the school, I went back after Hurricane Katrina, the whole school had to be moved. And I went there in 7th grade, and it was a hellacious start. I mean, it was detention after detention, you know, fistfight after fistfight, and damn near."

But I was definitely on, you know, problem situation number whatever, when my parents were called in, and it was kind of the last straw type thing, and I got cut from baseball. My grades were fine. I was always a pretty good student. It was just teenager shenanigans. And then I went out for wrestling."

So, on the violence part, I have a little bit of experience with this, but violence can come from trying to protect others, instigating it can come from the wildness. Just trying to see what it feels like, experimentation and any number of other things, all the way to pure sociopathy, which we know you are not and weren't. Do you recall feeling something inside that inspired this? Was it for attention? Did it feel good afterwards? Can you recall what it was about?"

Obviously, my profession later in the military, you know, I was able to activate that, and I feel like I still can. And I was certainly able to in sports, which is why that 7th grade year was really pivotal. But even now, it's even funny you ask about the wildness, because let me put it in movie terms. Like, one of my favorite movie scenes of all time is in the movie the town, when Ben Affleck walks in the room. Jeremy Renner is the, you know, his partner, essentially. And he walks in the room and he says, we're going to hurt somebody. I can't tell you where and I can't tell you when. And he pauses, and Jeremy Renner takes maybe a three second pause, and he says, whose car are we taking? He doesn't even ask. You know, he's just. They're just wild and excited about doing something wild. I don't promote, like, going to hurt somebody. Of course."

And I think it's just exciting, you know, I hate rules. I hate being told what to do. It's one of the things that was so frustrating about the military. The rules are in place for a reason. They're written in blood. I get all that, but we're so constrained sometimes. I think that was just all coming into fruition that 7th grade year. And I enjoyed going wild. Like it was just fun. And frankly, we weren't. These fistfights and this trouble wasn't like going to get some kid. Those other kids wanted the wildness too, you know, and so. But the school didn't want that. And then I went out for wrestling that year, and I could put it all into the wrestling room, and it was awesome."

        "text": "Before we talk about wrestling and why it was so meaningful as a channel for you, a little bit of neurobiology, or else I wouldn't be Andrew Huberman. There's a really interesting phenomenon that one observes in both animals and humans, which is that somewhere around adolescence when the hormone surge begins. But even before that, there's a phenomenon called dispersal. It's very different than fighting per se, or sexual activity per se. It's a literal dispersal from one's home environment or an animal is a nest in which animals and humans, and we're animals, after all, start foraging new environments in a very, as you point out, chaotic way. It's not organized. It's a little nuts. And biologists and neurobiologists in particular have observed changes in neural circuitry that drive this. So some of it's hormonal, but a lot of it is the brain taking all this input that one has been exposed to, sun, earth, food, others social interactions, and starting to essentially throw the different paints, the different colors of paint together and just trying things. Some kids are more prone to this than others. Certainly has a hormonal component. Boys and girls tend to do this differently, but they both do it. And psychologists and neurobiologists see this as a fundamental shift in our underlying circuitry. So just a little bit of food for thought, to put what you just described in context with that said, tell us about wrestling."

They were into the road racing thing back in the day when it was brand new, you know, the eighties. I'm 48, so I was born in 75, so I was seven, you know, eight years old at the time. And I was into, like, obviously, can I win this race? I just. The pain of the effort was so comfortable, and then it's kind of silly, but, like, I won the PT competition at, like, the Boy scout staying in Audubon Park."

I mean, if someone said, what are you really in love with? It's. It's that. And so when I walked into the wrestling room, it was so extreme compared to anything else I had ever done. Football, baseball, whatever, I never really liked any of those sports. I played them all, but I didn't like them. And always, my dad wrestled in high school and college, and we were always rough and tumble in that regard. And I even have a couple of buddies in the teams who obviously were college wrestlers. There's a lot of wrestlers in the teams, and people would always joke about how we're so handsy, our hands are always on each other, and that was just a thing for us. I loved the close contact. I love the fight of it. What I really love about combat sports, cause I boxed in high school between wrestling seasons, was the respect."

And they respect the effort and because you know, what it takes and you know, how hard it is to face another man in the middle of a mat with no equipment and nowhere to run and no timeouts and no one to tap in. That's extremely, you know, and it may not seem like high school wrestling is extreme, but as you just mentioned, something about, you know, development when you're 14 and you're facing another, like, that's the first time. Is someone trying to take your life? No, they're not, but it feels that way. And then you go and you put in all these hours of training, and you don't eat during the week, and you run stadiums or you run levees and, you know, fireman's carries and all of it while you're not eating and making weight and you're in the sauna.

And for anyone, male or female, any age, who's interested in the human spirit, I recommend a fighter's heart because it's about the different fight sports, but it's really about the path of self discovery that occurs in various martial arts. And as you said, especially boxing is very gentlemanly. You touch gloves, you start, then the bell goes off, you go to your corner. Sometimes people lose it, bite off people's ears and things like that. But for the most part, the sport is very structured. As you were doing this, what was happening with school? Did it help your academic studies? Did it keep them more or less the same? And how did your family and your peer group view what you were doing? Were you considered strange for liking wrestling so much? I mean, you're dieting, you're a young male dieting for purpose of sport and performance. You're sitting in saunas, you're running wrapped in plastic bags. All this.

And I think I grew up, obviously, in New Orleans, and I think, you know, down there, it's baseball, football, basketball. Wrestling is not. I mean, I was lucky to wrestle in college at all because it wasn't like Iowa was looking to recruit me. You know, they have plenty of people to recruit and they don't need any Louisiana wrestlers. Although Daniel Cormier grew up, like, north of the lake. He was four years younger. I was telling this to somebody, we don't know each other. I'd love to meet him. Super impressive athlete. We heard that, hey, there's some kid up in the North Shore, I think is where he grew up, whooping everybody's ass. His name's Daniel Cormier. And then, you know, obviously the rest is history, but the sport is not big in Louisiana, which is all to say that we were kind of a unicorn. We had. It was very odd. At my high school specifically, we had one coach, his son, either national runner up, his name was Willie Gatson. Willie passed away. I think his son ended up at Iowa State, and within the last five or six years was either a national champ or a runner up. Willie. When I was in 8th grade, Andrew Willie was at my high school. Like, I have no idea how Willie Gatson ended up in New Orleans, but we ended up with this cluster of wrestlers at that time, with the right coaching, and a few kids were going to junior college and coming back and wrestling in college and coming back. And there were three or four guys. I remember specifically in 8th grade, because I started, at least in the junior high ranks, I started to take off my second year these guys would abuse me in the wrestling room. They were seniors in high school. I was 112 pounds or 132 pounds my freshman year, and they would just. In my 8th grade year, and they would just abuse me."

And a few of these guys would drag me down to the varsity end, and I would wrestle with the middleweights, and they would beat the shit out of me. And eventually you get to the point where you're like, fuck this, I have enough, you know? And that's when sort of things started to turn. But I think that wrestlers are different. And my peer group, one or two of my really good friends wrestled, but most of them played other sports, and so. But in every sense of the word, life got better for me because of that sport.

By now, most of you have heard me tell my story about how I've been taking ag one once or twice a day, every day since 2012. And indeed that's true. I started taking ag one and I still take ag one once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins and minerals that I might not be getting enough of from whole foods that I eat, as well as adaptogens and micronutrients. And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical because even though I strive to eat most of my foods from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods, it's often hard to do so, especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy. So by drinking a packet of ag one in the morning and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening, I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need. I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs. And I, like so many other people that take ag one regularly, just report feeling better. And that shouldn't be surprising because it supports gut health. And of course, gut health supports immune system health and brain health. And it's supporting a ton of different cellular and organ processes that all interact with one another. So while certain supplements are really directed towards one specific outcome, like sleeping better or being more alert, ag one really is foundational nutritional support. It's really designed to support all of the systems of your brain and body that relate to mental health and physical health. If you'd like to try ag one, you can go to drinkagone.com huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs with your order, plus a year's supply of vitamin d. Three, k, two. Again, that's drinkag one.com huberman so you're in Newport. Does that have a portal to the naval Academy?"

So there's two incredibly important people in my life in those early years at the naval academy. A guy named Doug Zembek, who's dead now, who most people of my service time will know who he is. When I was on my recruiting trip to the naval Academy and I was in high school, this is complete accident. Doug was a sophomore. We call him youngsters at the naval Academy. He was a sophomore, and we're the same weight class. So coach matched us up because it was my recruiting visit and my first. This is back to being wild. Literally, my first night on the grounds in the naval academy. I'm sleeping on Doug Zembek's floor of his room with his other two roommates. And sometime around three or 04:00 a.m. i get woken up. It's like a bomb goes off. There's a bomb. Didn't go off, but there's twelve other guerrillas in the room, all wrestlers, maybe one or two other guys. And Doug is hustling. I don't know any of these people, Andrew. Like, I just met Doug the previous evening. We just flew into town. He wakes me up. He's hustling me to get my shoes on again. I'm just this high school kid. And then within two to three minutes, all 15 of these gorillas bolt out of the room, and Doug grabs me, and I'm just following them, right? So we race out of Bancroft hall. It's maybe four in the morning, 334 in the morning. We race out of Bancroft hall, the barracks. We run across the parking lot. Into Lejeune hall, and Lejeune hall is the swimming facility and the wrestling room. That's it. That's the only thing that's in there, right? The doors. We run up to Lejeune hall. The doors of Lejeune hall are locked with a chain on the outside, and one of our Doug pulls on the chain so that the door is open enough at the top that the 142 pounder can climb up and, like, get inside that little gap in the doors and run over and open one of the doors that isn't chained."

In fact, there are so many exceptions to that. Or you have to be a natural athlete or be born with some genetic gift or some extra gear, as it were, in order to succeed. But I think so much of success is the thing that you seem to operationalize really quickly, which is to really focus on that 24 hours horizon. And where one has seen failure to just keep going, a big part of it is just to keep going, but also to make sure that you're continuing to go in a direction that is adaptive and functional. Because imagine, had you not found wrestling and you had gotten into some group where the metrics of success were around dealing weed or doing something which back then was highly illegal, now is varying levels of legality, but where the points came back for effort in domains of life that could take you down into the gutter, and you see this. So I'm convinced that the work ethic is the fundamental piece, but there has to be that rudder, and your rudder has to be pointed in the right direction. So along those lines, you meet Bridget.

You know, there's a. I probably wouldn't be sitting here today were it not for Eleni. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors. Plunge. Plunge makes what I believe is the best self cooling cold water plunge. Over the last decade, and especially in the last five years, there's been an increasing amount of excitement about cold water plunging for sake of mental health, physical health and performance. And that's in large part because one of the most robust effects of cold water exposure are big increases in adrenaline, also called epinephrine and dopamine. So while some people do cold water plunging in pursuit of increasing metabolism or reducing inflammation, it's really those big increases in adrenaline and dopamine that lead to those long lasting increases in alertness and feelings of well being, not just in the seconds or minutes after the cold plunge, but indeed, for several hours afterwards. I've been using a plunge for several years now, typically first thing in the morning or after cardiovascular training. I do agree that doing cold water plunging after a workout designed to generate hypertrophy or strength gains is not a good idea. But doing cold plunging at the other times of day can be tremendously beneficial. I use the version of plunge called the all in ice bath, and plunge now also makes saunas that get up to 230 degrees fahrenheit. I love how the plunge ice bath and sauna can both be controlled from an app on my phone so that if I'm headed home, I can turn on the sauna and it'll be hot when I arrive. So if you would like to try a plunge ice bath or sauna, you can go to plunge.com huberman to get $150 off either product. Again, that's plunge.com huberman.

As long as he came with me, I'd do it, no problem and enjoy it all the way down. Doug was going into the Marine Corps. I thought I was going to go into the Marine Corps. And I did a summer training in Quantico between freshman and sophomore year. And it was okay. It was good, but I didn't love it. And I met a couple other guys who were going to compete for spots in the SEAL teams who were years ahead of me. But to answer your question, junior year you can sign up and say, I want to start competing for a billet. We had 16 spots in my class. I think there's 32 spots these days. You know, the force has grown since 911, obviously. And I want to say maybe 150 or so people, they put you through this weekend overnight, two day. Hell, two day things. At Navy, some people quit. I don't know how many go to what we used to call mini buds. In the summer between junior and senior year, you go out to Coronado and Buds instructors, they still have it.

And then I'm just going to guess that goes from 150 to 80, maybe 80 guys go to the summer program in Coronado. When you're still a midshipman at the Naval Academy. I've never. Maybe people have quit mini buds, I don't know, but I don't know if I really saw anybody quit. The two weeks were out in Coronado, and then you get, you know, graded on your performance and stuff, and then you come back for senior year and you go through a series of interviews with a bunch of seals who come out and do interviews and you don't really know what you're doing. And then they select down. I don't want to, again, overdo it, but it's probably the seven. I don't know, maybe 50 or 60 qualified guys, they select you down to 16. And so to answer your question about when I got interested was when I knew I didn't want to go to the Marine Corps. I never ever had the top gun fever thing. I wasn't interested in flying. I just wasn't interested in anything else but something super physical. And that seemed like the best, the next best thing. And because I grew up in New Orleans and spent a lot of time in the water, that wasn't intimidating, that screens a lot of people out, obviously. Yeah.

Nothing correlated. And so I was a first phase OIC officer in charge.

And a couple other guys said, all this bullshit about this can get you through. That can get you through. I bet that every single person we talked to out here on the grinder has one of these three things. They were a varsity athlete in high school or college. Their parents are divorced, or they got suspended from school, I guarantee it.

But what you just described is really interesting. Let's break those three things down, because playing a varsity sport has certain elements. Having divorced parents has certain elements, and getting suspended in school has certain elements. Let's start with divorced parents first, because varsity sport, I think we can probably just quickly say, okay, there's structure. You have to listen to somebody. You have to be able to push yourself, have some level of physical competence, coachable mental competence, work with others. So there's something there, right? And you presumably have to go through junior varsity to get there. So there's some oomph required in any event. But the divorced parents piece is. What's surprising to me still, is you have divorced parents. So do I. Divorces occur for any number of different reasons. What in the world do you think is the. The consequence of, or a divorced household that would predict so well, at least in this back of the envelope measurement that you made, but as an instructor, that people would get through this excruciatingly difficult period of time for me."

The parents aren't necessarily divorced, and we're talking. Talking, of course, about trying to understand the human spirit, certainly not accomplishments per se, but the human spirit. So I think that a lot of people, especially nowadays, they look to their home life, and if God willing, they had a great home life, that is the base, it's the touchstone for them that they can return to. But for a lot of people, even people who go home for the holidays or who touch in with their parents, whether or not they're divorced or not, they don't feel like that family unit is really a solid thing. Maybe they're in a place, I see this a lot, where they're the parent. They had to grow up taking care of the parents. I see that a lot. On both the male side and the female side. I see that.

I know from my own experience, from zero three through 2010 was extremely intense. And obviously, the military has rules, and we need rules. And you follow the laws of armed conflict, and you follow the rules of engagement. There's no question about that ever. But the shit that happens to you out in the field, for real, does not follow any pattern. And so if you are a complete, you know, non suspended from school rule follower. I'm not saying you won't be successful. I'm sure plenty of people are. But in our line of work, if you ask people, most of them had a weird streak as they were coming up. Like, they have a little bit of a side eye when somebody tells them, this is how stuff is. Like, maybe it's like that, but you don't know that. And where it really became clear for me, Andrew, was, look at every stage in your development. You're still looking for what Wright looks like. And when I was a. I'm now a naval academy graduate. Not that that means anything special, but I'm smart enough. I'm now in my twenties, I'm at buds, and I have this recollection later, people are always telling stories about the teams. And when you're a new student at Buds, you kind of believe everything the instructors tell you because it's pretty impressive shit. And then you find out later when I checked into SEAL team three and you actually start to understand the arc of the job, it's like all these guys were telling training stories. Those weren't real combat stories. They never said that. That was a story from training. And so my point is, like, what? You hope guys are getting it now, but what we didn't get a lot of was the real story in a sense. Meaning, I will say definitively, my first combat deployment was zero three. When we invaded Iraq, I was a platoon commander. We invaded Iraq. And I remember within a week of being in that situation, thinking not one single instructor had the experience to mentor and coach me on this. Not one. And so you have to go back to that wild, suspended fuck you factor mindset, like all your silly rules about how the military works. None of that shit's happening out here. Like, all this other stuff is happening that doesn't have anything to do with your training manuals, except for the things you don't violate, which is to your best of your ability, stuff happens, but the rules of engagement and laws of armed conflict, everything else is a toss up. The tactics aren't. That's not a toss up, but you know what I mean. Like, the environment is completely chaotic."

And you meet people from World War Two and Vietnam and, you know, an amazing guy, which, you know, we can cover later. I don't. I wasn't around when he was coming up, but Colonel John Ripley is a guy who won the Navy Cross in Vietnam. The book, the bridge at Dongha, is about him. He knew my. This is back to my uncle Jim, who introduced. He and my uncle Jim were buddies, and I met him. He's since passed away. I met Colonel Ripley when I was a plebe at the Naval academy. I work with one of his sons now. Friend, teammate, mentor. Just a great guy, Colonel Ripley. He's a legend. Like, this guy's a Navy cross winner. Should have won the Congressional Medal of Honor, by all accounts. If you read the book, the Bridget Dong Ha, you are going to have no ability to understand why he's not dead. And these are the kind of people you meet. So back to the patriotism thing. By the time I was in the teams, I knew where I was sort of in this ecosystem. Admittedly, though, what I didn't really have, Andrew, because, I mean, I love the country, of course, but it wasn't. Again, I didn't grow up with a dad who was like, this was always in our house, or I. It just wasn't that big of a thing. This came for me after 911, obviously. But, yes, the patriotism and the importance of the jobs there. But when I remember checking into SEAL team three, what would emerge very quickly for me, because we had Vietnam vets in the training cell at SEAL team three and just some amazing people, what I realized right away was, okay, playtime is completely over. And that was very useful, like, early lesson. Not that anyone was fucking around in buds, like, you know, it's serious. But you meet a guy like Master chief Martin, who's got 100 combat missions from Vietnam. He's about to retire. He was like the third person I met when I checked into the team.

FAA regulations have you jump at 12,999ft because as soon as you go above 13,000, you have to use supplemental oxygen, which is not a huge deal, but it's a pain in the ass for the airplane to have it. And so 99% of your jump, all your jumps. Well, at any standard drop zone, your civilian jumps are going to be below 13 grand. For all of our jumping at SEAL team three is below 13 grand. It just makes the training more efficient. And you'll jump during the daytime, maybe a little night jumping. You probably have some lights for safety. And if you look out of the airplane, you would be able to see the orange tee on the drop zone. That's your standard jump profile. Maybe you'll jump with some weight. You'll certainly jump with your weapon, probably your helmet, but not all your jumps because you're bringing guys from zero to be able to do tactical military freefall as a group. When you go to the command, your jumps are from 25,000ft. You do 30 minutes of pre breathing on oxygen helmet, night vision, zero lights, an attack board that has your navigation system on it, 100 pounds of gear, your weapon, your oxygen, all your shit, and 45 dudes piled up in a c 17. And you drop miles away from the drop zone because your over ground speed at 25,000ft is hauling ass because of the wind. And if you take your hands out of your gloves at 25,000ft, it's curtains. Like, you're not going to be able to use your fingers because it's so cold. And you jump from way away, obviously, and all your jump is completely blacked out. Everybody turns ir lights on their helmets, infrared, infrared light, so you can see through night vision. And you got to fly that canopy multiple, multiple miles and land everybody on a drop zone. If you take every tactical thing we do and expand the same way you would expand free fall. That's the difference at the command, which is, look, I want to own this. When I was at team three, because you think about this, I had many, many moments where I was thinking, fuck it, man. Those guys aren't that much different. Like, we're. We're super high end, right?

At the one time, because I took some class, the navy had like 355,000 people, and that's the navy's end strength. And they have to distribute those numbers across everybody in the navy.

But on average, if I averaged out, because I've done this in excavating the last few years, we were at a funeral or memorial effectively every 90 days and in that time period. But it wasn't obviously that simple, like, for me and our family. Doug was my first super close teammate killed, and it wasn't in the teams, right. I'm now at the command. I was back from Afghanistan, from Kandahar. This is way before the marines built up 100 km west of Kandahar. We were operating, six of us with like 180 Afghans. Kind of the wild west back then. And Doug was killed that summer of zero seven. And I got a phone call from a friend. I was standing in my kitchen in Virginia beach, and it was like. Like the whole scaffolding of the world was just gone. Because at that age, and here I am like I'm some kid. I was in my thirties. But I'm thinking, you know, things get more and more serious as you go. Like at that time. But when Doug was killed and I was at Paul Berenice funeral and, you know, we came up to Annapolis, he was living in Annapolis. Cause he was working. It's now been publicly released, which is nice for Pam because she can talk about it more. He was working at the agency. And when after his funeral and just the days around that, and then I go back to work. And what I mentioned earlier about Doug and what I knew about him, just as an operator, he had been a company commander in Fallujah. He was on the front page of the LA Times. Like Tony Perry is a reporter in San Diego. He was in Fallujah following Doug. The guy was. And Doug is not a public people. People were just attracted to him to tell his story. I have so many stories that I heard later from his bosses, his regimental commander, you know, told stories about his unit in Fallujah, his sergeant major, and his amazing guy. I've talked to him about, like, what went on in Fallujah. Doug's just a fucking legend. I mean, he was awesome. And the dominant thought after his funeral was, if things. It's not that you don't think they're serious. And I mean, just about life, Andrew, it wasn't just about combat action and hard deployments. It was about, if Doug can be killed, all fucking bets are off. They're all off. Like, if I didn't respect the rules before and didn't think society was particularly ordered in a way that I respected, you know, shit that I think is made up. I knew when Doug was killed that it's all fucking made up. Like, he was supposed to be the immortal one, and if he's not, none of us are. Like, everything has to be reevaluated, you know?

There is a way to limiting probabilities. She'll swim in the ocean a little bit. But the point being that when you're in the military and your shoot, move, and communique is a big part of the job description, and the enemy is also taught to shoot, move, and communicate that there's a decent probability that you could die.

There is not a fucking human on the planet that was as tough and as focused and as hyper dialed in to how to do the job 100% effectively as he was. And it happened to him, you know, and I just never. It's almost embarrassing, Andrew, to say I never thought about it like that until Doug was killed."

Your mind became a weapon, right? Your body became a weapon. You were a weapon of the military from the inside out. And in the statement you just made encapsulates that. And that weapon honed itself for a long time. But then that's what the military is. It creates weapons out of humans. And I'm not demonizing the military whatsoever. I want to be very clear.

And then we went to Iraq in the winter of 0708, which was complete mayhem. And the troop was. I mean, my troop in the winter of 0708 were like fucking superheroes. And a guy named Tommy Valentine was the troop chief. And we got home and he was killed in a parachute accident. After all that shit we went through, Badger. A guy named Mark Carter was killed in that deployment. We got home and Tommy was killed in a parachute accident. And me and a guy named Dutch, we went up to Minnesota to notify Tommy's parents and his sister and his brother. And we're not. The Navy calls them keikos, like casualty assistance officers. These are jobs in the military where you're trained to do this stuff. You know, one of the things that's amazing about us is if a guy gets killed, we send a team guy there. But think about the team guy. Like, it's great for the family that you send the team guy, but we don't know shit about sitting with a family who's about to be notified that their son, in this case of Tommy, was killed. Britt went to Christina's house. Slab. Britt Slabinski. He went to Christina's house. And me and Dutch went up to Minnesota. And I'm shaking right now. Like, I was shaking the whole drive. We had to get to international falls all the way up north. The Valentines are incredible people. And, I mean, notifying a family was just. It was brutal. And so this is zero eight. And then it just keeps coming. It's Nate and it's Mike and it's Lance and it's extortion in 2011. And in the middle of that, Adam gets killed. Right?

We went through green team together. He was in a different squadron, though. So you sort of get separated a little. And I got a phone call in the middle of the night from one of my buddies who's still in, who is another legend. And I answered the phone, and it's midnight. I knew something was wrong, and we were kind of in this pattern then. And you're like, actually, a few of the commands were, like, our partner command and a bunch of other guys we work with in other units. It was a hard time.

You know, get your shit and come into the command because you got to do all this prep stuff. And I walked into the conference room. I mean, I remember it clear as day, Andrew. I walked into the conference room, and I could see it on everybody's face again. This is 2010 now. They were more terrified than I was. And these are civilian guys, guys who retired, who are now civilians. They work at the command and amazing people. And they looked like.

I don't know if it's a locust or whatever that sheds their skin. I literally, like, left a shell of myself on Kelly's front porch and walked out of my skin. It was. That was tough. That was tough. And so that was kind of the tempo, to answer your question. Like, it wasn't exactly every 90 days, but almost every 90 days from zero six to 2011 for me, I got out in the fall of 2011. It was memorial at the theater, memorial at the people's house, you know, and our neighbor across the street in Virginia beach, she lost her husband in zero seven. So one house over. So she was best friends with us. You know, you are trying to live two lives. You have this military life with all these consequences where every bone in your body is telling you to go full spartan. Like, no, not that the Spartans didn't have families, because they did whatever. Nothing else. Like, just cut off every other thing in your life completely. You have to go do this, and you have to do it full on, because clearly all bets are off. Like, we're barely making it through. We're losing our best guys, and how the fuck do I survive if at this pace? And so, because we're all in the same community in Virginia beach, you're around it all the time when you're home, and you should be, because you're supporting your teammates families, and that's important. But it was just. It's almost like a dream when I think about it now. How did we live like that? How does anyone live like that? And I know my experience as the military people go through all sorts of tough situations in different walks of life, but I have so much compassion for anybody who's trying to live in an environment like that where you are going on the next deployment. I mean, look, Andrew, we left Bockubun in zero eight before Tommy was killed. Three fucking weeks later, guys are getting blown up in the same area, and they got all the debrief from us. They knew exactly where to go. But it was just such a kinetic environment. It was almost like you couldn't stop it. It was just like the balls rolling. And when I think about people overseas and different situations that countries find themselves in right now, I can feel it for them. You know, what it takes. It's an intense environment."

I think years ago, you said to me, and this will be an important way of setting aside which side people are on, you know, whether or not you side with one group in the Middle east or the other, or you feel for everybody, that one of the things that you said that really rung in my ears for a long time is that the warriors on both sides, in their own minds, each and all of them, are just doing what they think is right for them and their families totally. You cannot erase that fact. Like, whether or not the government of this country or the government of that country or group was correct or incorrect, whether or not you're even talking about a terrorist cell versus a military, a formal military group or special operations group, that in the minds of the warriors, they're doing what they truly believe is right for them and their families and sometimes country as well. And when I heard that, it was sort of a. You know, it's sort of an obvious statement on the one hand, but it's a very important one, I think, to the psychology that, you know, everyone's fighting tooth and nail because they believe that they are right, or they're just fighting tooth and nail for whatever reason. And that was an important thing for me to hear. And I think about that a lot when I see any news stories about international conflict or terrorist, military conflict, terrorist civilian stuff, even people, there's something about the human brain.

And I think I was just by the same level of effort that we put into what we were doing, Bridget and every other wife, mom, at least the ones that I knew, they put that level effort in as well. It made our home life just very comfortable. So it was easy, like, I didn't have to go through some process, right? It was. This is how I remember it. It was easy for me. I don't know if it was easy for Bridget. She would have to answer that question. It was easy for me. And so I felt like, for the most part, like I was. I wasn't, like, platoon commander dad, you know, some movie, you know, the great Santini type dad. You know, I think Pat Conroy wrote the great Santini. His dad was crazy. Apparently, that's what he writes about. It wasn't like that. It was more of, this home is such a relief, and Bridget is so dialed that I don't have to. Unfortunately hard for Bridget. I don't have to do anything, you know, the time that I'm here, I can be here, and then, you know, go away again. And so it's, as we know, what trauma does to the mind. Like, there are many, many stretches of that time period that I just don't remember. And what I do remember is mostly, obviously, the fun times, the front yard, the whatever, playing with the boys, doing roughhousing and going on vacation and stuff.

And the heroes a thousand faces is effectively the 17 stage hero journey, which, by the way, George Lucas says, and has said many times publicly, he built the arc of Star wars around the 17 stage hero's journey. He credits Joseph Campbell's book for helping him. And if you ever read it or you go through the 17 stages or you see it or watch a short video, anybody, you'll see how damn near everybody's life, which is why it's called the monomyth. He describes it as the monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle. There's a little weirder term for it. But what he lays out in the book is, I don't know, maybe supposedly 2000 years of culture across multiple cultures. The book is incredibly complicated in that sense. Andrew, when I. So I listened to it audio first and then went back to it and listened to it in paper, I could not believe how a human could put this narrative together honestly. And so, but the summary, I struggle with the first ten stages a little bit, but I'll try to come back to them. If you look at the image when you lay out the 17 stages, the way it's in a circle is the ordinary world. And the extraordinary world is on the bottom of the page. There's a horizontal line. The diameter of that circle goes horizontally across. And the extraordinary world's on the bottom. The ordinary world's on the top. Let me talk about the back end of the journey first, because what I was mostly concerned about with when a friend pointed me to that book was my return to the ordinary world. And he told me, you, Coleman, you got to read this book. And so the back end of the hero's journey in the return section is three, four, seven stages of the 17. It's the ultimate boon, which is you learned something big in life. It depended on everybody learns something where you sort of realize that something big happened to me. That's the ultimate boon. And you have this incredible desire to do something with it. It's either knowledge or it's experience or whatever. And the ultimate boon you have, and you feel like this life thing. And then the next stage is typically refusal of the return. You really don't want to come back to the ordinary world because you feel that there is some level of consequence that maybe you can't handle or somebody."

And then the very last, stage 17, is freedom to live. And when you can, I'm going to give you my little pet theory in a second. When you can work your way through those stages, you can have the freedom to live.

It's either two worlds in one person, or it's two people trying to live in one world. But shit gets crazy, right? Because you just haven't done the cycle. And it sounds very miscalculated, but if you read here with a thousand faces. You're like, this journey is not new. Like, this is thousands of years of very typical human cycle. Now, if we go back to the top of the circle, let me try to scream through the first ten, which will be very obvious for Star wars fans. Just think about what Luke does. And I'm not like a super Star wars person. I've seen the movies, but it's a call to adventure. Most of us have a call to adventure of some sort in our life. Refuse the call. Help from a mentor. Crossing the first threshold, the belly of the whale, which is described as when you first truly separate. This was me leaving for college. When you first truly separate from the ordinary world road of trials, meeting the goddess, temptations, atonement with the father, apostasis, which is kind of like dying a death while you're still alive, and then you're into those return stages. And when I first read that book, andrew, I was like, I'm trapped in the return. I'm trapped somewhere in the return, just emotionally. And one of the places that I was absolutely trapped in the return was I didn't have the mentor to help me cross the threshold. I knew I had to move on in my life. I knew I had learned something extremely valuable. I knew that there was a way through because people across thousands of years of humanity have done it. I don't think I'm special, and I never had the mentor. I got mentors later, you know, a couple years out, and it reminds me that. So I got out in the fall of 2011, in the summer. One of my very good friends who lives in Connecticut, he works in New York. He brought me to a lunch at some fancy club in New York with a guy named Buddy Bucca. Paul Buddy Bucca, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was a West Point grad. He won the CMH in Vietnam. I've been around a lot of, you know, famous military people. Lunch was very normal, but Buddy was amazing. It was a normal lunch. We didn't talk about much, like, impact. We didn't talk about combat action or whatever. There was a green velvet set of stairs. We were leaving the club, the upstairs. We were coming down the green set of stairs. If I remember, Buddy's a little bit shorter than I am. He reached out his left. I was on his left. He reached out his left arm. I was a stare, one stare below him. He stopped me. I turned to my right to look at him. He looked at me. He said, son, you have it. You know that you have it. Pts, and you're gonna have to deal with it. And we left. I got in the cab and I left. And I remember thinking, you might have it, but I don't because that's the old days. Like, we were prepared for this shit. I was still convinced that I'm good. Like, nothing happened to me, nothing in the military happened to me. That's just normal stuff. And all of our training, it's a story I told myself. All of our training prepared me for that. Like this. The rest of my life is just gonna. Nothing bad's gonna happen because I'm good, whatever that meant. And when I started to learn more and read more and talk to people who were helping me, I remember Buddy telling me that. And back to those return stages. Andrew. It's just incredibly important for me to understand that my journey is not special. We are part of a long history of evolution that people who go through very challenging, and I mean, the 17 stages in Joseph could not be more accurate to like to my life, particularly the return."

I think you and I first got acquainted in somewhere around 2016 when you and some other folks from tier one community and related communities started coming to the lab. And my lab and I never really talked publicly about my lab has been involved with various things in Canada and the US. Not trying to create any mystique there, but it's not a point of interest what we did. But I recall at that time just thinking, like, this guy's just an amazing team guy, but in any event, you know, we got to know each other a bit. And my sense then was like, it's like a. It's kind of indestructible. Right? You know? And now I realize nobody's indestructible. We're flesh and bone. But. But if we may, let's fast forward a bit a couple years later, if you're willing to talk about it, maybe talk about some of the evolution that happened. So you started working a job. You're getting back into civilian life. And I recall a conversation about this time of year, probably about three years ago. Yeah. And you had done what a lot of vets from tier one operations have done and are now doing, which I actually have mostly favorable outlook on, which is now these are, I want to be very clear, legal and sanctioned explorations of the psychedelic space.

MDMA has been filed with the FDA as a potential treatment. It's not yet legal. These things have great power to heal in the right circumstances, and they also have great potential to harm in the wrong hands or circumstances. People with potential for psychosis, etcetera. But with that said, I remember I was driving. I was on a phone call with you around this time of year about three years ago. Maybe it was four, but I think it was three years ago. And I said, what was your experience with ibogaine DMT like? And you said, you know, it was among the most profound experiences of my entire life. And I recall you saying that you felt that it had connected you through time to all the warrior cultures that had preceded you. Not just us military, but all warrior cultures. And you sounded great. You sounded like, better than great. You weren't high, but you just sounded like man. Something had synced up and I thought, this is great. And I hadn't explored plant medicines, at least not in a long time, because I'd done the recreationally as a youth, which I do not recommend. It took me down a bad path, but more recently I've explored them in controlled conditions. But I thought, awesome, this works. You got this new job, you did some very controlled, and again, physician assisted Abigail DMT experiences, and you're telling me how great everything was. And then about. I think it was about three, four months later, I got a very different call. And if you're willing, I remember that call. Maybe you can tell me about that."

Actually, a bill just got passed in Congress that Dan Crenshaw helped spearhead to bring funding to the use of psychedelics for PTSD treatment in military. And I should mention. Cause this was interesting to learn that that bill was highly bipartisan. I'm not gonna name off the names. Cause if I do, there's gonna be a lot of cringing, screaming and yelling. But it's like if ever there was a bill that was supported from both sides of the aisle with the most diametrically opposed names who came together around that funding, it's that bill and just striking. So this is a very bipartisan thing. So I will say a number of people have been greatly benefited by the veteran solutions work, and we can't causally link what happened to you afterwards to that at all. There's a lot of contextual stuff, so we're not doing that. But we're an open book here. And I think that's a great group. By the way, veteran solutions is amazing.

You need to stabilize your situation, whatever your situation is, through some very slow, deliberate Doctor Conti level help. Because in the case of. I'm happy to see that some people are using just a wider spectrum of on ramp, not the nuclear option. To start, I can tell you unequivocally, abogaine and five m meo DMT two days apart is the nuclear option. And it's not right for everybody. I'm not a scientist.

That beautiful ice sculpture, perhaps at a person's wedding, and shattered it on the floor. And I was again left alone. My fault, not anybody else's left alone to figure out how to put that ice sculpture back together piece by piece. And my belief is I could have avoided that by having a much more deliberate process when suddenly the ice sculpture was on the ground. And every bit of intellect that I built over however long, four decades, I was flat on my back. And as I told you, Andrew, and I've been really verbal about, with so many friends who only want to talk about it in quiet circles, which I totally understand and respect. And if you want to talk about it in a quiet circle, like email, the humor, like podcast, and you can give them my cell phone number because I know how important it is to people when they're on that stage is that was another thing that I never thought was possible for humans. It was severe depression, severe. And I was so because I guess I just never thought about it again or never had a mentor. The shocking thing, Andrew, was how shocked I was. It was like if I had known something like this was real, not that I would have listened to anybody if they said it, but the most shocking thing was that again, this could happen to me. And when it did happen, I was completely unequipped to deal with. It took forget how weak, forget every other thing in my life. 10,000 x the energy of anything I've ever done in my life before. To just put my feet on the ground in the morning. I could not pt, I couldn't run. And you're like, I could not fucking function. I did function somehow to some level, but it was so terrifying.

I've never been to aa meeting, but the Simpson, the PTSD and the twelve steps, I'm like, oh my God, this is me. Like I need to go through these steps in my own way. Not for, you know, not for drinking, but for whatever. This low grade, the way I've described it as, you know, the Buddhists obviously call it dukkha, it's unsatisfactory ness. This low grade irritation that I carry around every day. The one amazing thing that that couple of months did for me and the way I described it visually is if someone cut me from neck to belly and filleted open my chest and took a propane torch and scorched me from the inside and then put me back together and said, start over, that's how it felt. That's literally how it felt. I mean, I could not believe Andrew, and you can obviously, you know, Doctor Conti can articulate this better. I couldn't believe how emotional pain could be so physically painful. That whole experience. Again, the shocking part was. The shocking part, I just didn't think it was real. And so then when it was, and I'm like, how many fucking things do I have to deal with, you know? And I realized everybody deals with a lot of stuff, and it was challenging, and then slowly, you know, it got better and better. And guys like, you know, friends, very close friends, a very, very small, tight group were, man, what people do when you finally tell them and you think, oh, this guy's gonna. He's never gonna talk to me again, they do the opposite. They rally immediately for you, you know, and then guys that aren't in your inner circle necessarily helping directly, and they're in the next circle. Cause now this is very weird. It's back to, like, the feeling thing. I can not 100% of the time, but a lot of guys in my community, if I speak to them and they're in a bad spot, I can detect it within 5 seconds. Just the tonal and kind of like the tempo. And when you tell that ring of people, not your super inner circle, they dump it immediately. As soon as you open the door, they're like, hey, man, I had a couple of tough, like, months, you know, boom, they're right in. For the most part, they open up. Yeah.

And thank you for highlighting the physical aspect of emotional pain, especially if one isn't accustomed to it. If one isn't accustomed to it, if you're willing. How bad did it get?

I've been right up next to it a few times. And now, if I ever see it, I know to do many things when it first comes into my visual sphere. The line, of course, being the point which one is considering taking their own life. Something that happens far too often, even once, as far too often. And we've sort of skirted around this topic. After all the wartime stuff and the gunfights and people dying and the doorbells, there have been a lot of friends of yours and some of whom I know, but most of whom I don't, but two this year who continue to kill themselves, to put it bluntly.

I actually was able to step like one of two things is happening. Either I am fundamentally bad, there's no way you can feel this bad and be good. So one of two things is happening. Like, I'm just bad, a bad person, which I know is not true, or something bad got inside of me that I have to get rid of, and I don't know how to get rid of it. And so sweating, shaking, you know, up at three in the morning and legitimately thinking this is just the scariest thing. And for anybody in the situation, you think with every ounce of your being that people are better off without you. And then somehow, thankfully, through chemistry, neurobiology, past learnings, I stepped back away from that very quickly. But the feeling of putting me up to that line didn't go away. I just intellectually was able to. It was kind of where the maladaptive behaviors, back to training work in your favor, which is, I'm not quitting. Like, this can't be just me. Even though it did feel like just. I mean, you suddenly become the core of the entire existence of the universe. You think like, you're it, you know, but in the negative side of it, not the adaptive side of it, because the pain is just so extreme and. But I was able to back away from it. And then over. I'm so grateful to so many of my friends. I can't imagine how many hours, if we collect up those hours, how much time I spent with them on the phone. And one of my. In the, like, in those really hard weeks, maybe a little bit after that injury, one of my buddies, I was actually just talking to him yesterday because I had time in the car. The tough love side of it when you're feeling that poorly is a little tricky. Like, I wouldn't. I probably wouldn't deliver tough love unless I really thought the person could handle it. I think it's. You got to really deal with kid gloves at those moments. But one of my buddies told me, if you do something to hurt yourself, you will have proven to every person who knows you that you are a fucking liar and a fraud. Everything you've been about your whole life is a fraud. And Andrew, I was, we were on the phone, I was like, whoa, my God. He just went ten ring. I mean, dead center. And that was a pivot.

It's such a sign of strength and skill, and it feels like the exact opposite in the moment. The exact opposite. And then we go to these narratives like, oh, if I've ever done that in the past, people didn't help. We come up with a million excuses but in the end, it's such a thing of strength to do that. So you did ratchet yourself out of that very, very dark hole slowly. And I want to place this in the context of this hero's journey. Would you see that? You talk about the magic flight against the refusal. You won't go back. So it was accepting, it seems that there was. That some pieces of you needed work, that there was this PTSD.

It nuked my memory at the dosage they suggested, which meant I had to take a very low dose. And then eventually I came off. And I think that that's one thing I learned from Conti, which is that most of these medications were designed to help people get over a bump, as opposed to be taken continuously.

Like, ultimately, if you look at people who commit suicide, and I've spent a lot of time with this literature, in almost every case in the preceding weeks, there's a disruption in sleep schedules, meaning disrupted from what they were doing prior to that, when they were not feeling suicide. So then you think about alcohol, disruption of sleep, even if you think you're sleeping and there's a story, like a common theme starts to emerge. So you stabilized sleep. You were getting some dopamine and noradrenergic assistance from the low dose robutrin, and you're basically also just offloading. You're just letting it all out with a therapist."

Like, I would have a fever that night, headache and fever. And I tend to get sick at the end of the year. Last two years, it was Christmas, this year it was Thanksgiving.

Michael Pollan, I think, quit coffee. And I was like, why the world would you do that? Yeah, why in the world? I love coffee. Love yerbra, mate.

Big end little things. Like, I don't. I try to just do my job and, you know, do a good job at it and hang out with my people, friends and family and all the extra shenanigans. Like I'll maybe do, you know, I was always doing some big race or some big mountaineering adventure, or I was just piling stuff into my schedule. I might do one race in the spring. Everything else is casual. Work really hard at it. I like cycling a lot. It's one of my favorites. And go hard.

One is where others are invincible, discovering that none of us are invincible, but that we are renewable. You clearly illustrate that there's clearly a message that everyone is gleaning from this many messages. But what, if any revision or adaptation do you think we need of the concept of being a man, growing oneself into a man? I'm not a gender studies sociologist, psychologist, neuroscientist. But setting all the sociology and the nomenclature aside, if you had a short list of things, like, seems like you believe that it's important to be able to do hard things, but sometimes those hard things are not the hard things that you aren't.

        "text": "They just. People seem to be so over activated over stuff. It's very odd. But for me, in my life experience, Andrew, it's range. Like, to use David Epstein's book title, right? It's range. And I've noticed this so much because of parenting and watching my boys grow into Mendez. If I think about. I'm gonna come back to range. If I think about myself at 17 or 18, not my parents, not my coaches, unless I really wanted it, you could not fucking tell me what to do. You can't tell me what to do now. Like, if I want it, I love the mentoring and the teammateship and the things that get you where you want to go, but if it's something I don't want to do, I'm not doing it, you know, no matter what. And so if I think about that in terms of being a dad or manhood is, let's take it back to my kids. Like, I think one of the most important parts of my job is to release the grip and take the reins off and just barely keep them inside the boundaries of alive, you know? Cause they're gonna make all their own decisions anyway, and they have to. Right? And so I think a big part that I see, and I saw myself a lot for years, was we overgrip sometimes, as men. Like, we are so afraid of losing control in an already uncontrollable world that we over grip everything, and I over gripped everything. And suddenly, when I'm not over gripping stuff, things are going better. And when it comes to range, it's okay for me, it's okay to have your tough guy moments, your fighter mentality moments. I would never want to lose that, because no matter how much help I get, when I'm out with my family or my wife or my boys, my head is on a fucking swivel, and if somebody touches them, it's curtains. And we need to keep that, because that is just a part of life. Like, you have to be. You cannot move through life with blinders on. Like, there are people who are not good people. And it's okay to have range and have that in your toolkit. What I don't think is okay to do is to let that slice of the traditional, whatever you want to call it, aggressive manhood, be your whole life. Like, that's just not functional. You know, it's not good for relationships. It's not good for parenthood. So every other little tool you can put in that toolbox that takes you all the way over here to what we might consider. Oh, Coleman's. He's soft now. No, no, don't mistake my kindness or weakness. There's a category for everything, and I think that makes you such a much more complete person. It's made me a more complete person. It's difficult. I feel like I'm brand new at being able to do other things in my toolbox like you. And I, like, this part's easy. I can go jump to that in a nanosecond. This part over here of normalizing life across whatever 80, 90 is. It's really hard to sort of excavate the normal shit. But that's what I think we need to do, you know? I mean, it's okay to be kind and calm and gentle and, you know, that's nothing wrong with that."

But a lot of what you're describing is surrendering to the realities of life that we can't control everything and just how painful it is to. To undergo that surrender. And here I'm talking to myself too. It's a process I'm still deeply involved in. As somebody who's tried to go rung over run as best I can."

That just tells me more about the evolution of our male system. Like, that part's so easy and this part is not so easy. But, man, it's a. It's a battle to remind myself, you know, slow down, listen. Just the basic shit. You don't have to go attack every problem like a fistfight. It's tough."

But for me, the more that God places me in circumstances that make the act of surrendering harder. Like, if I would just do it on my own, it wouldn't have to be so hard. I wouldn't have to. A good friend of mine, I'll mention my name, Tim Armstrong. He just said, like, you gotta hit every branch on the way down. You know, he was telling me I had to. You know, he's like, you're a stubborn punk rocker. You have to. And he was talking about himself too, like, there's certain. There's certain phenotypes where we have to, but. But the universe just screams out, you don't have to. You can actually just lower yourself down on a rope to the ground and then walk away. But then there's that stubbornness. But I think that the stubbornness has its evolutionary adaptations, too. And the hero's journey, nothing in the hero's journey says that the transitions between these different states are linear, are of equal duration, are of certainty only that they exist, and that there's no way, as you point out before, to skip steps."

And then I stepped away because I was exhausted, and I didn't know how to say it. I didn't know how to tell anybody. Like, I needed to escape again. Take magic flight somehow, you know. And he and I are incredibly close. Like, he was one of the guys who is in that super tight inner circle. And then I came back to it with a. With this team that I'm on. And I serve as the chief operating officer at Lids sports group the largest brick and mortar licensed sports retailer in North America. We have 2000 stores during the holiday. We have 8200 employees. And amazing team. The private equity firm that I work for is an amazing team. And the company is an amazing company and just incredible group of folks. And so, yeah, I work a lot. I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and LA and that's. It's all good. And I think I do those little things all day long, all the time. But no, I am not sitting on a mountaintop. Like, most days. There's no meditation at all, Andrew. It's meditation as a workout. Tom and I throw kettlebells around multiple times a week and I do those other little things. But the difference for me is I'm okay with it. And I say that because I was incredibly busy before when I first got out of the navy. And I wasn't okay with it because I thought, again, this is back to the hero's journey. I thought, like, the return to ordinary life was going to be sunshine and rainbows. Look, I have the ultimate boon. I had this big experience. Not that I wanted to be, like, front and center in the media but here I am. World. It's calm out here, right? Like, we get to chill and have a good time and sleep and nothing is stressful in the real world, right? Wrong. I just wasn't ready for that. Like, I really genuinely thought that it was just going to be easier. And so when we talk about the low grade pain injury and, like, you know, what is that? To me, that was one of the biggest frictions. Like, holy shit. I did all this stuff, all these deployments, lost all these buddies and there's no fucking rest. Like the regular world. It's supposed to be easier. At least that's the story that was in my mind going through all the stuff we just talked about. Now I'm okay with it. Like, I like it. I know how to manage my life. I know how to manage my time for the most part. I have a different relationship with my teammates and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life. And I love it. Like, I feel like I'm back to, in a very different way where I was when I was in the squadron back in zero seven. I feel like I'm on hope this doesn't get clipped. But for me, I'm on another level. Like, I really feel good about where I'm headed, and I haven't felt like that since I went into college. You know, I felt like shit was just deteriorating, and now it's. It's not, which is.

And I want to thank you for making it so clear as to what your experience was and being unafraid or perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway exactly what that felt like. Even better in that sense, and stepping into that fear, but also making it so clear that while your life experience is extraordinary, seal teams, tier one teams, all of it, that everyone's life has these components of extraordinary and the opportunity for extraordinary and return and renewal through the ordinary world. So much of what you shared has meaning regardless. People are male, female, young, old. So thank you for being a mentor today and for having the bravery for stepping out into the quote unquote ordinary world, which is oh so unordinary. And if you're willing, I think it'd be great to have you back in maybe a couple years and see where you're at. Meanwhile, you and I will be in touch often, as we frequently are. So thanks, Andrew."
