        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Doctor Matthew Walker as our guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. Doctor Walker is a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. There, his laboratory studies sleep. They study why we sleep, what occurs during sleep, such as dreams, and why we dream learning during sleep, as well as the consequences of getting insufficient or poor quality sleep on waking states. Doctor Walker is also the author of the international bestselling book why we sleep. Our discussion today is an absolutely fascinating one for anyone that's interested in sleep learning or human performance of any kind. Doctor Walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping. He also discusses naps, whether or not we should or should not nap, whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep, and if so, how to best do that. We discuss behavioral protocols and interactions with light, temperature, supplementation, food, exercise, sex, all the variables that can impact this incredible state of mind and body that we call sleep. During my scientific career, I've read many papers about sleep and attended many seminars about sleep. Yet my discussion with Doctor Walker today revealed to me more about sleep, sleep science, and how to get better at sleeping than all of those papers and seminars combined. I'm also delighted to share that Doctor Walker has started a podcast. That podcast, entitled the Matt Walker Podcast, releases its first episode this month and is going to teach all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping. So be sure to check out the Matt Walker podcast on Apple, Spotify or wherever you listen to podcasts. Before we begin, I'd like to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day, is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With athletic greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D three k too. There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin d three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element, and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium. But it has no sugar. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function, neuron function, as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body. If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized. If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low, we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise. Our mood is off, hormone systems go off. Our ability to get into physical action, to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished. So with element, you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element. That's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase. They're all delicious. So again, if you want to try element, you can go to elementlmnt.com huberman today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs. Mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still, but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations. And there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now my discussion with doctor Matt Walker. Great to finally meet you in person."

And also from the perspective of science, you actually came to Stanford a couple of years ago and gave a lecture for brain mind."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And there, of course, you talked about sleep and its utility and its challenges and how to conquer it, so to speak. Let's start off very basic. What is sleep?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Sleep is probably the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health. So that's a functional answer. In terms of what is sleep in terms of its benefits, sleep as a process, though, is an incredibly complex physiological ballet. And if you were to recognize or see what happens to your brain and your body at night during sleep, you would be blown away. And the paradox is that most of us, and I would think this too, you know, if I wasn't a sleep scientist, we go to bed, we lose consciousness for seven to 9 hours, and then we sort of wake up in the morning and we generally feel better. And in some Ways, that denies the physiological and biological beauty of sleep. So upstairs in your brain, when you're going through these different stages of sleep, the changes in brainwave activity are far more dramatic than those that we see when we're awake, and we can speak about deep sleep and what happens there. Rem sleep is a fascinating time, which is another stage of sleep, often called dream sleep, which is rapid eye movement sleep. That stage of sleep, some parts of your brain are up to 30% more active than when you're awake. So again, it's kind of violating this idea that our mind is dormant and our body is just simply quiescent and resting. So I would happy to just sort of double click on either one of those and also what changes in the body as well. But it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit and system. That said, though, I would almost push back against an evolved system. When we think about the question of sleep and what sleep is, our assumption has always been that we evolved to sleep. And I've actually questioned that, and I have no way to get in a time capsule and go back and prove this. But what if we started off sleeping and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged? Why do we assume that it's the other way around? And I think there's probably some really good evidence that sleep may have been the proto state, that it was the basic fundamental living state. And when we became awake, as it were, we always had to return to sleep. In some ways, at that point, sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness, and that's another way of describing what sleep is. But again, I think it sort of denies the active state of sleep. It's not a passive state of sleep either. And then finally you can say, what is sleep? Across different species, and in us, human beings and in all mammalian species and avian species as well, sleep is broadly separated into these two main types. And we've got non rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand, and then we've got rapid eye movement sleep on on the other. And we can speak about how they unfold across the night and their architecture, because it's not just intellectually interesting from the perspective of what sleep is. It's also practically impactful for our daily lives. And I'd love to sort of go down that route, too. But you navigate. You tell me I can."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Let's definitely go down that route. So you mentioned how active the brain is during certain phases of sleep. When I was coming up in science, REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, was referred to as paradoxical sleep. Is that still a good way to think about it? Paradoxical, because the brain is so active and yet we are essentially paralyzed? Correct."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it really is a paradox. And where that came from was simply the brainwave recordings that if all I'm measuring about you is your brainwave activity, it's very difficult for me, sitting outside of the sleep laboratory room to figure out, are you awake or are you in REM sleep? Because those two patterns of brain activity are so close to one another, you can't discriminate between them. Yet the paradox is that when you are awake, I go in there and you're sort of sitting up, you're clearly conscious and awake, but yet when you go into REM sleep, you are completely paralyzed. And that's one of the. I think that's part of the paradox. But the paradox really just comes down to two dramatically different conscious states, yet brain activity is dramatically more similar than different. And the way I can figure out which of the two you are in is by measuring two other signals, the activity from your eyes and the activity from your muscles. So when we're awake, we will occasionally have these blinks and we'll have sort of saccads. But during REM sleep, you have these really bizarre horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur. And that's where the name comes from. Rapid eye movements."

        "text": "Are they always horizontal?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Mostly they are horizontal. And that's one of the ways that we can differentiate them from other waking eye movement activity, because it's not always. It can be sometimes horizontal, but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plane. But then the muscle activity is the real dead giveaway. Just before you enter REM sleep, your brainstem, which is where the dynamics of non REM and REM are essentially played out and then expressed upstairs in the cortex and downstairs in the body. When we go into REM sleep, and just a few seconds before that happens, the brain stem sends a signal all the way down the spinal cord, and it communicates with what are called the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which control of voluntary skeletal muscles. And it's a signal of paralysis. And when you go into dream sleep, you are locked into a physical incarceration of your own body."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Why would mother nature do such a thing? And it's in some ways very simple. The brain paralyzes the body so that the mind can dream safely, because think about how quickly we would have all been popped out of the gene pool. You know, if I think I'm, you know, one of the best skydivers who can just simply fly. And I've had sometimes those dreams, too, you know, and I get up on my apartment window and I leap out, you're done, you're done, you know, so that's one of the sort of. That's part of the paradox of REM sleep. Both it's brain activity similarity despite the behavioral state being so different and this bizarre lockdown of the sort of brain, of the body itself. Now, of course, the involuntary muscles, thankfully, aren't paralyzed. So you keep breathing, your heart keeps beating."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "That's one of the reasons. Part of the other reason, though, there is because of the autonomic activity. So there is a part of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, and it controls many of the automatic behaviors, and some of those are aspects of our reproductive facilities during REM sleep. What we later discovered is that you go through these bizarre, what we call autonomic storms, which sounds dramatic, but it actually is when you measure them, that you'll go through periods where your heart rate decelerates and drops and your blood pressure goes down. And then utterly randomly, your heart rate accelerates dramatically. And what we call the fight or flight branch of the autonomic nervous system, or the sympathetic nervous system, badly named because it's anything but sympathetic. It's very aggravating that all of a sudden fires up and then it shuts down again, and it's not in any regular way. And it's when you get those autonomic storms, you get very activated from a physiological perspective, that you can have these erections and you have vaginal discharge, et."

        "text": "But you are still paralyzed. There are only two voluntary muscle groups that are spurred from the paralysis bizarre. One, your extra ocular muscles, because if they were paralyzed, you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye movements. And the other that we later discovered was the inner ear muscle. And we've got no good understanding as to why those two muscle groups are spurred from the paralysis. It may have something to do with cranial nerve, but I don't think it's that. I think it's perhaps something more sensory related. Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs are spurred from the paralysis is because if your eyeballs are left for long periods of time, inactive, you may get things such as oxygen, sort of issues in the aqueous or vitreous humor. And so the eyeballs have to keep."

So when I first fall asleep, I'll go into the light stages of non REM sleep, stages one and two of non, remember, and then I'll start to descend down into the deeper stages of non REM sleep. So after about maybe 20 minutes, I'm starting to head down into stage three non REM and then into stage four non REM sleep. And as I'm starting to fall asleep, as I've cast off from the, usually with me murky waters of wakefulness and I'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two, my heart rate starts to drop a little bit and then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down. Normally when I'm awake it's going up and down, maybe 2030, 40, 50 times a second. As I'm going into light non REM sleep, it will slow down to maybe 1520 and then really starts to slow down, down to about sort of ten or eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second. Then as I'm starting to move into stages three and four non REM sleep, several remarkable things happen. All of a sudden my heart rate really does start to drop. Oh, and I'll come back to temperature, I'm going to write temperature down because I always forget these things. Now I'm sadly in the foothills of middle age. So as I'm starting to go into those deeper stages of non REm sleep, all of a sudden hundreds of thousands of cells in my cortex all decide to fire together and then they all go silent together. And it's this remarkable physiological coordination of the likes that we just don't see during any other brain state."

So now I'm maybe 60 or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle, and then I'll start to rise back up, back up into stage two, non rem sleep. And then after about 80 or so minutes, I'll pop up and I'll have a short rem sleep period, and then back down I go again down into non rem. Up into rem. And you do that reliably? Repeatedly. And I will be doing that. And I do do that every 90 minutes. At least. That's the average for most adults. It's different in different species. What changes to your question is the ratio of non rem to rem within that 90 minutes cycle as you move across the night. And what I mean by this is, in the first half of the night, the majority of those 90 minutes cycles are comprised of lots of deep non REM sleep. That's when I get my stage three and four of deep non REM sleep once I push through to the second half of the night. Now, that seesaw balance changes. And instead, the majority of those 90 minutes cycles are comprised either of this lighter form of non REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep, and much more and increasingly more rapid eye movement sleep.

I have one question, which is you're saying that across the night, a greater percentage of these 90 minutes cycles are going to be occupied by REM sleep as you progress through the night. I'm aware that based on work that you've done and from your public education efforts and others, that we have so called circadian forces, and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to sleep, et cetera. Without going into the details of those, I have a simple question. The experiment is the following. Let's say, God forbid, you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time, and you stay up for the 4 hours or 5 hours that normally you would be in predominantly slow wave sleep. Let's say you finally get to lie down at 03:00 a.m. a, time when normally your sleep would be occupied mostly by rapid eye movement sleep. Will you experience a greater percentage of rapid eye movement sleep because of these so called circadian forces? Meaning that's what's appropriate for that time? Or will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that we're, as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep? Yeah, if that's not clear to anybody. Basically, what I'm asking is, if you are forced to skip the slow wave sleep part of the night, will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep, or does it have to start at the beginning and get slow wave sleep first? In other words, does one sleep state drive the entry to the next sleep state?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Great question. So there is some degree of reciprocity between the sleep states. I should note that when we drive one of those up, we often, but not always, see a change in the other. There are some pharmacologies that have shown an independence to that, and we've also played around with things like temperature, and sometimes you can nudge one and not seem to upset or perturb the other. But to your, I think, lovely point, the answer is it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter, meaning you will mostly go into your rem sleep phases and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep. So just because I start my sleep cycle at 03:00 a.m. rather than at 10:30 p.m. it doesn't mean that my brain just says, well, I've got a program and I'm just going to run the program. And the way the program runs is that we always start with a first couple of hours of deep sleep. So we're just going to begin act number one, scene one. It doesn't do that. Now I will get some deep sleep to begin with. And part of that is just because of how sleep works. Based on how long I've been awake, longer I'm awake, there is a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep. But we actually use exactly what you just described as an experimental technique to selectively deprive people of one of those stages of sleep or the other. So we will do first half of the night deprivation and then let you sleep the second half. So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived and you will still get mostly all of your m sleep. And then we switch it. So you only get your 1st 4 hours, which means you will mostly get deep non rem sleep, but you will get almost no rem sleep. So in both of those groups, they both had 4 hours of sleep. So the difference between them in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time because they both slept for the same amount. It's the contribution of those different stages. Now, we actually have more elegant methods for sort of selectively going in there and scooping out different stages of sleep. But that's the way we used to do it old school was just using this timing difference."

So, in other words, if I were to deprive myself. Deprive myself, excuse me, of REM, I would be hyper emotional, maybe not as settled with the kind of experiences of my life. Whereas if I had to have myself of slow wave sleep, I would feel a more physical malaise. Is that correct or is that far too simple? And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong."

It's almost a form of natural blood pressure medication. And so when I take that away from you the next day, we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction. We're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate blood pressure. We also know that during deep non REM sleep, that there is a certain control of specific hormones. For example, we know that the insulin regulation of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look from a regulated blood sugar perspective, versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look of profile? That's where deep sleep seems to matter. If we selectively deprive you of that, we see growth hormone is different, actually. So that's a beautiful demonstration where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent. And that's why we can come onto the effects of alcohol. And there's some really impressive, frightening data on alcohol and its disruption of sleep. But then we also know testosterone, peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep."

Sleep is just so pluripotent, it's so physiologically systemic, that it's almost impossible not to undergo one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation or just REM sleep deprivation, and not show a profile that you would have really prefer to avoid.

On any one of those grounds, sleep probably should have been selected against, but it wasn't. Sleep has fought its way through heroically, every step along the evolutionary path, and therefore every sleep stage has also survived. As best we can tell, what that means is that those are non negotiable. If Mother Nature had found a way to even just sort of thin slice some of that sleep from us, there would have been vast, I'm sure, evolutionary benefits.

That's perfectly normal. We tend to forget that in sleep science, we think of sleep efficiency. So of the total amount of time that you're in bed, how much of that percent time is spent asleep? And we usually look to numbers that are above 85% or more as a healthy sleep efficiency. So if you were to think about me going to bed and I spend, you know, let's say, eight and a quarter, eight and a half hours of time in bed, with a normal healthy sleep efficiency, I still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half hours, or seven and three quarter hours. Meaning that I'm going to be awake in total, not in one long boutan, but I'm going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes, net some time. Sometimes that can be after a ten minute dalliance after having gone to the bathroom, and I'm just gradually drifting back off again.

The other thing is, if it's happening very frequently, so even if you're not awake for 25 minutes stretches, but you're finding yourself waking up and being consciously aware that you've woken up for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night, and your sleep is very what we call fragmented. The great science of sleep in the past five or ten years has. Has been, yes, quantity is important, but quality is just as important. And you can't have one without the other in terms of a good, beneficial next day outcome. You can't just get 4 hours of sleep, but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired, nor can you get 8 hours of sleep, but have very poor quality of sleep and be unimpaired the next day. So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk this idea of, let's not get too worried about waking up and having some time awake. That's perfectly normal and natural.

It's really, you know, I view sleep as this period that feels good, but we're not aware of how it feels when we're in it, necessarily. It has tremendous benefits when you're doing it well, so to speak. And it has tremendous deficits when we're not. And I think. I think it was an important thing for you to do to cue people to this issue, and I would say mission accomplished, that people are aware of the need for sleep. I think that knowing that waking up in the middle of the night is normal, provided it's not too frequent, is great, and will also help people who may have been overly concerned about that. I do want to use this as an opportunity to raise something about the so called Uberman schedule, not to be confused with the Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one has confused those yet. Some years ago, there was a discussion about the so called Uberman schedule, meaning the Superman schedule. So that's Huberman without an h, which I have nothing to do with. If you read your nietzsche, this will have a subtext. But regardless, the Uberman schedule, as I understand, is one in which the person elects to sleep in 90 minutes. Bouts spread throughout the day and night in an attempt to get more productivity and or reduce their overall sleep need. There was a paper published recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us. Maybe you just give us the take home message on that."

You know, your. I sort of made it. I think it's almost like you're sleeping like a baby, you know, because that's the way that baby sleeps in 90 minutes, will sleep, that they will have, you know, these brief naps, then they're awake, then they're asleep, then they're awake. And to the chagrin of parents across the night, it's basically the same. They're awake, they're asleep, they're awake, they're asleep. And that's more the schedule that these types of protocols have suggested. And there was a really great comprehensive review that found not only that they weren't necessarily helpful, but they were actually really quite detrimental. And on almost every performance metric, whether it be task performance, whether it be physiological outcome measures, whether it even be the quality of the sleep that they were having when they were trying to get it all of those were in a downward direction. And it's not surprising if you look at the way that your physiology is programmed, if you look at the way your circadian rhythm is programmed, none of that screams to us that we should be sleeping in that way."

And my preference to exercise is probably sometime in the middle of the day, probably somewhere around 01:00 p.m. sorry, not 01:00 a.m. i, but I'm usually working out probably around the sort of seven, sort of 45, 08:00 a.m. time. That's usually when I'll start my workout. And there I start with cardio, spin, bike, facing a window. And luckily for the most part, here in California, there's usually sunlight coming through. But it doesn't matter to me because just as you said, even when it's a cloudy day that looks coming through of light, the intensity is splendid. So I would prefer to favor my exercise just because for efficiency, too, I want to get also working on the day. I'll try to match my exercise more with my circadian light exposure than I would probably if I'm going to. Do I really want to crush a workout or do I want to just, you know, make sure it's a good workout? I would prefer to work out at a different time, but I like that because of the daylight. And we can speak about exercise timing at some point because there's a lot of discussion around that when is the right time to exercise during sleep. And we can sort of bust some myths there, too. So I think you're spot on with the suggestion, get some morning daylight. Try to get that exposure usually at least 30 to 40 minutes. There was some great work recently coming out in the occupational health domain where they moved workers from offices that were just facing walls and, you know, didn't have any exposure to natural daylight. And then they did a time period during that study where they actually were in front of a window and working, and they measured their sleep and their sleep time, and their sleep efficiency increased quite dramatically. I'm forgetting the numbers now, but I think the increase in total sleep time is well over 30 minutes. And the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to 10%. And if you're batting an 80% sleep efficiency average, we're a bit concerned about that. But add 10% to that now you're in a great echelon of healthy sleepers, and all you did was just spend some time working in front of windows."

Caffeine is in a class of drugs that we call a psychoactive stimulants. So it works through a variety of mechanisms. One is a dopamine mechanism. Dopamine we often think of as a reward chemical. But dopamine is also very much an alerting neurochemical as well. And caffeine has some role, it seems, to play in increasing dopamine. But its principal mode of action, we believe, in terms of making me more alert and keeping me awake throughout the day is on the effects of adenosine. And to explain what adenosine is. From the moment that you and I woke up this morning, this chemical adenosine has been building up in our brain. And the longer that we're awake, the more of that adenosine accumulates."

Combusting energy and as they're combusting energy, one of the offshoots of that is this chemical adenosine. And so as we're awake throughout the day and our brain is metabolically very active, it's accumulating and building up this adenosine. Now, the. The more adenosine that we have, the sleepier that we will feel. So it really is like a sleep pressure, is what we call it. Now. It's not a mechanical pressure, don't worry, your head's not going to explode. It's a chemical pressure, and it's this weight of sleepiness that we feel gradually growing as we get into the eternity evening."

I mean, not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but for the aficionados and for myself, we have brain mechanisms like locus coeruleus, that release things, our brain areas, locuserulus just being a brain area, of course, that release things that proactively create wakefulness. So are those neurons shutting down as a consequence of having too much adenosine, or are there areas of the brain that promote sleepiness that are activated because these. You can imagine both things working in parallel. One or the other would accomplish the same endpoint."

But so the way that then caffeine comes into this equation, as I was saying, it's usually a kind of a linear process, or maybe it's probably closer to an exponential in terms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness. And we haven't really been able to measure that in humans because. Because normally it's hard to actually stick something into the brain and be sucking, siphoning off stuff every couple of minutes, as you could do in animal studies, and keep asking people every couple of minutes, how sleepy do you feel? How sleepy? And track to see if there's a linear rise in adenosine, which then creates an exponential rise in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are. But I'm nutting out. Caffeine comes into play here because caffeine comes into your system and it latches onto those welcome sites of adenosine, the adenosine receptors. But what it doesn't do is latch onto them and activate them, because if it was doing that, then it would, you know, in lots of ways, it would dial up more sort of sleepiness. It does the opposite. The way that caffeine works is that it comes in, competes with quite sharp elbows with adenosine, competitively, forces them out of the way, hijacks that receptor by latching onto it, but then just essentially blocks it. It doesn't inactivate the receptor, it doesn't activate the receptor. It functionally inactivates it in the sense that it takes it out of the game for adenosine. So it's like someone coming into a room and you're just about to sit down on the chair and caffeine comes in and just pulls out the chair, and you're like, well, now I've got nowhere to sit. And caffeine just keeps pulling out the chairs from adenosine and adenosine, even though it's at the same concentration in your brain. Your brain doesn't know that you've been awake for 10 hours, 16 hours at that point when you've downed a cup of coffee, because all of that adenosine that's still there can't communicate to the brain that you've been awake for 16 hours."

Different people have different durations of its action. But for the average adult, five to 6 hours, that variation, we understand it's down to a liver enzyme or a set of liver enzymes of the class that we call the cytochrome p 450 enzymes. And there are, I think last I delved into the data, which is pretty recently, there are two gene variants that will dictate the enzymatic speed with which the liver breaks down caffeine. And that's why you can have some people who are very sensitive to caffeine and other people who say, you know, I just doesn't affect me really that much at all."

So I have a cup of coffee. All of a sudden I was feeling tired, but I don't feel like I've been awake for 12 hours anymore, because with the caffeine in the system, maybe only half of that adenosine is being communicated through the receptor to my brain, 100% of the adenosine is still there. Only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain. So now I think, oh, I haven't been awake for 12 hours. I've just been awake for 6 hours. I feel great. Then after a few hours and the caffeine is starting to come out of my system, not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee several hours ago, it's that plus all of the adenosine that's been building up during the time that the caffeine has been in my system."

Because at nine or 10:00 p.m. if I stop drinking caffeine at, say, 06:00 p.m. and I crash, then I crash into a slumber, a deep night of sleep. Is that sleep really as deep as I think it is? Because given the half life of caffeine that you mentioned a few moments ago, I have to imagine that having some of that caffeine circulating in my system might disrupt the depth of sleep or somehow the architecture of sleep in a way that even if I get eight or who knows, even 10 hours of sleep, it might not be as restorative as I would like it to be."

That's the time when you should really stop using caffeine, is the suggestion. And the reason is because for those people who even just keep drinking up until into the evening, you're right that they can fall asleep. Fine, maybe they stay asleep. The depth of the deep sleep is not as deep anymore. And so there are two consequences. The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%, and for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%, I'd have to age you by between ten to twelve years. Or you can just do it every night to yourself with a couple of espressos. The second is that you then wake up the next morning and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep and I didn't have problems staying asleep, but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep. So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning rather than just two or three cups of coffee. And so goes this dependency cycle that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning. And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring them down because they're overly caffeinated alcohol, and we can speak about that too, also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well. So you're right that it's not just the quantity of your sleep or even difficulties falling or staying asleep, it can also be deep sleep. But here again, I think, you know, I don't want to be frightening people, and I mentioned this before, I think one of the real problems that I, or mistakes that I made because I didn't, you know, I'd never had much public exposure before the book. And I was so saddened by, you know, the disease and the suffering that I was seeing as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society and the fact that it wasn't really being discussed very much, I sort of came out, you know, a little bit headstrong, more than a little bit headstrong. And I think I was, you know, perhaps too, too much gas pedal and too little, you know, break, as it were. And I don't think that's the right way to approach health message within the public sphere. And I've become much softer in how I think about these things. I have ideas about what the ideal world looks like for sleep, but I also realize that none of us live in this thing called the ideal world."

I want to be faithful to the science, but I also don't want to go out and scare the living daylights out of people, particularly people who are struggling with their sleep, because it's probably only going to make matters worse. So I've been beautifully schooled by learning how to be a slightly better public communicator. I'm nowhere near of the standing that you're very elegant and it's very intuitive to you. I'm still with training wheels, but I'm getting a little bit better. But I just want to say that when I'm speaking about caffeine because it sounds as though I'm very sort of overt about it.

People needed to be cued to this. Thank you. I'll sleep when I'm dead. Mentality is one that I had. It's one that other people have. People in a huge number of vital communities, not just your students, but also people, the messaging that you provided and continue to provide has positively impacted the first responder community, the medical community. There's still steps that need to be taken, the military community, and of course, the civilian community. And so I think these adjustments about, yeah, caffeine's okay. Just restrict it to the early part of the day if you can. Most days, I mean, I think the law of averages, it's like the light viewing behavior. I think it is critical to view sunlight or natural, some other form of bright light early in the day. But if you miss a day, it's not that your whole system is going to dissolve into a puddle of tears. That'll happen on the second or the third day. No, I'm kidding."

We know this. And so I think the middle ground is often a hard place to achieve. So I think you've done a phenomenal job. But I appreciate you raising these points. And I think it's clear that we all need to, that we all can and should do certain things better, including being gentle with ourselves from time to time when we deviate from these ideal circumstances. Along these lines, I do want to talk about alcohol, because I think caffeine and alcohol represent the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum. Clearly, there are other stimulants. There are your adderalls and youre high energy drinks that people use. But alcohol and caffeine are the most commonly consumed stimulants and sedatives, depressants, as they're sometimes called. So what happens when somebody has a glass? We always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening or a cocktail after dinner or before dinner. How does that impact their sleep? And then we'll be sure to circle back in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior when it comes to avoiding alcohol or if it's age appropriate, et cetera. Enjoying alcohol."

And I think one of the first problems that people often mistake, alcohol is often used a sleep aid for people who are struggling with sleep, when things like over the counter remedies, et cetera, or herbal remedies have just not worked out for them. And alcohol, unfortunately, is anything but a sleep aid. The first reason that most people use it is to try and help them fall asleep."

It is a process, like everything in biology, and that that process involves in some way, as we talked about, push pull before turning off thinking, planning, et cetera, and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism, I have to imagine that these two things are knobs turning in opposite directions. That gives us this outcome we call falling asleep. Alcohol, it seems, is helpful for some people to turn off their thoughts or their planning. Is that right?"

And so I think if we look at the pattern of brain activity, if I were to place you inside an MRI scanner, where we're looking at the activity of your brain and what you drifting off, some parts of your brain will become less active, other parts will become more active. And this is the push pull model. It's inhibition, excitation. But alcohol is quite different in that regard. Alcohol is because it's a sedative. What it's really doing is trying to essentially knock out your cortex. It's sedating your cortex. And sedation is not sleep. But when we have a couple of drinks in the evening, when we have a couple of nightcaps, we mistake sedation for sleep, saying, well, I always. When I have a couple of whiskeys or a couple of cocktails, it always helps me fall asleep faster. In truth, what's happening is that you're losing consciousness quicker, but you're not necessarily naturalistically asleep any quicker. So that's one of the first sort of things just to keep in mind. The second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep. And we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important as the quantity. And alcohol, through a variety of mechanisms, some of which are activation of that autonomic nervous system, that fight or flight branch of the nervous system, alcohol will actually have you waking up many more times throughout the night. So your sleep is far less continuous. Now, some of those awakenings will be of conscious recollection the next day. You'll just remember waking up. Many of them won't be, and so. But yet your sleep will be littered with these sort of punctured awakenings throughout the night. And again, when you wake up the next morning, you don't feel. Feel restored by your sleep. You know, fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep in this alcohol induced way is usually not good quality sleep that you feel great on the next day. The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep, your rapid eye movement. Sleep and rem sleep is critical for a variety of cognitive functions, some aspects of learning and memory. It seems to be critical for aspects of emotional and mental health."

One of the most reliable signatures of just insufficient sleep doesn't have to be sleep deprivation. What we've discovered over the past 20 years here at the sleep center is that there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep is normal. And so I think that, firstly told us there is a very intimate association between your emotional mental health and your sleep health. But when it also comes to REM sleep, I think what's fascinating is that it's not just about your emotional health, it's not just about your hormonal health. We've also been seeing other aspects of cognition. But then there was a report, I think it could have been about two years ago out of Harvard. I think it was Beth Clearman's group. They found that and they replicated it in two different large populations. If you look at the contribution of different sleep stages to your lifespan, REM sleep was the strongest predictor of your longevity. And it was a linear relationship. It wasn't sort of one of these u shaped or j shaped curves that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk.

One thing, I don't wanna return to the notion of public health discourse too much, but I do wanna say one issue with books in general is that they can be revised, but it's more or less a one and done kind of thing until the next book comes out. One thing I like about the podcast format is that updates can be provided regularly, corrections and updates as new data come out. And so that's a wonderful aspect to this format, and hopefully the format that you'll be embracing. I think the world needs to hear more from you more often about sleep and its various contours, not less. So. I do have a question about drinking alcohol. Not that we want to promote day drinking, but let's say that the one or two glasses of wine or a cocktail is consumed with lunch, something that isn't traditionally done nowadays, or in a late afternoon, happy hour type cocktail, and then one is going to sleep seven or 8 hours later. Do you think that that will improve or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol? Or if you have a drink, are you basically screwed for the next 24 hours?"

And is it linear, or is it nonlinear? Is it such that only when you drink in the last 4 hours do you just hit this exponential and it's bad, bad, bad. Or is there some other curve that we could imagine?

This is a discussion that I think five years ago would have ventured into the realm of illegal. But now, in many places, not all medical marijuana is approved or is legal, and certainly it's in widespread use, certainly not recommending people do it. I have my own thoughts about marijuana, CBD. I've been fortunate, I suppose, that I don't particularly like marijuana or CBD. I don't even know if I've ever tried CBD. First of all, does marijuana disrupt the depth of sleep, the architecture of sleep, and if so, as with alcohol and caffeine, does when you ingest it or when it's in your bloodstream, does relative to when you go to sleep? Does that play an important role so does marijuana disrupt sleep?"

We've got THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, and we've got CBD. And CBD is sort of the less psych, what we think of as the non psychoactive component. In other words, when you take CBD, you don't get high. If you take THC, you can get high. That's the psychoactive part of the equation."

But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature of your falling asleep with and without that THC, it's not going to be an ideal fit. So you could argue it's non natural. But many people use THC for that fact because they find it difficult to fall asleep. And it can speed the onset of at least non consciousness, I guess is the best way of describing it. But there are problems with THC and there are two fold. The first is that it too, but through different mechanisms, seems to block REM sleep. And that's why a lot of people, when they're using, will tell me, look, you know, I definitely, I was dreaming. I don't remember, you know, many of my dreams. And then when they stop using THC, they'll say I was having just crazy, crazy dreams. And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism. REM sleep is very clever. And alcohol is the same way in this sense. It's the same homeostatic mechanism. Some people will tell me, look, if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol, you know, maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning and I'll just have these really intense dreams. So. And I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep. Well, the way it works is that it's during, in the middle of the night, really, when alcohol blocks your REM sleep and your brain is smart, it understands how much REM sleep you should have had, how much REM sleep you have not because the alcohol has been in the system. And finally, in those early morning hours when you're getting through to sort of, you know, six, all of a sudden your brain not only goes back to having the same amount of rem it would have had, it does that. Plus it tries to get back all of the REM sleep that it's lost. Does it get back all of the REM sleep? No, it doesn't. It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries. And so you have these really intense periods of REm sleep. Hence you have really intense, bizarre dreams. And that's what happens also with THC. You build up this pressure for REM sleep, this debt for REM sleep. Will you ever pay it back? Doesn't seem as though you get back everything that you lost, but will you get back some of it? Yes. The brain will start to devour more because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long. But one of the bigger problems with THC that we worry about is withdrawal dependency. So as you start to use THC for sleep, there can be a dependency tolerance. So you start to need more to get the same sleep benefit. And when you stop using, you usually get a very severe rebound, insomnia. And in fact, it's so potent that it's typically part of the clinical withdrawal profile from THC, from cannabis."

And maybe indeed, they don't actually follow the profile of classical addiction. I don't know. I'm guessing some do, some don't. But if you ask them, well, what if I took away all marijuana consumption for, I don't know, two weeks? That thought scares many of them, and many of them will experience intense anxiety without marijuana, which speaks to perhaps not addiction, but a certain kind of dependency. And again, I know many pot smokers, some of whom have jobs that are quite high performing and they manage here in Berkeley."

Not of the nature necessarily that we see with THC, but the devil is a little bit in the details from the data that we do have. And it comes onto your validity point of purity. At low dose, CBD can seem to be wake promoting. So in lower doses, let's say sort of five or ten milligrams. I'm trying to remember some of the studies off the top of my head there. It actually may enhance wakefulness and cause problems with sleep. It's only once you get into the higher dose range that there seem to have been some, you know, increases. Sorry, increases in sleepiness or sort of sedation like increases. And that's usually, I think, above about 25 milligrams as best I can recall from the data. And then when we look in animal models, you typically see the same type of profile too. So then the question becomes, and now, again, you just don't know about purity. It's very difficult. Although I think I, and again, I'm not a user, not necessarily because I have anything against it. It's just that. Not necessarily my cup of tea. There are some firms that are now doing third party independent laboratory tests. I don't know how gamed that is. So I've got no sense."

But if it ends up being that CBD is potentially beneficial for sleep, how can we reconcile that? Mechanistically. And I think there are to me, at least. There are at least three candidate mechanisms that I've been exploring and thinking about. The first is that it's thermoregulatory. And what we found in some animal models is that CBD will create a profile of hypothermia. In other words, it cools the body, the core body temperature down. And that's something that we know is good for sleep. The second is that it's an anxiolytic, that it can reduce anxiety. And that data is actually quite strong, even with some functional imaging work that's been coming out recently showing that one epicenter of emotion called the amygdala, deep within the brain is quiet and down with CBD. So I think that's at least a second non mutually. That's great. That's an exclusive possibility. I think the third is some recent data that's come out that was suggesting that CBD can alter the signaling of adenosine. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you produce more adenosine, but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity, perhaps, of the brain so that the weight of that same adenosine is weightier in its brain signal and therefore it creates this stronger pressure for sleep. So I think these are all tentative mechanisms. I think any one of them is viable. I think all three are viable together. But right now, I think, does that sort of help think through the tapestry of THC and CBD?"

And actually it's a perfect segue from, we've talked about caffeine, alcohol, THC and CBD as sort of, we framed them anyway, as things that, done in moderation, at the appropriate times, are probably okay for most people, certainly not for everybody. There will be differences in sensitivity, but that done at the incorrect times and certainly in the incorrect amounts will greatly disrupt this vital stage of life we call sleep. CBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge to the topic I'd like to talk about next, which is things that promote more healthy sleep or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture and quality of sleep. So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grant, the original, I should say that not the granddaddy, but the OG of sleep supplementation, which is melatonin, the so called hormone of darkness that's inhibited by light, et cetera, frame for us, melatonin in the context of its naturally occurring form. And then I'd like to talk about melatonin, the supplement. In my experience, anytime I say the word melatonin, people think about the supplement melatonin which in itself is an interesting phenomenon that people are so cued to its role as something you take, we often forget that this is something that we make endogenously. I'd love for you to comment in particular on, even though without necessarily getting into precise nanograms per deciliter values. What are the typical amounts of melatonin that we release each night? And then I'd like to compare that to what is contained in, say, a three milligram or six milligram tablet that one might buy at the pharmacy. So I go to sleep at night. Has melatonin already kicked in before I shut my eyes and lay down my head?"

So let's say that you look at hunter gatherer tribes who aren't touched by electricity, and so they're sort of the puritanical state par excellence when it comes to electric light influence. And usually it's as dusk is approaching, that's when melatonin will start to rise. And so when you lose the brake pedal of light coming through the eyes, that normally acts like a hard brake pedal that stamps down and prevents the release and production of melatonin, as that light brake pedal starts to fade with dusk, then we ease off the brake pedal and melatonin, the spigot of melatonin is opened up and melatonin starts getting released. And usually we'll see this rising peak of melatonin sometime, usually an hour, 2 hours later, or around. And it varies from different people around the time of sleep itself, but it's already been on the march for some hours before you actually hit sleep itself."

So in most adults, the average adult, I should say, your biological clock, normally runs a little bit long. It's about 24 hours and 13 minutes, I think, was the last calculation. But the reason that we don't keep drifting forward in time and kind of running consistently more later and later. 30 minutes by 30 minutes. By 30 minutes each day, is because your central brain clock is regulated by external things, such as daylight and temperature, as well as food and activity. All of these are essentially different fingers that come along. And on the wristwatch of the 24 hours clock will pull the dial out and reset it each day to precisely 24 hours. And I make that point because it knows 24 hours time, but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body the 24 hours time as well. And one of the ways that it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of 24 hours nuss of light and day using this hormone, melatonin. And when it is at low levels or it's non existent, it's communicating the message. It's daytime, and for us diurnal species, it says it's time to be awake. Yet at nighttime, when dusk approaches and the brake comes off, melatonin and we start to release it, then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body. Look, it's dusk and it's nighttime. And for us dienal species, it's time to think about sleep. So melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body when it's day and when it's night and with that when it's time to sleep, when it's time to wake. And therefore that's why melatonin helps with the timing of the onset of sleep, but it doesn't really help with the generation of sleep itself. And this is why we'll come on to what those studies of supplementation have taught us."

Sadly, the evidence in healthy adults who are nothing older age suggests that melatonin is not really particularly helpful as a sleep aid. I think there was a recent meta analysis that demonstrated, when it looked at all of the different sleep parameters, melatonin and a meta analysis for those not knowing what that is, it's a scientific sort of method that we use where we gather all the individual studies and we put them in a big bucket and we kind of do this kind of statistical fancy sleight of hand, and we tried to come up with a big picture of what all of those individual studies tell us.

Let's not, again, be sort of completely dismissive of that. How could it have that effect? One of the reasons that I've become a little bit more bullish on melatonin from a sleep perspective, and then melatonin more generally. For a. Maybe we can speak about this too, as a counter measure when you're undergoing insufficient sleep. There are two different routes there. The first reason that I think it could have a sleep benefit for some people is not because it helps in the generation of sleep. We know that it doesn't.

And that's why it's always easier to fall asleep in a room. That's too cold than too hot. I think that that's one potential avenue that we are considering thinking more deeply about when it comes to melatonin. And then the other is melatonin as an antioxidant. But let me table that for now, because I'll just get us sidetracked. That's what we know so far about melatonin in terms of its supplementation benefit or lack thereof.

As a consequence, they tend to have a flatter overall curve of melatonin released throughout the night. It's not this beautiful, lovely peak and this bullhorn message of it's darkness. Please get to sleep. That's why older adults can have problems falling asleep or staying asleep. It's not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination, but it's one of the reasons. And it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts, older adults, and especially older adults with insomnia, people have thought about that as maybe an appropriate use case."

And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare the typical amount that someone would supplement? Typically the supplements for melatonin that I see in the pharmacy and elsewhere and online range anywhere from 1 or even 20 milligrams. My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin, typical for somebody in their twenties, thirties, forties, would be far lower than that. Am I correct or wrong?"

And of course, if you're a supplement company, you know, putting ten milligrams versus five milligrams if that's what you're actually doing, which we'll speak about purity as well. You know, it's kind of like the super gulp size. You know, nobody wants to lower price, they just want you to, you know, we'll just give you more for the same price and that's how we'll compete. So it's been this escalating arms race of melatonin concentration and it really does not look meaningful for, you know, for sleep in any way. What we've actually found is that the optimal doses for where you do get sleep benefits in the populations that we've looked at are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin. In other words, the typical doses are usually ten times, 20 times, maybe more than what your body would naturally expect. And this is what we call a super physiological dose. In other words, it's far above what is physiologically normal. And to put that in context, imagine I said to you, I want you to eat 20 times as much food today."

It would be terrible, and yet you can do this. One thing that I'm concerned about, about these supraphysiological levels of melatonin is that many years ago actually, here at Berkeley, when I was a graduate student, we would inject animals which were seasonally breeding animals with melatonin. And the consequence of that was that their gonads, either their testes or ovaries, would shrink many hundredfold or more. In other words, they would go from having nice, healthy sized hamster testicles, what a hamster would consider healthy size for a hamster, and they would shrink to the size of a grain of rice. So from an almonds to a size of a grain of rise. I had to see that only once for me to be very concerned about super physiological levels of melatonin. And I realized that melatonin does different things in different species. We are not hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders, seasonally restricted breeders. There might be more breeding during certain seasons, I don't know those data. But nonetheless, hormones are powerful. And sure there is an optimal. And sometimes we see that going slightly above endogenous levels for certain, hormones not always can have beneficial effects, and sometimes it can have detrimental effects. I'm just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone that has effects on the reproductive axis. And that's one of the reasons why I get very concerned when I see people really getting aggressive about melatonin supplementation taking 110, 500, sometimes even 10,000 times the amount that we would normally release. That's my concern. Although it's not nested in any one specific human study. I just. I just don't like to see. I certainly don't want to see other people, and I don't want to personally take a hormone that's known to be androgen suppressive at high levels. Why would I take that?

I think it was at least over 20 different brands of melatonin supplements. And what they found is that based on what it said on the bottle versus what was in the capsules themselves, it ranged from, I think it was 83% less than what it said on the bottle to 478% more than what it said on the bottle. Now, if that's a ten milligram, you know, pill, and it's 478% more than ten milligrams, and we're already at ten milligrams at many tens of times more than is a physiological, rather than a supra physiological dose, we do need to be a bit thoughtful."

Well, and I do appreciate the deep dive on melatonin, because I think people need to understand that it's nuanced, it's a matter of dosages and timing, etcetera, and that it may have its place, as you mentioned, in older individuals. And I should mention that I'm an avid consumer of supplements that I believe in for me, and I have been for a very long time, so I'm by no means anti supplement. Some supplements I refuse to take or avoid taking. Others I quite avidly take. And along those lines, I personally, and I don't know what your thoughts on this are, but there are a few things that I've personally found beneficial. I'd love your thoughts on them, and I would love it if you would tell me that everything I'm about to refer to is placebo. That would be fine. So that's what we do. We're scientists, we argue, and then we remain friends, as it goes always. So magnesium, there are many forms of magnesium. Magnesium citrate is as we know is a terrific laxative. Magnesium malate seems at least from a few studies, seems to relieve some of delayed onset muscle soreness. Doesn't seem to create a kind of sedation. Two forms of magnesium that I'm aware of, magnesium biglycinate and magnesium threonate. Yeah, we believe based on the data can more actively cross the blood brain barrier. So you put it in your gut, but some of that needs to get into your brain in order to have the sedative effect. What are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation? Do you supplement with magnesium? And what studies would you like to see done if they haven't been done already?"

And the reason that interests me is because the sleep is by the brain of the brain and also for the brain as well as for the body. We just don't have a particularly good set of studies that have targeted exclusively threonate. We do have lots of studies that have just looked at magnesium in general for sleep. And overall the data is uncompelling."

So I started looking back into the literature and I've best traced it at least as far as I can tell, to early studies showing that those who were deficient in magnesium also had sleep problems. They had other problems too, of course, but sleep problems were one of that set of sequelae that came from having lower magnesium. And when they supplemented with magnesium and tried to restore those levels, some of those sleep problems dissipated. And then that seems to have gotten lost in some game of sort of like whispers around the room. And it's become translated into people who don't have sleep problems, who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general and who have healthy normal levels of magnesium. If they take more magnesium they will sleep better. And the data really there is not good. Once again, the only study that I've seen where magnesium did have some efficacy was in a study with older adults. I think they were 60 to 80 years old. It may have been exclusively women. Now I think about it, and they also had insomnia. And in that population you did see some benefits. And my guess is that because it's an older community as well, they were probably, probably deficient in magnesium. So they fit the former category of simply when you're deficient and you restore, you can help sleep sort of return to normal. But if you are not deficient and you're healthy and you're not old and you don't have insomnia, and you're supplementing thinking that it provides sleep, right now, the data isn't supportive of that, but I just don't think we have enough threonate data to actually speak about that because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue so far with the other forms."

But to isolate the real effect, one needs to do some more refined studies. What are some things that are of interest to you, if not things that you happen to take?

And then I think there was the most recent study, I think, looked at two different doses of Filarian, I could have this wrong, and they just failed to find any effects once again. But the stunning part of that paper, as I recall, they had this big table with all of the different sleep metrics that they looked at, and there were well over 25 different things that they tried to see if Valerian impacted. And none of them were significant, which stuns me, because from statistical probabilities, we know if you just randomly perform 25 statistical tests, chances are probabilistically you'll just get one significant result by random chance.

So I went to the literature, just started reading as much as I could about it, and there were three really good randomized placebo crossover trials with tart cherries.

It's just that it decreases the amount of time that some people were taking to sleep during the day and giving it back to the night. But that wasn't the case, because if you added the total amount of sleep that they were getting without tart cherries, both naps and nightly sleep combined, still, when you took tart cherries, you still got a net sum benefit of total amount of sleep. So, you know, so far, when it comes to supplements and those types of studies, they're good studies and the data looks interesting. But as a drug itself, you know, if this was clinical drug, three studies that are somewhat small in nature and have some positive benefit, that's what we would call preliminary data of maybe a chin scratching kind."

Some people, their threshold is quite high. I feel like, you know, there are two categories, or at least two categories of folks out there. People who hear, oh, tart cherry can improve sleep and we'll run out and try it, and people who hear, well, that sounds crazy, why would I do that? But of course, we have to remind people that tart Cherry isn't really what we're talking about. Presumably, if this is a real effect, and it sounds like it might be that there's a compound in tart cherries that if we were to call it whatever, whatever, five alpha six, some molecule, if we referred to it by its technical name. Then people would say, oh, that sounds like a very interesting technical way to approach sleep, but doesn't sound very natural. So both groups are a little bit misguided in the sense that people who think that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods, plants, et cetera, things that grow out of the ground, that that's all safe, that's not true. And people that think that pharmaceuticals are the only. If it's not evidence with the purified molecule, then something's not of utility. Well, that's certainly not true. Somewhere in the middle, I think, lies the answer, which is it sounds to me like tart cherry is at least an intriguing potential sleep aid. Intriguing potential sleep aid and underscoring potential. I'm certainly intrigued by it to the point where I might experiment a bit, but I'm an experimenter for myself. Before I ask you about Kiwi, I've had quite good results from taking something called apigenin, which is a derivative of chamomile. But in supplement form, I take 50 milligrams about 30 minutes before sleep, and I subjectively experience a better night's sleep, so to speak. I don't measure, I confess, I don't measure my sleep. I'm not a sleep tracker guy, but there are a few papers out there. They're not what we would call published in blue ribbon journals, but they have control groups. And it looks somewhat interesting. When I say apigenin, people get somewhat intrigued. Oh. This molecule, chamomile, has long been thought to be a sedative, a mild sedative, but a sedative. Do you drink chamomile tea? Do you take apigenin? What are your thoughts on apigenin?"

Right now, from best I can tell, it's mostly subjective data rather than objective, hard sort of sleep measures. And that's why right now it's sort of unclear. Not no comment, but just unclear, not dismissing it. Because I think you and I both ascribe to the idea of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. So keep your mind open. At least I tell that to myself. I think if you're finding a benefit and you can do what I would think of if I was personally experimenting, which is both the positive and negative parts of the experiment. What I mean by that is, let's say that I now want to think about some kind of a sleep supplement. I will take some kind of baseline set of recordings for a month and I will just gauge where I'm at supplement free. Then I'll go on for a month to whatever I'm thinking of taking and I don't supplement, let's say that I want to and I experiment with that. And I feel as though based on my metrics, be them objective from my oura ring or be them subjective from whatever I'm, you know, writing down in the morning. And both are important, valid subjective and objective. We like both in the sleep world. And I think, okay, look, it's clearly that it seems to have some kind of an effect. The key thing, however, is then do the negative experiment, which is now come off it for another month and see do things get worse? And if I can see that bi directionality, then I am starting to think maybe I'm believing this a little bit more.

And as you mentioned, this potential mechanism via the GABA system we both, as scientists, get excited about mechanism because when you can trace a mechanism in a pathway, it provides a rationale, a grounding for why kiwi of all things, or tart cherry of all things, might help increase total sleep time. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention or ask about tryptophan and serotonin. I can anecdotally say when I've taken tryptophan, the precursor to serotonin or serotonin itself, I have a horrendous night's sleep. I fall asleep very easily, and I experience ridiculously vivid dreams, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It's kind of a mishmash. And then I wake up and I experience several days of insomnia. And I've done the positive control and the negative control and all the variations thereof to confirm that, at least for me, supplementing with serotonergic agents is a bad idea for me. And tryptophan is a common sleep supplement and sleep aid that's discussed. The normal architecture of sleep involves the release of serotonin, but in a very timed and regulated way. What are your thoughts about serotonin in sleep if you had to kind of put that into a nutshell, and then why supplementing with serotonin and or its precursor, tryptophan, might be a good or a bad idea for somebody."

So I'm always thoughtful when you're playing around with that mother nature dynamic, as it were. The data, as you described, is a little bit all over the map. Some people say that it knocks them out. Other people say, just like you do, it has a terrible impact on my sleep. And when I stop, it's pretty bad for a couple of days. It seems to have this lingering after effect. I think what could be happening here is we need serotonin to, just as you described, be modulated in very specific ways during the different stages of sleep. If you look at the firing of the brain epicenters where serotonin is released, and there's a bunch of them in the brainstem, what you find, and the release of serotonin, too. When we're awake, it's usually in high concentrations. As we start to drift off to sleep, it lowers some, but not necessarily dramatically, as we're going into non REM sleep. But then when we go into REM sleep, serotonin is shut off. One of the other neuromodulators, noradrenaline, also shut off. REM sleep is the only time during the 24 hours period where we see noradrenaline and serotonin or norepinephrine completely shut down. When I say serotonin, we're also talking five htp. Sorry, five ht. That's just its chemical name here. So whether it were speaking about serotonin or five ht, it's the same thing. Norepinephrine, noradrenaline, both of those need to be shut down for you to produce REM sleep. One of the other neuromodulators that then ramps up to produce REM sleep is acetylcholine. So these three neuromodulators have this incredible reciprocal dance that they have for you to generate what is called a natural architecture of sleep throughout the night."

I take a 20 or 30 minutes napkin, or I do a practice, which I took the liberty of coining NSDR, non sleep, deep rest. Some sort of just passive laying out there, feet up, elevated. Sometimes people do you or I'll do yoga, Nidra. I'll do hypnosis or something of that sort. But 20 or 30 minutes of that has been very beneficial for me. To get up from that nap or period of minimal wakefulness, we'll call it and go about my day quite well and also fall asleep just fine. What are the data on naps? Do you nap, and what are your thoughts about keeping naps short, meaning 20 to 30 minutes versus getting out past 90 minutes, 2 hours? So, for you personally, naps, yay nay or meh."

I definitely feel as though there can be this kind of after null afternoon lull where, you know, I'm not quite as on as I was at 11:00 in the morning. And we know the physiology to that, which brings us back to whether we were designed to nap. So for naps, we've done lots of different studies, and other colleagues have done these studies, too. Naps can have some really great benefits. We found benefits for cardiovascular health, blood pressure, for example. We found benefits for levels of cortisol. We found benefits for learning and memory, and also emotional regulation."

        "text": "After the first hour of waking up, I'm just not the best version of myself. So we wait for that time period, and then we do some testing, and we've done some testing before and after, and we look at the change, and that's how we measure what was the benefit of naps and the reason why we sometimes do 90 minutes, so that they get all of those stages of sleep. And then we correlate. How much benefit did you get from the napkin and how much of that benefit was explained by what REM sleep you got, what deep sleep you got, what light sleep you got. So that's the only reason that we use that as an experimental tool. What we've also found is that naps of as little as 17 minutes can have some quite potent effects on, for example, learning. None of this is novel. NASA pioneered this back in the 1990s, and during the missions, they were experimenting with naps for their astronauts. And what they found was that naps of little as 26 minutes improved mission performance by 34% and improved daytime alertness by 50%. And it birthed what was then called the NASA nap culture throughout all terrestrial NASA staff during that time period. So it's long been known that nap's going to have a benefit. Naps, however, can have a double edged sword. There is a dark side to naps, and it comes back to our story of adenosine and sleep pressure. The longer we're awake, the more of that sleep pressure, adenosine that we build up. But what I didn't tell you is that when we sleep, the brain gets the chance to essentially clear out that adenosine. And after about 16 hours of wakefulness, and then after about 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of sleep seems to be able to allow the brain to decrease its adenosine levels back to normal. And so naturally, we should start to wake up, which also aligns with your circadian rhythm. And those are two separate processes. But with about 8 hours of good quality sleep, seven to 9 hours for the average adult, we are free of all of that adenosine. We've evacuated it essentially out of brain, and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed. The reason that naps can be potentially dangerous is that when you nap, you are essentially opening the valve on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure, and some of that sleepiness is lost by way of the nap. So for some people, and not all people, and you're a great example of this. Some people, however, if they are struggling with sleep at night and they nap during the day, it makes their sleep problems even worse. So for people with insomnia, we typically advise against napping. And the advice is, if you can nap regularly and you don't struggle with sleep at night, then naps are just fine. But if you do struggle with sleep, stay away from naps. If you are going to nap, try to limit your naps. Try to cut them off a bit like sort of caffeine, maybe, you know, eight to sort of 12 hours, maybe, not that, you know, far off, maybe sort of seven to 6 hours is a good rule of thumb. Try not to nap, essentially late in the afternoon. And if you do take a nap and you want to maintain your, you don't want to have that grogginess hangover that can happen after a full night of sleep for the first hour, try to limit it to about 2025 minutes. And that way you don't go down into the very deepest stages of sleep, which I, if I wrench you out of with an alarm, then you just kind of feel. You almost feel worse for the first hour after the nap."

If I oversleep, certainly if the sun goes down during my nap and I wake up and light overall lighting conditions have changed, I find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening, and it can screw me up. So I try and keep those naps pretty brief. And I should say I'm very happy to hear you mention individual differences and why some people might want to nap and other people might not want to nap. I have a colleague, Leech and low. He'll be familiar to many neurobiologists, but who's an absolutely spectacular scientist, member of the National Academy, Howard Hughes investigator, just phenom and has a ton of energy. But years ago, I learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon. So much so that when he travels to give seminars at other universities, he will tell his post lunch host, whoever it is that he's supposed to meet with, may I have your office for 30 minutes of our sometimes 30 minutes discussion or 60 minutes discussion? Because I like to take a nap. And he does that and then gives. His talks are typically in the afternoon in academic culture, and he describes the effect of the nap for him, these short naps in the afternoon being so profound for his productivity. That's actually what inspired me to start feeling okay about my desire to nap. And so I think, for me, that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap. But I take to heart your note about avoiding naps if you have trouble falling and staying asleep, because I think that I have family members who also, if they nap, they're a wreck. They can't sleep."

It's where people have either a very high sleep need or they are very sleepy during the day, and they're typically falling asleep. And these can happen in a variety of different clinical contexts. One of the places where we've often seen hypersomnia believed to manifest is in depression. But if you look at some of those studies, it turns out it looks more as though those people are simply reporting being in bed longer, but not necessarily sleeping longer. And that fits very well with one of the profiles that we know of depression, which is anhedonia. You don't get pleasure from normally pleasurable things, so you just don't want to go out into the world, you don't want to interact because you're depressed. So what do you do?"

The mistake made in that question is, okay, that's how much time they're sleeping, when you should have said, what time did you fall asleep and what time did you wake up? And the answer could be very different. So that's hypersomnia from a clinical context. Can you sleep too much? Though? One of the data points that argues, yes, that's possible is when we look at all cause mortality, certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot of seven to 9 hours, when you start to drop below 7 hours, there is a relationship which suggests that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Short sleep, in that regard, predicts all cause mortality. But it's, again, not a linear relationship like the one that we've seen with REM sleep. Once you get past 9 hours, the mortality curve stops going down. And then once you get further ten or 11 hours, it hooks back up again. It's almost like a j shape tilted over a little bit and reversed. So there's this strange hook. What's going on here right now? Sleep science has at least two non mutually exclusive explanations for this. The first is that if you look at some of those populations, the idea is that the whatever was causing them illness and took their lives was just too much for sleep to deal with. However, we know that when we get sick, one of the things that we do immediately, and there's a whole mechanism, an inflammatory mechanism, cytokine mediated. When we get sick, we want to sleep more. We just want to curl up in bed and sleep it off. So the argument there is that it's not that sleep was killing people prematurely, it was that these people were calling on the help of sleep. They were calling on this thing called the swiss army knife of health, that is sleep. But whatever it is that they were facing was just too powerful for sleep to overcome. So it artificially looks as though more sleep leads to a higher risk of death, when sleep was actually responding to the mortality risk and it lost the battle. That's one argument. The second is that we know that sleep quality and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor of all cause mortality. And when you look at people who often report sleeping long amounts, ten or 11 hours, they typically report having very poor quality sleep. So because their quality of sleep is poor, they just try to sleep longer to try and get some of that back. So again, here now, it's poor quality sleep masking as too much sleep, leading to this artificial huck, which looks like mortality. That's a second explanation. A third, which is more of a geduncan, which is just kind of like a thought experiment. And I'm of this mentality. I don't know how many other people share this. I actually think there could be a thing as too much sleep. Physiologically, I think it's possible. But the reason I think that is because it's no different than food, water or oxygen. Can you overeat? Yes, you can. Can you undereat? Of course."

Can you get too much oxygen? Hyperoxemia. And it can cause free radical damage, which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells. Can you sleep too much? Which is the fifth element of the life equation alongside food, water, oxygen. So fourth, I should say, can't even count. Clearly I'm sleeping well. Yes, I think there could be that possibility.

So what I'm coming away with is that there are many paths to this and both positive and things to avoid, but the idea is to get most nights a similar amount, probably seven to 9 hours, somewhere in there, of high quality sleep, that this notion of sleep quality is going to become, I would hope, a phrase that more people think about and learn about and cultivate as a practice. I want to ask about a set of behaviors that I'm aware of. At least one company is starting to track in their sleep monitoring device, and that's orgasm and sex. Orgasm and masturbation.

I am so, so tired, but I can't fall asleep because I'm too wired. So your sleep drive, you're desperately tired, it's there. But because you're wired, because you've got too much sympathetic activation, too much cortisol as well, you can't fall asleep. It's an impressive roadblock to anything like good sleep. And it's one of the principal mechanisms that we now believe stress and physiological activation, that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia. But coming back to sex, the data is actually quite compelling that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality or objective amount of sleep sex that has resulted in orgasm. And I think it's that latter part that typically needs to happen, I would imagine so that, you know, so between two mutually exclusive individuals where both are, you know, beneficial in terms of receiving an orgasm."

So here we're talking about whether sex can help with sleep. Can sleep help with your relationship and sex? And the answer is yes, it can.

We know this particularly from evidence in shift working women, where they are nighttime shift workers, they struggle with sleep during the day. Often menstruation is disrupted or even becomes impaired. But we also know it works this way not just for sex hormones, but for sex itself. For example, we found that for every 1 hour of sleep, extra sleep that a woman gets her interest in becoming sexually intimate with her partner increases by 14%, which is a non trivial amount. And then the final part of, I think, this equation, when it comes to sleep and sex, is your relationship itself. And there was some great work here from UC Berkeley by Professor Serena Chen. And what she found was that restless nights mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship. And they did this in a number of different elegant ways, and vice versa as well."

And I went into the data, which spans many decades, actually, both animal studies and human studies, and it seems, just to underscore this, as long as we're talking about this subject, that it does seem that sexual activity, sex between two people, does seem to increase testosterone in both. There is this question about orgasm or no orgasm, ejaculation, no ejaculation. And indeed, there do seem to be some effects of restricting ejaculation in males as a form of further increasing testosterone. So sex without ejaculation, further increasing testosterone. But the data are not clean, presumably because organizing these sorts of studies and getting truth in self reporting is probably hard to get from. From subjects. But everything sort of points in the direction that, provided that the relationship is a healthy one. It's consensual, it's age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate that sex between two individuals does seem to increase the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen toward healthy ranges. And what I'm hearing now, the sort of gestalt of the discussion we just had, is that that too can promote sleepiness, restful states and quality sleep. And I think this is an important conversation that just hasn't been held enough. I mean, sooner or later, both in the US and elsewhere, we're going to have to acknowledge that we are biological organisms of some sort and that we have choice in life about all these things from supplementation to sex or no sex, et cetera, but that they have profound effects on our core biology. I mean, it's fascinating to me that the areas of the hypothalamus, the preoptic area, the super optic areas, those areas which the names might not mean anything to anybody besides Matt and I sitting here, but those areas sit cheek to jowl with each other in the hypothalamus and control sleep and sex, the trigger of orgasm, the appetite for food, the appetite for water, for electrolytes. I mean, the hypothalamus is kind of a, a festival of neurons with different booths for different, such a primitive behavior."

Or maybe you do things or you think about things just in a purely exploratory way as a scientist, the what if kind of things that what if it turns out that, and I hear I've got a blank there for you to fill in."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think beyond the standardization, you know, fur that I've dished out plenty of times of sleep, hygiene, of, you know, regularity, temperature, darkness, alcohol, caffeine. And we've spoken about all of those. What are some more unconventional tips? I guess the first one, which is unconventional, along the lines of naps. If you've had a bad night of sleep, let's say that you're starting to emerge with insomnia and you've had a bad night of sleep. The advice, and I learned this from my wonderful colleague Michael, do nothing. What I mean by that is don't wake up any later. Don't sleep in the following day to try and make up for it. Don't nap during the day. Don't consume extra caffeine to wake you up to try to get you through the day, and don't go to bed any earlier to think that you're going to compensate. And I can explain all of those things, but if you wake up later, you're not going to be sleepy until late in the evening. So you're going to go to bed at your normal time and you won't be sleeping. You'll think, well, I just came off a bad night of sleep and now I still, I can't even get to sleep and it's my normal time. It's because you slept in later than you would otherwise and you reduce the window of adenosine accumulation before your normal bedtime. So don't wake up any later. Don't use more caffeine for the reasons that are obvious, because that's only going to crank you and keep you awake the following night or decrease the probability of a good following night of recovery sleep. Third, I mentioned don't take naps because once again, that will just take naps, particularly later in the afternoon. I almost liken them to snacking before a main meal. It just takes your appetite off the edge of that main meal of sleep. So don't do it. And then finally, don't go to bed any earlier. Resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time. What I want to try and do is prevent you from thinking, well, I had such a bad night last night and I normally go to bed at 1030, I'm just going to get into bed at 09:00 because last night was just so bad. But that's not your natural bedtime and it's not aligned with your natural chronotype because presumably you kind of know something about that. Or a morning type, evening type. You're trying to sleep in harmony, which is usually the how you get best quality sleep. But you go to bed at nine and my body is not ready to sleep at 09:00 but I'm worried because I had a bad night of sleep last night. So I get into bed and now I'm tossing and turning for the first hour and a half because it's not my natural sleep window. But I just thought it was a good idea and if I didn't know anything about sleep I would think all of these same things too. So I'm not finger wagging. But after, if I have a bad night of sleep and I am not immune, just because I know a little bit about sleep doesn't mean I don't have my bad nights. I do. Doesn't mean I haven't had bouts of insomnia in my life. I have. But after a bad night of sleep, I do nothing. I don't do any of those four things. I think the second tip I would offer in terms of unconventional is have a wind down routine. Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light switch that we just jump into bed and when we turn the light out, sleep should arrive in that same way. Just the binary, you know, it's on or it's off. Sleep is a physiological process. It's much more like landing a plane. It takes time to gradually descend down onto the terra firma of what we call good solid sleep at night. Find out whatever works for you and it could be light stretching. I usually meditate for about ten or 15 minutes before bed. Some people like reading. Try not to watch television in bed. That's usually advice."

        "text": "Much light too activating. You can listen to a relaxing podcast, although we can speak about technology in the bedroom too, but have some kind of a wind down routine. It's almost like you wouldn't race into your garage and come to a. A screeching halt from 60 miles an hour. You typically downshift your gears and you slow down as you come into the garage. There's the same thing with sleep, too. So that's the second thing. Have some kind of a wind down routine. Find what works for you. Maybe it's taking a hot bath or a warm shower and then stick to it. We do this with kids all the time. We find out what their bedroom, sorry, their bedtime regiment is, and then we just stick to it faithfully because we humans are the same way, too. The third thing is a myth. Don't count sheep. There was a study done here at UC Berkeley. I didn't do this today. I wish I did. It was by my colleague, Professor Alison Harvey. And they found that counting sheep actually made it harder to fall asleep. It made matters worse. As a counter measure to that, what they did find was that taking yourself on some kind of a mental walk. So think about a nice walk that you take in nature, or a walk on the beach, or even a walk around an urban environment and visualizing that that seemed to be beneficial. The other thing about sort of that idea of shifting focus away from your mind itself, get your mind off itself, is a good piece of advice. Catharsis. You can try to write down all of the concerns that you have and do this not right before bed, but usually an hour or two before bed. Some people call it a worry journal. And to me it's a little bit like closing down all of the emotional tabs on my browser because if I shut the computer down and all of those tabs are still open, I'm going to come back in the morning, the computer's red hot, the fans going because it didn't go to sleep, because it couldn't, because there were too many tabs active and open. I think it's the same way with sleep as well. So try to think about doing that. So just vomit out all of your concerns on the page."

And when we have those thoughts at night, it comes with a magnitude of rumination and catastrophization that is disproportionate to that which you would describe when you are awake. And I don't know what's going on about the brain and thought and emotion at the time. I've got a bunch of theories as to why, and that's why I like the idea of closing up, zipping up all of those different components, just get them out on the page, and it feels. And I at first thought, this just sounds like hooey. It sounds very berkeley. It's kind of come by our, we all hold hands and walk home at the end of the day. But then the data started coming out really good studies from good people, and they found that keeping one of those journals decreased the time it takes you to fall asleep by 50%. 50. Amazing. Well on par with any pharmaceutical agent."

I'm glad that you might decide to eventually look at this in your laboratory, because I feel like something is melted away or altered. I suspect it's in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system that it makes sense why a concern at ought to evoke more of a panic sense than a concern sense. And certainly that's my experience, although I'm fortunate to not suffer from full blown panic attacks. But everything seems worse at provided you're awake."

So now, I don't know if that's causative or not, but something, you know, it could just be that that's the time when we're mostly lonely and we're by ourselves, and that's the reason. So it's got nothing to do with sleep or the nighttime. I don't know. So that's the third thing, I think the fourth sort of little tip I would give that's unconventional, is remove all clock faces from your bedroom, including your phone. Including your phone, and resist checking it. Now, I know, and I can speak about the phone, too. That genie of technology is out the bottle, and it's not going back in anytime soon. So we've got to think as scientists and sleep scientists as to what we do with phones in the background."

So try to remove all clock faces.

Tremendously fun for me to dissect out this incredible aspect of our lives that we call sleep with a fellow scientist and a fellow public educator, I want to say several things. First of all, we should say where people can find you. Although it shouldn't be that difficult these days, you're very present on the Internet. Unfortunately, for better or for worse, I think it's wonderful that you're out there. Look, it's a public health service that you're doing. No one requires you or any other scientist to get out and share this information. My sense of you, knowing you a bit and from following your work very closely, both your scientific work in detail and your public facing educational work, is that you very much want the best for people. And it's an interesting thing as a scientist or a clinician to know that certain answers exist, that we don't have all the answers, but that there is a better path, there are better ways, and people can benefit in a myriad of ways. So for that, because I know that to be very genuine in you. You want the best for people, and you're offering tremendous advice and considerations, and people can take it or leave it.
