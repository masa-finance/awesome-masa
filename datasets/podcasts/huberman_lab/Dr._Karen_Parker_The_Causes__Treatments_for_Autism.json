        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Doctor Karen Parker. Doctor Karen Parker directs the Social Neurosciences research program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The goal of her laboratory's research is to understand the biological basis of social functioning at any every stage of the lifespan. So this includes the bonds that form between infant and parent or parents, as well as the bonds that occur between children as they grow up, which of course form the template for social functioning when we become adults. Doctor Parker's research is heavily focused on autism and indeed on all forms of autism spectrum disorders. Today, we discuss autism. We talk about the prominent theories and current understanding of the biological basis for autism, as well as what still remains mysterious and unresolved about the causes of autism. You may have heard that the incidence, or perhaps just the diagnosis of autism has dramatically increased in the last ten to 15 years, and today we discuss why it is in fact that the incidence, not just the diagnosis, but the incidence of autism, has so dramatically increased. And perhaps most excitingly, Doctor Parker shares with us brand new research findings from her laboratory that point to a new understanding of what causes autism, as well as a novel treatment for autism. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com hubermandhe. Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's Wakingupdaily to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with Doctor Karen Parker. Doctor Karen Parker, welcome."

But I'm very excited because the topic of autism is one that is on a lot of people's minds. And I think the first question that always comes up, it seems, is whether or not the frequency of autism is indeed increasing, or whether or not the field of medicine is getting better at detecting what was always there over time. Do we have any clear answers to that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I think it's a multifactorial answer, so we're getting better at detecting autism. In the past, we were diagnosing kids at nine or ten years of age. Clinicians are able to reliably diagnose kids at two to three years of age. Right. So there's more people. There are, pediatricians have autism screeners now. So when you bring in your baby and over the first couple years of life, you're filling out screeners that are looking for autism symptoms. Right. So there's just a lot more awareness around autism. But the rates have increased to now one in 36 us children have a diagnosis of autism, which is over two years ago it was one in 45."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's a great question. So autism is male biased and prevalence. So you have, and again, the studies vary. I mean, it's worth noting that autism is a highly clinically heterogeneous disorder, which means that if you've met one kid with autism, you've met one kid with autism. Right. So we have to bear that in mind as we have this conversation. But, you know, different studies show that about, for every one girl, there's three to four boys that are impacted by autism. So there's, you know, differences in the prevalence rate and also there's different monitoring sites. So the way in the US that these data are generated is the CDC has eleven monitoring sites across the country. And so they, they follow children and then that's where we, that's where the prevalence rates come from and they release new prevalence rates every few years."

        "text": "So if physicians are able to detect autism early, say, in a two year old or a three year old, to imagine that they're working off of tests that don't rely heavily on language, because even though you can get some verbose two and three year olds, most two and three year olds don't have a very extensive vocabulary. And I'm guessing that they're also relying on things like visual gaze, among other things. We've already made clear that this is not a discussion to allow people to diagnose themselves or others. But with that said, what are some of the diagnostic tools that people use? Is it language? Is it vision? Does it present as abnormal auditory processing? Maybe you could give us a sampling."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So autism is a behavioral diagnosis, unlike other areas of medicine where you might be able to take a blood test or there's other sort of tools, it's all a behavioral diagnosis by an expert. So usually a psychiatrist or a psychologist, they look for two core features. So this is based on the DSM five. And the two core features are pervasive social interaction challenges and the presence of restricted repetitive behavior. But there are a lot of people with autism who have anxiety. There are a lot of people with sensory challenges. There are a lot of people with seizure disorders, sleep disorders. So again, it's each person with autism has this sort of unique collection of traits and, you know, that's how they get diagnosed."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, so usually you need to have the diagnosis of autism, and then there are behavioral interventions or a variety of different ones that are used. There are some studies where, because autism is highly heritable, you can have one child with autism, and then if you have subsequent children, you're at an increased risk of having subsequent children with autism. And these are called baby sibling studies. So what you're doing is enriching the population of infants that you follow prospectively who are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis. And there are studies where some of those children are enrolled in behavioral studies even when they're quote unquote at risk."

Is that true? I mean, did that bear out in the data? If you look at profession or I or undergraduate major, does any of that correlate with the probability of having an autistic child?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. Well, what I can say is that there's been some studies. So what we know is that autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general population. And there was a study and there's a couple different instruments that are used to be able to measure these autistic traits. So there's something called the social responsiveness scale. And then that's a us based instrument. And there's an autism quotient that's a similar measure that was designed in England. And what we know from work with the AQ is that individuals that are in intense STEM fields, like engineering, physics, and math, have a greater burden of autistic traits, even if they don't have an autism diagnosis."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, so that leads me to wonder whether or not this whole business of a spectrum is actually multiple spectrims. Is it spectrums or spectri? Someone will put it in the comments on YouTube. We know that for sure. Please let me know. I would like to know what is the plural of spectrum spectrums? Because when we hear the word spectrum, we think, okay, there's a spectrum of severity. In fact, I have some experience with severe autism, not in my family, but where I went to undergraduate university, UC Santa Barbara. Down the way from that school was the Devereaux school, which was a school which has been there for a long time, that parents would send their kids if they were, quote unquote, severely autistic. It was actually where Dustin Hoffman went to study for his role in Rain man. And the kids, who were really delightful, they used to come into town every once in a while to the coffee shop where I'd study, and they would also continue on from there to Kmart, which is why the Dustin Hoffman character would say, gotta go to Kmart. Gotta go to. He would do that repetition, right, that Kmart was down the road from our, you know, our college housing and the Devereux school. Those kids were literally in a away from home facility full time. And I spoke to some of the parents at one point, and they were at that facility, meaning the parents had sent their children away to live there full time. Of course they'd get visits, and they'd get visits home because they were, I suppose we could say, at the far end of some spectrum that made it, at least to the parents idea, impossible for them to be at home. Okay. Now, at the other end of the spectrum, if one is just simply thinking in terms of severity, I know people who have self identified as autistic. That's how they've referred to it. So I feel comfortable saying that. They've said, I am autistic, and they seem pretty high functioning, meaning they have driver's licenses, drive cars, are healthy relationships, and manage life, apparently. Well, they have some traits that, yes, I would agree, are a little bit different. Right. So this is where we get into neurodivergence. But I guess the point is, should we think about autism as on a spectrum? Or given the fact that there are these kind of collections of different traits, could there be a spectrum of severity, also a spectrum of more stereotype behaviors, another spectrum that intersects with that, that has to do with obsession with a particular topic. You could imagine that there are 50 or 60 different spectri or spectrums. I still don't know which one to say. And that when we talk about the spectrum, we're really talking about something that's in multiple dimensions and not just one line that goes from severe to mild. Does that make sense?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think this is where understanding the biological basis of behavior would then allow us to be able to say, here's these different dimensions, but not understanding the biology you're left with. Okay, are we lumpers or splitters? How do we think about this? Because autism is highly heritable. So there's about 40% to 80% of autism is genetic. Right? So these vary wildly. Right. But the common thinking is that the majority, about 50% of autism is associated with common genetic variants. And so the way that we've always thought about this is that there is this. Autism is largely an inherited polygenic condition. But what I mean by that is that you have a lot of common variants that are additive. And so if you think about this collection of common genetic variants that underlie the spectrum, so if you have less of a dosing of some of these common variants, you might see somebody who's a lot more, who's higher functioning, like you said. And if you end up with one of these single gene, highly penetrant disorders, you might see severe intellectual disability and sort of lower functioning on the other end of the spectrum. But I think that there is a lot that we don't know. And what you're bringing up, I think, underlines sort of an issue with autism, which is common for many brain disorders, which is like, if you don't understand the underlying biological basis, it also gets very difficult to diagnose and treat. Right. And that's where we are with a lot of different psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders to date."

        "text": "Has there been any specific neural network that we can point to and say, ah, that's the neural network that seems to be different in people who are on the autism spectrum? I saw a study published recently that seemed to point to the idea that the genes that are altered in autism at least include a large number of genes that are altered or the proteins that are the consequence of those genes are altered and exist at the synapse, at the connections between neurons. And I'm asking it that way because some years ago, I was at a talk on autism at Stanford, and someone raised their hand and says, do we even know that autism is a brain issue? Couldn't it be an issue of the immune system or the cardiovascular system, which at the time seemed like, okay, gosh, of course. But wait, then you stop and you think, that's a really good question. How do we know? It's a challenge of the brain, right."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think that's a great question. Right. And there may be people talk about autism, right? And so when you think about where the major player is, you know, we're at the infancy of thinking about this, right? And so maybe for some people it's more of a brain based disorder. Maybe for some people it's, you know, the connection with the gut and the brain. Right. I think what's also really tricky, right. So one thing that you have to ask is, what are the barriers to progress in understanding autism? The way I think about this is that let's just take for a moment that this is a brain disorder. How do you study it in people? It's very difficult to get access to either cerebrospinal fluid, which is a fluid that bathes the brain, brain tissue biopsies. It's very hard to get people, especially children, that are really impacted into a brain scanner because they can't sit still. They may have sensory issues, go into a scanner. So a lot of the tools that neuroscientists or psychiatrists have to think about looking at the brain are limited. Right. And then the other part is, how do you model? So the other way we might think about getting access or thinking about model systems, what we need to do is think about the control animals, and we need to make sure that the species that we're modeling them in has features of control humans, if you will. So we need to have complex cognitive abilities. We need to have complex social skills. We need to have an organism that has vision as its primary sensory modality, potentially sleep consolidating. So we need to think about all of those. And the tricky part, I think, until fairly recently, was that we were doing all of this work in mouse models, and the control mice just fundamentally lack many of the characteristics that are needed to mice model autism with fidelity. Right. And I think that's when we look at drug development pipelines, about 50% of preclinical failures. So that would be something that's tested in an animal that works and then fails in a human clinical drug trial, 50% of those failures can be attributed to poorly selected animal models. And so I think part of where we will be getting traction is picking developing sophisticated models as a sort of point of entry into being able to understand some of these things that are really difficult to study in people."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, it's such a key point. And for those that have not heard of preclinical models, preclinical models are non human models. So it could be mouse, could be non human primate, could be flies or worms, for that matter. But we're going to talk a lot about non human primate preclinical models and the work that you've been doing, and of course, also the work that you've been doing in humans. The other animal."

        "text": "The other primate, right, exactly. Remind people that we're primates, old world primates. So thank you for doing that. So you've been talking about the genetic influences on autism, and of course, genes in the environment interact, right? It's never nature or nurture, it's always an interaction. And that isn't just about the epigenome. It's also just about the fact that nature impacts the genome, and our genome impacts the way that we interact with the environment, et cetera. So what is the role of the environment in autism? Both the frequency and the presentation of autism."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So, I mean, there are, again, in lots of different epidemiological studies, so advanced parental age, prematurity, severe prematurity is a risk factor for autism, maternal illness during pregnancy. So there's a bunch of different things that have been associated with an increased."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Risk for autism in terms of environmental influences and how they can intersect with biology. One of the things that I was really struck by in the early two thousands that, at least by my read of the literature, hasn't really gone anywhere, was this idea that was proposed by Pashko Rakesh, who used to run the neurobiology department at Yale, expert in brain neuroanatomy and non human primates, and in humans embryology, really a luminary of our field. And he had a series of papers exploring how the migration of neurons during early development. You and I both know, but most people out there probably don't know because we haven't covered this in the podcast. It's not typical dinner table conversation. When a human embryo is developing, the neurons are born at one location and they migrate out some distance to their final resting place, where then they grow out their connections and connect with one another. That process of neuronal migration is oh so critical for the eventual wiring of the brain. And Rakesh had this idea that perhaps, and I really want to emphasize perhaps, that the more frequent incidence of autism might be correlated with the increase in early prenatal ultrasound. And he had these papers published in a number of really high profile journals, including proceedings of National Academy and Science and elsewhere, showing that in a mouse model, if you do ultrasound, with each successive ultrasound, you got more migration errors. So to me, Washington, an interesting example of the environment frequency of ultrasound and cell migration having some sort of interaction, but it seemed like it never went anywhere. It never got tacked to, okay, you should keep in mind the number of ultrasounds that you're getting for your child. And of course, ultrasounds are critical for pregnant women to get because they can stave off a number of developmental issues and they're super important. But we've heard about ultrasound within the scientific literature, and then occasionally we'll hear other theories about, okay, it's having two parents who are both engineers, and then we'll hear, oh, you know, it's toxicity in the food environment. We've heard hypotheses about vaccines or the adjuvants that the vaccines are contained. And in that large cloud of theories, has anything really emerged from them? It's like, okay, there really seems to be at least one major risk factor, environmental risk factor, because I feel like all those theories come up, get some popular press, a bunch of papers are published, sometimes those papers are retracted, like in the case of the vaccines, and then the theory kind of dies. So is there any specific environmental influence on autism that we can say? Yes, there really seems to be something there."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. I mean, it's a really spectacularly good question. I think the tricky part about it is that every single person that comes into a trial has a different genetic background. Right. And so until we can have these a priori stratified trials where you could, then, you know, as a good scientist, you would only manipulate maybe one, two variables at a time. Right. But when you're doing these large epidemiological studies, because you can't, it's very difficult to do experimental studies. Right. Especially with developing children. I think that's an incredibly difficult study to do. Right. So there's been a. An interest in this field of, there's these neurogenetic syndromes that have high penetrance for autism, which basically means that you could have a disorder or another genetic condition. Let's say it doesn't have to be a single gene, but that a lot of those kids tend to also get an autism diagnosis. And so there's been work in like. So, for instance, fragile x is a good example where, because autism is so diverse in terms of clinical presentation that, let's say you have a medication that could work for a handful of kids in the trial, you may not be statistically powered to see it. Right. So the way I think about the autism world is there's so little we don't know. So think about being in a dark room, and you have a flashlight, and you only see where you shine the light. Right. And so if you think about a very heterogeneous, genetically heterogeneous study, it's going to be very difficult to tease out these pieces because an environmental risk factor might be a driver for one kid, but not another. Right. And so I think what we need to do is to have these genetically defined subgroups of individuals and then be able to test the gene by environment interactions, or in this genetically defined group of individuals, can we test this certain medication to see if it's beneficial for this subgroup of children?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Got it. So you mentioned fragile x, which we know presents with autism like symptoms in some cases. And then I think of another disease like Timothy syndrome, a mutation in an l type calcium channel, which, for those of you that don't know what these l type calcium channels are, they're not just important for the function of neurons in the brain, they're really important for the function of neurons and other tissues, including heart tissue. Kids with Timothy syndrome have cardiac issues, and they have autism. So I think it's important for us to kind of explore this a bit, because in most people's minds, kids with autism have autism, and occasionally they'll have other issues, gut issues or heart issues or musculoskeletal issues. But we often think that that's the consequence of the autism. But oftentimes they have multiple things going on, and the autism actually could be secondary or independent of. Of the other thing that's going on. So this is what leads me back to this idea of a spectrum. Is it possible that what we call autism is actually 50 different disorders or 50 different conditions, depending on what one wants to call them? I mean, what is autism really? I mean, what does it really center around? And I think here, maybe it's useful. Do we go to the diagnostic criteria? Like, how do we decide if a child has autism, if they also have a bunch of other things that are challenging them?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, I think that that's the $64,000 question. Right. And again, in other areas of medicine. So if you think about, let's think about cancer biology, right? Like decades ago, somebody would come in with cancer and you would hit them with radiation, chemotherapy, and that was the best that we could do, right? But with the invention of a lot of molecular tools, you can remove a tumor and you can do molecular profiling and even have personalized medications made right to attack that tumor. And so what's really tricky, when you have a behavioral diagnosis that's not biologically defined, you see a lot of heterogeneity. So it's incredibly difficult, I think, to answer this question because we don't know how many kinds of autism there are, right? Like there will be people who say if you have a disorder like fragile X or Potter Willie syndrome or Timothy syndrome or a variety of these other conditions, there will be people, I've heard clinicians say, well, that's not really autism, right? That's a piece of fragile x, right? But if it's a behavioral diagnosis and they meet behavioral criteria, it becomes this weird circular argument, right? So, like, until we really understand what autism is, I think that it's going to be very tricky to start, you know, sub defining different aspects of the condition."

Athletic greens, now called ag one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutrition needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera.

And we can't have that discussion without first having a discussion about two neuropeptides that I think most people have heard of at least one of them. And I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about. But you're going to clarify that for us which are oxytocin and vasopressin.

So if you think about a hormone or a neurotransmitter. So oxytocin, vasopressin them like a key and a receptor like a lock and you have to put them together to open a door open behavior. They can bind to these four receptors. So it can be very difficult to disentangle which one is acting and at which receptor and where in the brain."

        "text": "Yeah. Okay. So what's really fascinating is these two neurotransmitters, or hormones, were discovered for their peripheral effects, which basically means not in their brain, but somewhere in their body. And so oxytocin's involved in uterine contractions and milk let down, and so was during lactation. So people sort of always thought of it as the female hormone, and then vasopressin, at least in the peripheral system, has been involved in urine regulate, like urinary output regulation, blood pressure. And so we only knew about their physiological roles as their sort of classic hormones for decades. And what was interesting is these, like, naming conventions are fascinating in medicine. Right? So you could name a virus after where it was first found. Right. Or it could be named after somebody who discovered disease, like Alzheimer's, for instance, is a good example. And what was interesting, oxytocin was only named once. Vasopressin was named twice. So it's either called arginine vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone. And so it had two different names. And so, as you can imagine, sometimes genes are named twice. And so somebody in cancer is studying one gene and somebody in autism is studying another, and they're not even communicating because they don't even realize that they've, at least historically, now we have all kinds of gene annotation sites, so it's less likely to happen now. But what was fascinating is these hormones were named. Oxytocin is greek for quick birth. So for decades, people only appreciated their physiological roles. But there were neuroanatomists saying, hey, so these are both made. They're made in a lot of different places, but the action sort of happens in the hypothalamus where they're made. And there were anatomists that said, wait, these sort of project back into the brain. What are these doing in the brain? And one of my favorite historical stories was I had a mentor, a colleague, who I didn't train with, but he was a real source of wisdom to me for many years. And his name's court Peterson. And he told me this wonderful story about this Duke zoologist named Peter Klopfer. And Peter was studying ungulates. So sheep and goats. And he wrote a story, a paper in 1971 called Mother Love, what turns it on. And, you know, one thing about science is I love going back and seeing where do the pearls of wisdom come from? And so he wrote this and said, you know, oxytocin is orchestrating all these events of motherhood. And there are sheep and goats in particular that have offspring that are precocious, meaning they're basically born ready within an hour. They can run with the herd, unlike our species, which is altricial, meaning we have very helpless infants. And mom needs to bond really quickly with that baby if it's going to be running around. And you only from an evolutionary perspective, you want to be investing in the baby that's yours, not somebody else's. Right? And he hypothesized that it was oxytocin that was being co released into the brain. And during milk letdown, that was what turned mother love on. And that was really the beginning of this whole field of thinking. And so that opened up thinking about oxytocin in rodent maternal care and a variety of other instances."

Yes, and thank you for making it clear that oxydocin has many different roles. But this role of mother love and bonding to infant has me needing to ask whether or not the idea was that oxytocin is released in the mother when she interacts with her own baby. And that leads me to the question, is oxytocin also released in the baby in reaction to the mother? And how long is that effect lasting? Because in order to have a pervasive bond with that baby and not just some other baby, and of course, we still have visual cues and we know our baby versus another baby in most instances, there are rare exceptions, or perhaps not so rare exceptions. But leaving those aside, the mechanism that would allow for mother infant bonding, an infant mother bonding by way of oxytocin, presumably is something that is literally changing their brains, saying, you are the center of my life. And the baby, of course, is saying, well, you are my life because you are the source of life, certainly for the early part of life. And nowadays it seems that can extend well into the teens and twenties for some people. But how is oxytocin working? Is it working over the course of minutes, hours? Is there some specificity of this baby and this mom that links them in some more pervasive way? I mean, how is oxytocin doing this magic of bonding."

So if you think about sheep or goats, the early studies that were done, are you. The passage through the vaginal canal was what, you know, so you activated oxytocin receptors that way. But if you gave an oxytocin antagonist, meaning you would give into the brain something that blocked the oxytocin receptor. So if the oxytocin is being released into the brain, but you have a pharmacological agent blocking its ability to bind to its receptors, these sheep and goats wouldn't bond to their baby, for instance."

And so we, and we do all kinds of care of extended relatives. And so you wouldn't necessarily expect in a primate species where you have this long rearing history where help from the family and biparental care, where sort of everybody sort of, of like, it takes a village to raise the baby, we readily adopt in our, in primate societies. Right. And so, you know, like, I had a c section. I mean, I'll tell you something personal. I had a c section and I had a lot of postpartum complications. And so lactation didn't work out that well for me. One of my friends would say I had massive dvts and pulmonary emboli. And so I almost died after my son was born the first time.

You know, what I will say is it's really different in primates, and we don't really understand how bonding occurs. But what I will say is that bonding between a mother, you really need to think about the evolutionary selective pressures. So I was an evolutionary biologist before I found neuroscience, right? And so I really, everything I do, I think about from an evolutionary perspective. But it is. Many people go into the oxytocin vasopressin field because they have a lot of questions about social interactions, right? Like, I think if you think about it, is being social is actually one of the core characteristics of our species, right? So social interactions are rewarding from infancy. They keep us alive, as you mentioned. Right. And so I think it's not an accident that the way we think about disorder in our species is many disorders are disorders because of lack of social connectedness. Right? So it could be something like autism, wherever, where there's these pervasive social interaction impairments. It could be something like drug abuse, where a risk factor for drug abuse is feeling socially disconnected and alone. Right. Social isolation or loss of a loved one is a very strong predictor of the onset of a stress related depressive."

It was unfortunately nicknamed the love hormone. And the reason it's unfortunate it was, is that while that might cue attention to oxytocin, and I'm a big fan of people paying attention to biological phenomena, it discards the other and many roles of oxytocin. But what can we say about oxytocin in humans, if anything, do we know that it does? So we're assuming based on the animal models that it does something. I mean, this is very different than dopamine, where there's tons of animal model data, but we know. But there brain imaging, where we know where dopamine is expressed. And do we even know where oxytocin receptors are expressed in the human brain? Presumably that information is out there recently."

And you need, you know, a lot of this work has been done. So you have to think about how do we study it? Right. So the best way to study it would be to have radio tracers where you could then, which we do have for dopamine and other compounds where you would then go and see where after somebody's performed a task, do we see activation or uptake? There are some imaging studies that are usually done giving intranasal oxytocin. And then you basically ask questions about, okay, we give you oxytocin intranasally, which presumably enters the brain. We could talk about reasons why we think that. And then we have you perform on some task. Right. And so there's evidence if you give oxytocin, it diminishes the amygdala response to fearful stimuli. Right. So that it might have this sort of pro social effect. And it was actually data like that that caused people to start thinking initially about oxytocin."

And we just always have to be careful to not have it lead to the assumption that that's the only role of a given hormone. So it can reduce, apparently it can reduce the output of the amygdala in some way, this brain area associated with threat detection. And so you could imagine how that would bias the person toward being more prosocial. Have there been studies exploring the role of oxytocin in making autistic children more pro social? And behind that question, I suppose, is the assumption you can verify or not that autistic children are less prosocial than other children. Is that true? Or is it that autistic kids are just maybe more pro social with the one friend they really, really like? I happen to know some kids with autism, or however you want to phrase it, and they have close friends, and they seem to really like those specific friends a lot. Like, they seem very happy when they show up at the door and like, all the hallmarks of healthy social mind. But it is true that they are uncomfortable in groups and where there's a lot of noise, a busy birthday party is overwhelming for them. But you see them playing with one or two friends, and, like, you could see all that and assume, okay, it's just kind of an introverted kid. Actually, it kind of reminds me of me. I mean, I don't have a problem with crowds, but I much prefer to be with a small group of friends or one close friend."

And so there could be people that are socially avoidant and really just don't want to have social interactions. There could be kids that are active but odd, which means that they have an interest in being social, but maybe they don't read social cues. Right.

I mean, people having a disinterest in social interactions could be that they're highly socially anxious. Right. That making eye contact makes them anxious. You could have somebody who maybe is relatively, let's say, socially intact, if you will, but they have overwhelming sensory abnormalities that make it very difficult to interact with other people. Right. So let's just say again, that's another caveat. There have been some studies administering oxytocin to individuals with autism. And again, these are these single dose studies. So the first studies that were done were looking at single dose oxytocin in males, because some of the. And we can talk a little bit about why oxytocin versus vasopressin which vasopressin actually would have been my choice based on the animal literature, and we can talk about that. But vasoxytocin was given to males partly because it wouldn't. The idea would be that the off target effects in the peripheral nervous system, that is, milk let down uterine contractions, are not gonna happen in males. Right.

But, of course, there could be other peripheral effects of oxytocin in males, but they had to pick one, so they went with males. Okay.

And so then there's been a lot of studies looking at, you know, there's one reading the mind and the eyes. So can you look at pictures of somebody's eyes and then ask, what is the emotion that they're feeling right after receiving this? Where is your eye gaze going in a picture? Right. So one of the theories is that people with autism may, at least a subset of them, lack social motivation. So maybe they're not looking in the places like eyes, where you receive a lot of social cues that are relevant to social communication. And so some of these early studies showed that a single dose of oxytocin in people that had high functioning autism, so they were verbal, like you said, they could come in for studies, and that it looked like it had some potential effectiveness.

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it's such a great question. Okay, so we should unpack that because there's been a lot of work in this area. So the first question is, where are we measuring the oxytocin? Right. So we mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of effects in the body as well as the brain, and it's released into the blood, but it's also released directly into the brain. And there's variable evidence about, if you measure it in blood, is it a readout of the brain or not? Right. Or should you be looking at something like spinal fluid that's maybe a better biochemical proxy of the brain? Most studies. So what I will say is there were, there's been a handful of small studies where there has been some, you know, there's been some benefits, maybe no benefit, small effects. We did a study that was a small study at Stanford, and it was based on mouse genetic data. And I'll sort of walk you through what we did. So there's multiple mouse models of these neurogenetic syndromes where people have social impairment. Right. We can quibble about whether that's autism or not, but that they have social impairment. And so that there are this fragile x mouse. There's a potter Willie syndrome mouse, which is the magile two gene that gets manipulated, and then there's a catnap two mouse. And in all of those instances, when you genetically modify those mice, you see a reduction of oxytocin in the hypothalamus. And what's interesting is that in those instances where you see this genetic modification, you do see lower blood levels in these genetically defined models. What's really cool is you can give oxytocin across development in those models, and at least in the catnap two mouse, you can restore oxytocin, neuron number two equivalent of control animals, suggesting that oxytocin is doing something in these oxytocin deficient animals. These are not an oxytocin gene manipulation, but these are these syndromes where you see, as a consequence of manipulating genes for these syndromes, that oxytocin gets knocked down. Right. And so our thinking when we went into our clinical trial was, what if its blood oxytocin levels, that there were going to be a subset of individuals that just make less oxytocin?"

These are done with my colleague Antonia Hardin at Stanford, who's a child psychiatrist. And we always have double blind, meaning that the investigative team is blind and that they are unaware, I should say they're unaware of treatment, and then the families and the children are unaware, and then they're randomized, meaning there was an equal chance you could get either drug or placebo. And they're controlled. Right. Okay. So we asked if we know what your pre treatment blood oxytocin level, who's gonna benefit from treatment? And we found a couple really interesting things. One was that the lower your baseline, so your pre treatment blood oxytocin level, you showed much greater benefit from the oxytocin intervention. These are children."

And so what we had thought was that, well, maybe if everybody had measured baseline blood oxytocin levels, maybe some of these, you know, maybe there would have been more positive outcomes. So. But there's a lot of controversy in this field about whether oxytocin is a treatment for autism. Right. So after we completed that trial, there was a large multisite, what's called a phase three oxytocin treatment trial that was done at, I think, five sites, and they gave oxytocin for an extended period of time, and they showed no benefit."

And so if you don't adhere to those rigid protocols, which is very difficult to do across multiple sites, it can be very difficult to get an accurate read of oxytocin. And so I think, for me, it's still an open question. They didn't see that blood oxytocin predicted response in that study. The data weren't provided in the paper. It was just said that they didn't. But it's still an open question to me. Like, what if there was a group of children who had low oxytocin levels and they could benefit, right? There's other people where they'll say, no, no, no, we don't think that chronic oxytocin is a good idea, that what you really should be doing is just giving it before a behavioral therapy session. Right? And so that maybe that is the way. So if you give it acutely, like in those early studies we talked about, that maybe oxytocin diminishes fear. We know that oxytocin decreases the stress axis, the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal axis, and then it can diminish anxiety in animal models. So that's well established. And in a former life, I was a stress researcher, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. But it's sort of. The sad thing is that once you have a negative trial, there isn't a lot of interest in funding the work going forward. Right. And so I think it's still really an open question about. There is a subset of individuals that could benefit from oxytocin replacement therapy. Right. And it's. And until there's money to do that work, we may not ever know the answer."

        "text": "Well, it will be important for that work to be done eventually. Hopefully, the field will return to it, despite whatever trends might be happening. Now, I think it's important to know, for the parents of autistic children, whether or not there were any negative effects, effects of oxytocin administration, in particular in the children that did not benefit from oxytocin treatment. The rationale is the following. Well, of course, these things require a prescription if a parent has a child with autism, especially if they're young enough that the behavioral interventions could possibly stand a good chance of inducing neuroplasticity, rewiring of the neural circuits that underlie social connection. Well, then there's this time limited window in which those parents presumably are willing to try most anything, provided it's safe. So let's assume, and I'm making up these numbers now because I haven't seen this study, but according to what you told me, that, let's say a third of the autistic boys and girls that come in have low baseline levels of oxytocin. They're the ones that are going to benefit from this oxytocin intervention. The other but two thirds don't. Well, given the difficulties of measuring baseline levels of oxytocin, most people don't have access to those kind of resources. Um, if it's safe to give oxytocin no matter what, well, then if I were that parent, I'd be knocking on my physician's door saying, hey, give me an oxytocin spray, because my kid might fall into that one third category if and only if it turns out that oxytocin is safe to give. But if there's a risk profile that doesn't justify that kind of shotgun approach, well, then I wouldn't do that. So is oxytocin spray safe? And if so, why doesn't every physician who has a patient with autism give them oxytocin nasal spray?"

And so I think the tricky part is that one thing I will say is that all of the studies, and there's been many of them, have shown that oxytocin is relatively safe in a pediatric population. Right. The tricky part is, I don't know, there's physicians that really pay attention to clinical trials, and if they don't see a benefit, they may not be willing to write the prescription. Right. So until we could identify a group of children that could benefit, you know, we need to create the opportunity for physicians to recognize that this could potentially still be a treatment. Right. Work. You know, but I think the tricky part, and what I will say is, and we can maybe talk a bit about vasopressin, which, you know, my feeling is that if I was placing bets and having to choose between these two, my money would be on vasopressin."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, we are definitely going to talk about vasopressin in detail. I mean, the reason I mentioned that hypothetical scenario is just the sense of urgency and in some cases, desperation that parents feel, and time's ticking. And if oxytocin's safe, then I guess I'll put in my vote that parents should at least talk to their physician, maybe even hand them the study to consider. But I can also understand the perspective of a pediatrician who says, well, listen, it was a small number of kids that benefited. You're welcome to try it, but it doesn't seem like the results are that impressive. But this gets to a bunch of larger issues about medical care and randomized controlled trials and the desperation of parents and kids to treat neurodevelopmental challenges. I just want to ask because it feels relevant in a real way, if ultimately the goal of improving symptom profiles in autistic kids is about improving social cognition and social behavior, and that process involves rewiring of brain circuits. Neuroplasticity. Is there any reason to think that other approaches to inducing neuroplasticity would be beneficial, even if they're not in the biological pathways that are disrupted in autism? I think, for instance, about the now extensive use of SSRI's for the treatment of depression. Some cases it works, in some cases it doesn't. Side effect profiles are a serious concern, as discussed on this podcast before. But ultimately, we know that depression is not a serotonin deficiency. In most cases, SSRI's or atypical antidepressants like proprierone, wellbutrin, and things of that sort. When they work, they probably work because of their ability to induce or assist neuroplasticity. Also, the trials on psilocybin are not really about psilocybin. They're about neuroplasticity, at least the trials for depression. There may be other uses of psilocybin that relate more directly to the effects of psilocybin. Ultimately, what we're talking about here is the attempt to rewire the brain in a specific way, whether or not it's assisted by oxytocin or some other mechanism. So the question is, are there trials happening where people are exploring, say, psilocybin MDMA, which, by the way, we know increases oxytocin, I was going to say, and serotonin dramatically, as well as things like atypical antidepressants, antidepressants in kids that have autism, not because we think that those autistic kids are deficient in any of the neurochemicals that these drugs would target, but that these drugs can help rewire the brain. And ultimately that's what these kids need."

There might be kids where there would be a medication that would target other pathways, but that potently releases oxytocin. Right. But there might be kids that have an oxytocin deficiency. Right. That. That circles back to your point at the beginning, or our point is that autism is a very heterogeneous condition. And being able to know before you begin a trial. Right. Like, who am I gonna put into it and what is my primary outcome? Like one measure that I think is gonna move the needle. Right. Like it kind of requires a crystal ball. So there's a lot of guesswork that goes into this, but I would very much like to see, I will say one other thing that I have a colleague named Adam Gustala who's at the University of Sydney, and he published a paper a year or two ago now suggesting that oxytocin may be most effective in kids at younger ages. And don't quote me, somewhere between two and, you know, two and five or three insects or something, we'll find the."

And maybe age is a driver or maybe low blood oxytocin, regardless of what age you are. Or maybe in Adam's case, if you recruit really young children, you're likely to see a benefit just because the brain is wiring up and it's more plastic at younger ages."

And so you could have a clinic where you're showing troublesome features and a parent wants to get their kid into a clinic. And you could have a twelve month or 18 month wait time. Right. And so there are a lot of people that are thinking about, are there laboratory based tests that we can develop, maybe either for detection or clinical referral. Right. So could we come up with a biomarker panel, for instance, where we might be able to say, wow, here's a panel where we think this child is at reasonable risk for developing autism. Can we make sure they're prioritized for getting a diagnosis right so we can get them an early intervention, but right now, we don't have that. Right. So having some sort of laboratory based test, whether it could be biological or if we could do something with eye gaze, and there's a lot of companies working on these things now to say, this may not work. And also, obviously, again, autism is always controversial in this field. There's so many different stakeholders. A lot of clinicians will say, well, I don't want a 32nd video clip replacing expert clinical opinion. There's good reasons for them to feel that way. But I think if there was a way to prioritize people that are in this line, you know, we could get diagnoses faster."

Like, it seems to me that, well, I recall in school they gave us the hearing test. We all marched on the bus. We get the beep test, you know, for hearing challenges. We get vision tests. You get the Babinski reflex test, not the moment you come out of the womb, but pretty soon after. I mean, why isn't this stuff happening for autism for every kid?"

It could be a behavioral pediatrician. It could be a child psychiatrist or child neurologist. But again, that requires years and years of training. And if we look in areas where people have fewer access to resource, I mean, particularly in impoverished areas, the mean age of an autism diagnosis is years later than in wealthy areas where there's many different medical specialists with parents that aren't working three jobs and can sit waiting around and really lobby and really advocate for their kids, because if they don't show up for work that day, they're not going to get fired from their job. Right. And so I think that if there's some sort of solution that allows there to be a more democratic approach to saying we need a really quick way, like you said, to be able to identify at risk children, especially if it's a blood test or something like that, it could be incredibly impactful."

That seems to be the major source of the MDMA effect, so to speak. Based on the work of our colleague Rob Malenka and at least one human study comparing MDMA to very high dose oxytocin treatment ruled out the oxytocin spike that's induced by MDMA as the source or the only source. But of course, these chemicals can synergize, but based on its chemical profile, oxytocin release, massive serotonin release, dopamine release, and a propensity to enhance neuroplasticity. Assuming all the safety protocols calls were there. Seems like not the perfect drug, but not a bad choice if, of course, it's inducing the kind of plasticity that someone with autism would be seeking."

But things like Adderall, vivance, even methylphenidate, Ritalin, I mean, these are amphetamines. They induce dopamine release and norepinephrine release. And again, I'm not suggesting people give their kids MDMA to try and ameliorate symptoms of autism, but something chemically similar to it ought to be developed or at least explored in a human trial, in my opinion. Well, time will tell. I'll reach out to the maps group and see what's happening. Let's talk about vasopressin, because there's a lot to discuss there.

And what's really interesting about vasopressin, I always sort of joke that oxytocin always saw its day in the sun, if you will. And the vasopressin was sort of this stepchild that was left behind. And the reason why I find this fascinating is, again, I think back to my roots as an evolutionary biologist, behavioral neuroscientist. And what was interesting is that there were studies in the early to mid 1990s showing that vasopressin was critical for male social behavior. And so there was work. There was a variety of people. And I think Rob Malenko mentioned this on the podcast he did about. There was a group of people like Sue Carter, Larry Young, Tom insull, some of these early people, and they gave vasopressin to male prairie voles.

So the males and females have lots of different partners, raise young with lots of different partners, mating with lots of different partners. And that if you give vasopressin, then you can make the. I always want to call them polyamorous, but I don't know if they love each other. I'm going to anthropomorphize and assume they love each other. The polygamous moles.

Dad participates in paternal care with mom, they co raise babies together, and then dad chases off intruders. Right. And then there's the more asocial voles. And so these are like the Montaigne volese. And it's a complicated story, but there's these Montaigne voles where males and females live separately. Females maybe live on the males territory. The male mates with a few different females. Absolutely. Doesn't provide any paternal care at all. Mom raises babies by herself. Right. So these are really the two."

And all you have to do is give them a single injection of vasopressin and you know, or you can give an antagonist. And usually the way they form the bond is through mating, right? So they, you put them with a female, they mate, they cohabit for a bit. There's been all kinds of parametric studies. I can't remember how many hours it takes to form a pair bond, but then you can and do these things called partner preference tests, and then you can say, here's the guy that you mated with, here's this guy you don't know, and you can do it for males and you can do it for females. And they pick their partner, they choose to go hang out with their partner. The montane voles either after mating with somebody, may either be equal or maybe they'll even go spend time with the new individual. So the cleanest story was that prairie voles are monogamous. Montane voles are not monogamous, but in the prairie voles you could give vasopressin instead of mated cohabitation and you could turn on like, you know, a bond with somebody after only living with them for a very short period of time, right? Or you could induce paternal behavior. And I was working with a vole species in grad school, I think the most interesting scientific experience that I've ever had, right?

And she said, well, I don't have prairie voles. I have these meadow voles, and I'm studying because they're so sensitive to light, and they change their behavior based on light. And she said, well, you can do what you want, but our grants basically have to have a circadian component. And so she said, you got to work that in. But then we kind of struck this deal. So I was hanging out in the animal rooms, and I thought it was really fascinating. So she had animals that were either on short day lengths or long day lengths. So the mimicking summer and winter, and I was noticing that on winter day lengths, the males were hanging out with the females. And when the female had a litter, he was, like, participating.

And so what was interesting is at the end of the summer days, as you're going into winter, territories collapse and males are found with females and they co raise babies. It makes sense if it's you're going to have a litter and mom needs to get up to go eat, you need somebody to sit there and warm those babies, or they're going to die because they're going to freeze to death, right? So I started saying, like, wow, I think these medovoles are good dads. Like, I'm noticing this. And so I told my thesis advisor, I want to study how oxytocin and vasopressin can maybe this is involved in tracking these evolutionary mating strategies. And so, again, like, the coolest experience I ever had was on these males that were housed under short day lengths. So they were like, winter males. I was able to put vasopressin directly into their brainstor and it was like turning on a light switch. And they ran around the cage, picked up all these babies, put them in a nest and huddled over them. And if you put a placebo into their brain, nothing happened. And so to me, I always filed that away in the back of my mind of like, wow, vasopressin is this really interesting hormone. And maybe someday I will.

And my chair at the time said, while almost nothing is known about the biological basis of autism, why don't you go? I'm going to introduce you to the head of child psychiatry. You should go talk to this group. And so as I was preparing my slides and realizing that social interaction impairments were a core feature of autism, I thought, wow, these neuropeptides may really be a part of this puzzle. And so that's actually really. I got pulled into autism research was through that, and everybody at the time was very interested in oxytocin. And I remember thinking, so we actually did probably the most definitive blood oxytocin study, because there was this idea, again, this marketing campaign of the oxytocin deficit hypothesis of autism. And given how clinically heterogeneous autism was, we got money, actually, from the Simons foundation, and we did the first study with maybe 200 kids. And what we were able to show was that blood oxytocin was not a marker of autism, right? So it wasn't like there was a bimodal distribution, meaning two completely non overlapping levels of oxytocin in people with autism, people without autism. So the lower your blood oxytocin levels, actually, regardless of who you were, you could be a child with autism, you could be an sibling with autism, or you could be a unrelated control child. And it was the lower your blood oxytocin levels, the greater your sort of social difficulties. And the slopes, you know, were different. They started at different points because the behaviors were obviously different. But that's what got us thinking about our clinical trial, which is that blood oxytocin level is not going to be this great differentiator between people with and without autism. Right. But we might be able to find a subgroup who could benefit from treatment."

We don't want to say discards, but it sets aside this thing that we call autism, which is already hard to define and diagnose, and there's all these different spectrums, and you're trying to figure and just says, okay, children with autism have challenges in social cognition, social behavior, social bonding."

And so maybe you go after a particular symptomology and try and attack that, and you might actually potentially treat or cure multiple diseases. It's a very different approach, and I hope people are catching on to the subtlety, but also the. The potential impact of that, because if I heard correctly, you said there are people who are not autistic who have social functioning deficits, and they, too, have less circulating oxytocin."

But maybe it's cause the name isn't as there's something about oxytocin that kind of sounds like the love, looks like the love hormone, but like, vasopressin be renamed, right? Well, and it should be called something else, like, not antidiuretic hormone, not vasopressin. I mean, you're gonna tell us how critically important it is, perhaps even more important than oxytocin for autism and social functioning. So, I don't know.

And so I actually came at it from the work that we did in monkeys. And so I think I mentioned previously at the beginning of the podcast that there were a lot of limitations that I saw. And then sometimes if you come into a field when you're a little bit of an outsider, right, like, I'm not a clinician, I don't see autism patients. But I also, I have this really strong interest in social behavior and the biology of it. And so I was thinking about, what are things that we need to do to better address the challenges in autism? So, one of them was, why are we looking in blood? Right. Like, if you look at neurological conditions, there has been a lot of progress made by doing biomarker discovery in cerebral spinal fluid, right? So, like, the biological substrates or clues of markers of, say, various forms of dementia or Ms were first found in spinal fluid, right, because it's the fluid that bathes the brain in the spinal column. And so if you're looking for the biochemistry of an illnesse, that's the closest fluid that you can get to the brain. Right."

        "text": "Maybe. Right. So that was part of my thinking, but then there was the issue of the animal models, right? So there was drug after drug after drug that was tested in mice, and they failed in human clinical trials. And so it made me start thinking, could we develop a primate model of naturally occurring social impairments? Right? So can we? Because in autism, these social impairments are, if you will, naturally occurring. Right. And so these spontaneously occur in children. And so it made me wonder, could we identify monkeys in a large colony that have social impairments? And after talking to clinicians who treat these children, can I spend a lot of time validating a monkey model where there will be monkeys that have features that look like they have direct relevance to core autism symptoms? And so what I did was, there's a primate center, the California National Primate research center. And so what we did is, so I think I mentioned earlier that there's these surveys that can be used to look at autistic traits in the general human population, right? And so we refined one of these, and we did what we call back translate. So, basically, it's an instrument that's used for humans, and then what we did is modified it to be able. Able to use this rating scale in rhesus macaques, which are an old world monkey. And I know you're familiar with them, and I was interested in looking at old world monkeys because they're some of the closest relatives to human that are used in biomedical research. And as I mentioned previously, these autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general human population, and that this genetic, say, let's call it genetic liability, which is a fancy way of just saying that we think that there's a genetic risk that underlies this continuum of behavioral traits, right? So if we think that that's true in humans and in one of our closest relatives, and we think that some of these genes create proteins that then are what sets up the developing brain to develop in the way that autistic brains develop. So let's just assume that that's the premise. That's what we went in with. Can we find rhesus macaques that are just living in large outdoor colonies and identify animals that might have be good models for autism? And the answer is yes. We could do this all kinds of different ways. One is we could just take people and score monkey behaviors outside their cages while they're interacting with their peers. We can use rating scales. And again, the rating scale we use is called the social responsiveness scale. So this is called the macaque social responsiveness scale revised. It's a mouthful, but what it allows us to do is measure autistic like traits in monkeys. And we can also bring monkeys in for experimental tests to see where their eyes look or how do they perform? How do they respond to videos of other monkeys? You know, if they're making affiliative overtures, do they do like, you know, you know, macaques go, go, which is a positive response. Well, they do that. Right."

And by the way, what we're referring to here are non invasive observational studies, at least thus far. These are monkeys living in large exclosures, not enclosures. Large exclosures forming colonies and social relationships. And I think anyone that sees monkeys at the zoo, and we all learn that monkeys go and they don't. If you want a monkey to like you, you learn this working with macaques. First of all, they don't. The affiliative call is they do this really nice. And the little ones, you do that very well. I spent a lot of time with these monkeys. And the little ones, they do this thing where they go. I used to nurse the little ones every once in a while. They. And they're just, you know, it just, like, makes your heart melt. I think there must have been an oxytocin dump at that moment. That's probably happening right now.

There's all, you know, there's reasons you just have to, you know, you basically have to stand by what you're modeling. And so I think one of my. The biggest issues I have with this sort of mouse phenotyping mafia is that, you know, there's this group of tests that they use, and they use it in every single disorder, right? And then if there's a positive hit, it's like, oh, this is like, you know, this test is really for Parkinson's today, but it's for depression tomorrow. Right. And so my. My goal was to devise very specific tests that would allow us to evaluate core features of autism in this model. And the answer is, we found it. If you look at monkeys that spend a lot of time alone, they have a much greater burden of autistic like traits. Measuring on this rating scale, they have diminished social motivations. So other monkeys will come up and interact with them, but they don't engage in social overtures that much themselves. They do less grooming, less affiliative behaviors. In some of the work that we're doing, they don't lip smack back. And we can talk a little bit about that. We did a pharmacological probe, and we can talk a bit about what vasopressin does to that, which is kind of exciting. And so we spent a lot of time validating this behavioral phenotype, right. To say that we really feel like there are core aspects of it that are allowing us to model autism. And I have a paper which, if you want to put it in, it's all about creating this monkey model power of doing it and where it took us clinically."

And there's just a lot of differences between primate brains and rodent brainstor. And we have a very elaborate frontal cortex, a bunch of other circuitry that mice, if they have that, they probably use it for other things. And it's just very hard to draw conclusions from those models. And they're great for probing functions that are, let's just call them more autonomic type functions and for doing some of the initial investigations. But I think, while I don't want to see every research lab switch over to primates, I think one has to be really thoughtful about the kinds of experiments one does with primates at all.

So what we wanted to ask was, are there any molecules that allow us to differentiate these, what we'll call them, naturally low social or low social monkeys from socially competent high social monkeys. And so we measured a bunch of different readouts of neurotransmitter systems that were either involved in mammalian social behavior, had been implicated in idiopathic, meaning autism that doesn't have a genetic cause, or these neurogenetic syndromes that we've been talking about where there's pathways that are really associated with them?

They're going to draw cerebral spinal fluid. I mean, not that much more invasive and time consuming than getting a needle into your vein for a blood draw. Right. I mean, we think of it as it's technically a little bit more challenging, but there's, CSF draws in humans all the time.

And so he developed this, and we do all of our work together. I would say 95% of it. We just love working together. And he developed a statistical winnowing strategy to identify what were the key drivers. And what was fascinating is, in this first monkey cohort, it was the cerebral spinal fluid levels of vasopressin that were really what was driving this classification. Right. So if we just knew your levels of vasopressin in spinal fluid but not in blood, interestingly, we could pretty closely, perfect to perfect, classify you as high or low social. And so then we replicated that again in another monkey cohort, because obviously, as a scientist, you always want to replicate your work. And then if it was really a biomarker, meaning it's a molecule in the body, that gives us an indication of something, and in this case, it's an indication of your social functioning, we were able to look at monkeys, and we saw that the vasopressin was consistent across measurement times. So there was a wide variety of vasopressin levels, but within an individual monkey, it was pretty much the same. Right. So that's what you want to see with a biomarker. And then we showed that the vasopressin levels were closely linked to grooming time spent in grooming. And as we mentioned, I think we mentioned earlier, grooming is, in many monkey species, a critical behavior that solidifies social bonds and maintains them. And so the individuals with the lowest CSF vasopressin levels had spent the less time, the least amount of time in grooming."

And it all seems to have to do with proximity, like, how close are you going to let me get to you? Vice versa. In humans, we talk about personal space, and there's a whole set of things related to consent in this whole allopathic grooming thing. And then if a chimp misbehaves on an outing, then they aren't groomed by others and they can actually get parasitic infections and it can be very costly.

But of course, somebody will say, and I will say upfront, monkeys don't have autism. Then the question becomes, does this have what's called translational value? So can I see this observation in an animal model? And will it provide fundamental insights into humans? Right. And so I wanted to get cerebral spinal fluid from people to test this hypothesis, because we had, in parallel, done a study looking at blood vasopressin levels in people without autism, and we didn't see a group difference there, unlike this really profound difference that we saw when we looked at spinal fluid in the monkeys. And again, I think I mentioned the blood vasopressin levels were indistinguishable if you were high or low social monkeys. So there was something about looking more proximate to the brain that was giving us more information than, say, the blood alone. And so I said I wanted to get spinal fluid. And like you said, people do this all the time. How would we? But we're, you know, it's not gonna be a first pass, especially when we don't really have any evidence in people to go in for what we would call a research lumbar puncture. Right. And so I had to get really creative about, how do I get spinal fluid from children? And what we did was we piggybacked on to a clinical indication for a spinal fluid draw, and we did this. So I tried to get funding for this. Again, I think this is important for people to know how science is done. And so I wrote all these grant applications. Nobody would fund it. They said this is really interesting. It's too high risk. You won't be able to pull it off. And I don't usually back down from a challenge. If I think something's a good idea and I want to do it, I'm going to find a way to do it. If it's impossible, that's one thing. But if it's hard to do it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. You just have to figure out how to do it. And so I always try to see bridges where other people see barriers, right. And so it's like, well, how can I access spinal fluid? And so I went around talking to all my friends who were on, and Stanford's really wonderful because it's such a small school. Right.

So we could either get a little bit extra when it was being drawn for a research indication so they were getting a spinal tap no matter what. And then we were just, either we're getting a little bit extra or we were going to get the remnant that they were going to throw out. Right.

So we got the sort of healthiest people we could, given that everybody was coming in for a medical reason, to have a lumbar puncture. And in this first study, we had seven children with autism. Seven children without autism. And we could nearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14 individuals by just knowing their CSF vasopressin level alone, which is pretty remarkable given that there isn't a biological indicator that we. A robust biological indicator that we know."

        "text": "Correct. And again, and what I will say is, in our monkey studies and in our human studies, CSF oxytocin level became our control. Right. So in our monkeys, there were no difference in CSF oxytocin by group. And then in this first study, there were no differences in CSF oxytocin levels. A sample size of 14 is intriguing, but given autism so clinically heterogeneous, we want to replicate it. And so I knew that there was a professor at the NIH named Sue Sweeto who was collecting cerebral spinal fluid as part of a research study because she was interested in immune parameters and folate deficiency. So she had children that were medically healthy, and they were getting just like at NIH, you get these huge workups. So they were very well characterized participants. So we were able to look at. And again, we also. This is the first time we were able to look at girls. So we had a small sample of girls and we had boys, and we basically just asked the question, can we replicate this? And I was very interested in, well, oxytocin be what's different in the girls, right. So maybe there will be some sex specificity here and that we'll see low CSF vasopressin in. In the males and low CSF oxytocin in girls. That was not the case. What we found was that in the individuals with autism, regardless of their biological sex, that they all had lower CSF vasopressin levels than the individuals without autism. And because they were so well characterized, we were also able to show on a gold standard research diagnostic assessment of autism. So it's an assessment that's used in a research situation to validate an autism diagnosis by an expert clinical opinion that the lower your vasopressin levels in spinal fluid, the greater your social symptom severity, your clinical symptom severity. And then we asked, it's like, well, vasopressin's involved in social behavior, but it's not really that involved in restricted, repetitive behaviors. And that was actually the case. So it was the CSF vasopressin track the social symptoms of, not the repetitive symptom severity, suggesting that there might be other biological measures that could be included as a way to have a more powerful way to differentiate people with and without autism. And so then I was really. So that was really exciting to replicate that. And then I had a colleague named John Constantino, who is now at Emory, but he used to be at Washu. And I knew that John. I had been at a meeting in, I think it was 2010, and I found out that he had what I will call liquid gold. So he had this -80 sea freezer that had a bunch of neonatal infant CSF samples that he had from human infants, and he had collected them. And again, this was under ethical approvals. And it was basically these infants came in for something that needed to be worked up that was very rare. They would, you know, they could die, so they needed to get a medical treatment for it. But the vast majority of these children ended up being healthy. So it was a pretty healthy sample, if you will. Right. And so I knew he had all these samples, and I said to him, wouldn't it be really interesting if we teamed up and we look at this CSF vasopressin finding in children before the period when behavioral symptoms first manifest. Right."

But I think it's important because this was a question that I was thinking about earlier, and I imagine many other people were, too. You find these monkeys that have social interaction deficits. You find kids that have social interaction deficits, and you see that there's low vasopressin in both groups. This extends to male and female children. But then, of course, the question becomes, well, maybe they have low vasopressin because of so many years or even months of social interaction deficits. That's right. That the direction of causality isn't clear. And so when you said liquid gold, referring to the CSF from these infants, taken prior to any opportunity for social interaction beyond just whatever interaction they had with their mother up until the point the CSF draw was taken, this really gets at the issue of causality."

And then what we did is he looked to see who went on to develop autism and who didn't. Right? So then what we had was spinal fluid samples that have sort of been waiting in the freezer, if you will. And then we could ask, do individuals who later receive an autism diagnosis many months or even years later, already have low vasopressin levels as infants? And the reason why this was a compelling question to ask is there's evidence to suggest that behavioral therapies are more effective the younger the child is. Right? And if you think about it, if behavioral characteristics of autism emerge across development, what if, and this is sort of my, we haven't, we haven't substantiated this yet, but this is like sort of my big question, what if all these autism susceptibility genes some and interact and converge upon a few common pathways in the brain, right? And so for years people have talked about this excitatory inhibitory balance theory of autism, but what if vasopressin is one of those pathways because it's so critically involved in social functioning? And so what I was interested in. And so let's just say for a moment, you know, your genes are set at birth. What if the vasopressin is already low in the brains of these infants? And so it puts them on this very different trajectory where you have this cumulative effect of they're maybe a little bit less socially interested and maybe they're not making the eye contact. And if there was a way to intervene really early, even potentially with a vasopressin replacement therapy, that you might be able to put them on a different developmental trajectory was my big what if question. And what was really remarkable was, so I had been asking John, hey, can I have your spinal fluid samples? And he finally agreed after he saw a couple of those papers. Understandably, he wanted to make sure that we already had shown something in people and animals that were sort of, if you will, symptomatic with social impairment. And what we found was, yes, this was the case. So it was a small sample. It needs to be replicated, but individual. So infants that went on to have an autism diagnosis later in life already had low CSF vasopressin levels. Oxytocin levels did not differ between infants that received a subsequent autism diagnosis and those that didn't. So suggesting that we have a biomarker that might really be a good readout for clinical referral or risk management monitoring."

        "text": "Incredible. So you're telling us that levels of vasopressin correlate with social cognition deficits. I think that warrants a brief discussion about cerebral spinal fluid. I teach neuroanatomy to medical students, so forgive me for having to ask this, but I think of cerebral spinal fluid as the stuff that exists in the ventricles and down the central canal of the spinal cord and provides essential nutrients and for neurons and other cell types in the brain. But it's also a reservoir for chemicals coming from the brain, which is why the spinal tap is useful. But in the context of a cerebral spinal tap, and you're measuring CSF and you're seeing, okay, lower levels of vasopressin in these individuals with these challenges with social deficits, does that. Does that mean that they're making less vasopressin? Does it mean. I mean, it could have gone the other way, too. Like, they're dumping too much vasopressin into the CSF and it's not able to function in the brain. Like, you know, what do we know about CSF and what does it mean?"

        "text": "Right. Well, I mean, it's a great question. So I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. Right. So I think of the CSF is as sort of like the kitchen sink of the brain. Right. And what we need is real specificity. And so, I mean, my working hypothesis, and we'll talk a little bit about pharmacology, is that there's a deficiency in vasopressin production in individuals with autism. But there's a lot of elegant experiments that need to be done to be able to answer this question. So we have funding currently to look in postmortem human brain tissue to look at in both blood CSF and hypothalamic tissue, where vasopressin is made to look at interrelationships, which is very difficult to do, but also to see if there's a fewer number of vasopressin producing cells and if vasopressin gene expression is diminished. Right. Cause that would help us begin to answer, is this a production issue? Right. So if you think back to the prairie voles, they're sort of primed to be parental. Right. Or in my case, the meadow voles. Right. But you can do this in any vole species, or at least the two that I'm thinking. And you put vasopressin into the brain, and then all of a sudden it unlocks this behavior. Right. So is it possible that children with autism are at least a subset of them? All you have to do is replace vasopressin and that there might be a subset of these kids, minimally, that could benefit from vasopressin replacement, if you will."

So, you know, given all these weird medical naming conventions, it's possible that this information is existing in information silos in different disciplines, right? So it raises this idea of, if you have low vasopressin, so if you really don't have. You're not making vasopressin, you have a disorder called central diabetes insipidus, right? Which is characterized by excessive thirst, lots of urination, and bedwetting, potentially. And so what we wanted to do was ask, has this been missed? Right? So shouldn't there be a subset of kids with autism where we might be able to look at these other physiological features and say, yeah, this is the subset we want to be giving vasopressin to. And so she wrote this perspective where we did a little bit of a review, and the answer is, there's some intriguing studies that we reviewed in this paper where it looks like. And what's funny is when you read the discussion section, it'll be like, wow, there's all these kids with autism that are drinking lots of water, and we don't know why. Or, wow, there's a lot of better, but it's not tied to intellectual disability, where you might see a lot of bedwetting or something. So all of these studies kind of raise this point of like, wow, this is really interesting. And there's been no big epidemiological study done on this, and certainly not any study where people who come at it from brain science, and then the practitioners who are, like, an endocrinologist, for instance, which is where some of these people could show up, are really connected. So I think that remains to be determined. But we are actually about to launch a study to investigate this. Right. I was meeting with Lauren yesterday about it. So it's a really good question, and I hope to have information on it in the not too distant future."

And what I would say say is vasopressin means you're having effects on blood pressure. You're having effects on really important vasodilature. And the dosing has to be appropriate. You don't want people just going and trying this because there could be really severe adverse effects. That's why we've been studying this in a controlled clinical trial. I teamed up with Antonio Hardin, who's the child's psychiatrist that I've been working with for years. And we did the first sort of first in class vasopressin treatment trial in children with autism. So again, this was, everyone was unaware of who was on vasopressin, whether it was the family or the clinician who was doing the evaluation. And then it was randomized, placebo controlled. And then we basically gave vasopressin again twice a day for four weeks to children. They were about six to twelve years, years of age. And then we had a primary outcome measure, which was the social responsiveness scale. We could get into discussions about what a primary outcome measure should be. You know, wouldn't it be great if there was a biological measure? But this is sort of what had been used in the past and something that the FDA approved us using. I was partly interested in using the SRS because we had used it in monkeys. Right. And we had shown, at least in monkeys, we've never looked at this in people because of the lack of available samples, but that in monkeys, in this general population that we've looked at, there's a continuous distribution of these SRS scores that relate to the CSF vasopressin levels. And so what was I wanted to know, if we use the SRS as an outcome measure and we're administering vasopressin, can we change the scoring on this instrument based on our animal data?"

And I think most people just want to understand the top contour. The SRS presumably has to do with how often the kid interacts with another kid, how often they initiate that interaction versus, on the receiving end, things like affiliative play, how often they look at one another versus averting gaze, these kinds of things."

So even though it's called the social responsiveness scale, there's also an assessment of other features of autism in it. But you can sort of think about it as a quantitative way to assess features of interest in autism. And this was related to our biology and the monkeys. And so then we use this as this outcome measure in our trial. And as an experimentalist, I have this sort of trust but verify. Right. So you want to see the same thing over and over and over. Again. Right. And so we had parents fill out their impressions of what the child's behavior was before and after being on the medication. We also had a clinician make an evaluation, but we also had the kids perform laboratory based tests where they would see, like I mentioned, the reading the mind in the eyes test, or we would show them a picture of a face and say, what emotions. And so we were able to have what's called convergent validity. Right. So it's a fancy scientific term to say, do all these measures that we think should be related, are they related, and are we seeing the same thing? And the answer was yes. So that when we gave children with autism vasopressin versus kids with autism a placebo, the kids who were treated with vasopressin showed increases in social abilities on parent report, clinician evaluation, and child performance on laboratory based tests."

Right. And so when we started this work, again, it was like, philanthropic shoestring budgets. Right. And so you had to really be laser focused on what are the things that we can do on the budget at hand. So, unfortunately, we didn't do, like, eeg or brain imaging or other things that would be, I think, potentially very interesting to do because you might be able to see an early signature of response. Right. So maybe after the first dose, let's say, wow, like, there's some interesting changes that are predictive of somebody who would be a responder to the medication. And we don't know that yet, but we do know after this four week period that we saw these changes. And then in a subset of kids, we actually saw diminished anxiety and also diminish, restricted, repetitive behaviors. So suggesting that the vasopressin effect may not only be on social behavior."

Are we increasing social motivation, which would suggest from some of the animal studies, may actually be happening? Right. We don't know. And I think that's partly when you have other models or if you're able to do imaging studies. I mean, one thing that's been a little bit of a holy grail in this field is that if we could get tracers that are basically like a molecule, that would allow us to inject it into somebody and then visualize the brain, like, if I'm thinking about a pet trace or a radio ligand, where you could then ask questions about what's happening in the brain. Can we give vasopressin in the context of a functional brain imaging scan and ask, where is the vasopressin binding? What kind of circuits are involved? That needs to be the next step of the work to know where our targets are. And you can do something like functional proteomics, where if you know where vasopressin receptors are, you can overlay that with studies of functional brain imaging. And that would allow you to say these areas are dense in vasopressin receptors. And do we see similar responses in what we call bold signal on a brain scans? So let's be more colloquial about this. Like, do certain areas of the brain light up, if you will, where we know vasopressin receptors are densely distributed in ways that we know are tied to social motivation or social salience or other things that we think could be moving the needle here in the trial. How is this happening? And I think, you know, one thing, the reason why we did this work is, and I think it speaks to what you said earlier, is there is an urgency on the part of parents to say, you know, my child's brain is developing, right? And there's a sense of that, you know, the sort of western model has failed a lot of people. You know, they look to doctors and say, what are the solutions?

And so, you know, one of the reasons why they, they did that big oxytocin study was that people were trying to get the oxytocin anyway. So it was like, let's just make sure that this is safe. Let's see if it's effective. And so some of our thinking was, you know, as soon as some of this work hits, you know, like, and some of the work has been covered by the media. And so, you know, our feeling was we can give this intranasally and we can do it under or safe monitoring ways. And so people are going to think about doing these things anyway. So let's just make sure that this is safe, and let's test this in a rigorous way so we don't know the mode of action. But then our feeling is that at least from the initial safety data, it looks pretty safe. And so the idea would be, and there's a long tradition in psychiatry of we don't know the mechanism of action. But if we have a medication that can be impactful and improve the lives of people with autism, and we can diminish suffering and people can more readily reach their full potential, you know, to me, it actually seems unethical not to move forward in a way that's scientifically sound."

I, I've seen a fair number of studies in mouse models arguing that in a mouse model of autism, which now, frankly, I have to wonder about the power of that model. But anyway, the models are out there in the field. One can take the microbiome. Basically, let's be direct fecal transplants from a. And here I'm using air quotes, non autistic mouse, or a mouse that doesn't have social interactions, deficits, and put that fecal transplant into a host that does have social deficits and rescue some degree of social deficits. I don't know if this has actually been done in humans as well. And for those of you that are cringing, yes, they do fecal transplants in humans for treatment of obesity and a bunch of other things. This isn't because scientists are obsessed with fecal matter. It's because fecal, fecal matter contains a lot of the microbiome elements. So the microbacteria of the gut, and the reason I'm raising this now is one possibility, and it's not mutually exclusive with a brain mechanism, is that the administration of vasopressin somehow rescued a vasopressin deficiency in the gut. So the questions are as follows. Is there any evidence that vasopressin is manufactured in or impacted by the gut microbiome of humans? We'll just start with humans, since I think most, and because that wouldn't be a smoking gun, but it'd be an interesting detective story."

There's, like I said, these genetically modified mice that have genetic syndromes that are where the individuals have social impairments. And some of these individuals, and again, here's a problem with a field. Often they will measure oxytocin, but not vasopressin. So they're not often both measured together, which I always do now. But there's been some really interesting evidence that in these mouse models, that. And again, multiple studies, but like, certainly low blood oxytocin levels in these mouse models and with the sense that maybe they have some sort of abnormal gut microbiome. And then what they've done is they've given a probiotic to these mice, normalize their social functioning, and there's an increase in oxytocin. And in a recent study, also vasopressin at the level of the hypothalamus. So by giving a probiotic, I believe the oxytocin levels were increased in the, the blood. You saw more species typical social behavior, and this was all driven by this upregulation of oxytocin gene expression and also vasopressin in this very recent study. And what's interesting is there's this nerve called the vagus nerve, which is, I think it means the wandering nerve."

No one specific ilis as I always say, because they all seem to end in illus. Multiple illuses, illices, illicit. Here we go again. You upregulate gene expression and thereby action of oxytocin and vasopressin in the hypothalamus. But that's a neural mediated thing. It's not as if the microbiota travel to the brain. Something changes in the gut, which activates the vagal pathway from gut to the specific nucleus in the brain. And we know that the vagal pathway is involved because it seems at least partially necessary. If you sever that, you give a vagotomy, then this effect is blunted or eliminated. That's very interesting. And ties the microbiome to oxytocin, vasopressin production in a neural and somewhat causal way, and makes the data on fecal transplants make a lot of more sense. Cause I was wondering. Okay, so you take the microbiota from one animal, putting them into another animal. You're transferring the milieu of the gut, but it doesn't say anything about mechanism, right? So this is a really cool paper."

It's still very hard for amazing, world class labs like yours to say, hey, listen, there's this vagal thing and clearly there's a rationale. It's not like you're pulling this out of nowhere and you want to go do this study, but what we're really talking about is three to five years of grant writing before you could even initiate that study. Meanwhile, autistic kids are going from age two to five to six. These are critical windows. So if ever there was a. There was a rationale for, you know, moving a lot of funding to, you know, I don't want to even call it high risk, but, you know, logically sound hypothesis testing for the treatment of autism, it's now.

I think it's worth contrasting that work with the fairly large trial that was done by a major pharmaceutical company exploring the role of suppressin for the treatment of autism. You could tell us what they did because it's basically the opposite of what you did. And you can tell us the outcome, because I think that, if anything, that study inadvertently provides support for the results that you observed, which is that administering, let's say, increasing basopressin levels in the brain seems to ameliorate some of the social deficits of autism."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right? So Roche had a compound called balavaptin, which was a vasopressin v one a receptor antagonist, which basically means there's, I think I mentioned there's these four neuropeptide receptors and oxytocin. Vasopressin bind to each other's receptors, but the v one a receptor is the one that is most implicated in social behavior. And so they had. And this is the tricky part about when medications are developed in pharmaceutical versus in academics. Right? In academics, there's definitely this transparency. We write grants. The abstracts are publicly available. We register our trials. They do, too. But a lot of the, shall we say, early development is all put out in publications, right? And then it's also peer reviewed and there's an open trail of why we're doing what we're doing. But in a pharmaceutical company, they have the ability, because also they have all the funding to be able to do all kinds of development that may never see the light of day because of the proprietary dietary basis of it. Right. And so when you go back to. So it still is not clear to me why they took the approach of using an antagonist to the main vasopressin receptor in the brain. What's interesting is if you go back and you look at the animal literature, there are hamsters that if you give them vasopressin, they become aggressive, right? And if you give male prayer voles vasopressin, they can become aggressive. But let's think about the context that they're doing this in. These hamsters that show aggression are asocial. They live by themselves. If you give them vasopressin, and the only social repertoire they have is to, you know, have sex with a female or to fight a male that they see, they have a very limited social repertoire. Right. And when the prairie volume male is being. Is being given vasopressin, it's often in the context of, like, protecting his mate and his offspring. And so then it's actually species appropriate for him to attack a maraudering male on his territory who's going to kill his babies. Right? And so my thinking in reading the preclinical literature, the animal literature, was that, all right, that makes a lot of sense in the context of those species. But we've never seen any evidence in our trial aggression didn't change. We also have an aggression measure in the current trial as well. But for me, the vast majority of evidence from the animal literature suggested that vasopressin was prosocial. And that especially given our CSF findings over and over across species, across studies, across ages, that we should be giving vasopressin, especially given the correlations between vasopressin in CSF and symptom severity and autism, autistic traits, the former in people and the latter in the monkeys. And so they had some preliminary studies that I believe were maybe single dose, one that they published. But then they had a trial where the primary outcome measure, the social responsiveness scale, was negative. And then they had some secondary measures that maybe showed some promise, and then they were conducting another trial. Trial. And then they did a futility analysis. And I know they stopped the trial, and I don't think it was for safety reasons, but again, you know, a lot of this isn't made public, right, because it's a pharmaceutical company. So, you know, we. We will see, because we are going to be completing our larger trial, you know, this year. And, you know, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. So we will see if, you know, we can replicate our initial pilot findings."

Why are you antagonizing the system? And we're giving a vasopressin agonist, if you will.

And so maybe there's some people where they have too much vasopressin and some who have too little. Right?

And I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try and represent all those sides. And one thing that I've heard is that over the last 20 or 30 years, there's been a dramatic increase in the number of vaccinations that kids get. And I don't know if that's true, but when we say vaccinations, we could be talking about measles, mumps, rubella, polio. We could also be talking about measles, bumps for Bella, polio, flu shots every year, rabies vaccine, tetanus vaccine, hpv. Hpv, right. With one that wasn't even available when I was in college, as everyone in college who was well aware there wasn't an HPv vaccine didn't change people's behavior a whole lot. But there's a vaccine, there's multiple vaccines, and then there's, you know, all the vaccines, right? And I think that one of the concerns that I hear about is the idea that, okay, there are some critical vaccines, but then which ones are perhaps less critical, if any? And these are the kinds of discussions that are starting to surface and that, you know, have parents and potential parents, you know, rightfully thinking about this stuff, and no one really knows where to get the information. I've tried, and I can't find a pediatrician that says, hey, listen, these, but not those. Or you can certainly find board certified physicians that say many, and certain board certified physicians that say none, you actually can find those. The none category tend to hide themselves a little bit more than others, for obvious reasons. But it's hard to get a sense of which vaccines are critical and which ones aren't if you're a parent and you're not versed in this stuff.

But I think that, like you said, with this cancel culture and all this fear, scientists sometimes will pick topics very judiciously based on, you know, like, hey, I just want to be left in peace, and I'm trying to help this community. And if there is areas of the enterprise that you think are going to cause all kinds of grief, then people are going to be less reluctant to study them, even if it's critically needed."

        "text": "Well, that's a perfect place to say thank you. I realize you're not addressing the vaccine autism issue directly, but you're so clearly going after the target, trying to figure out what are the biological mechanisms that are disrupted in autism and by extension, other deficits of social function in kids and adults. You've identified this incredible relationship between which should have more prominence in my opinion than oxytocin, its lesser cousin. Just kidding. Oxytocin lovers. But also have shown, yes, in a small study. But youre now extending this to a larger cohort. As you mentioned, a causal relationship. When vasopressin is administered to these low vasopressin, low social functions, kids, their symptoms improve. So I know I speak for many people when I say that I truly appreciate your doggedness in going after this problem, especially on the complicated landscape of lack of funding for doing novel and truly high risk work, especially on the backdrop of the socio political landscape around autism. It's a complicated thing even to discuss. As I mentioned in the introduction, you know, we had to have some fluency around autism. So we sometimes said autistic, sometimes we said people with autism, I mean, it's a tough one. But in order to make progress, real progress in this area, we need people like you. We need you and you're doing it to get in there and just go, okay, let's get at the biological functions, let's get at the novel treatments. And you're making amazing progress. So I'm so grateful that you're doing it and that you'll continue to do it and that you came here today to teach us what you've been up to. I'm oh so grateful. And I just want to say thank you for that and that we absolutely have to get you back here to give us an update on your progress really soon. And again and again and again."

I do read all the comments. Please also check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning and throughout today's episode. That's the best way to support this podcast. Not so much on today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman lab podcast, we discuss supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving sleep, for hormone support, and for improved focus. To learn more about the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, go to livemomentous spelled O u s so livemomentous.com huberman if you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman Lab on Instagram X, formally called Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads. And at all of those places I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is to stay from the content covered on the Huberman Lab podcast. So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels. If you haven't already subscribed to our neural network newsletter, our neural network newsletter is a zero cost newsletter that comes out every month. It includes podcast summaries as well as protocols in the form of short PDF's of maybe just one to three pages where I list out the specific protocols, for instance, for improving dopamine functioning, or for improving your sleep, or for deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure, or fitness protocols, and on and on, all of which are presented in brief fashion, very direct, just the protocols listed out, again, completely zero cost. To sign up, you simply go to hubermanlab.com, comma go to the menu function, scroll down to newsletter, and enter your email. And I should point out that we do not share your email with anybody. Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with Doctor Karen Parker. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science."
