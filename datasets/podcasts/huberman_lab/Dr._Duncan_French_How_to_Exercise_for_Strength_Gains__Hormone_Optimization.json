        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Doctor Duncan French as my guest on the Huberman Lab podcast. Doctor French is the vice president of performance at the UFC Performance Institute and he has over 20 years of experience working with elite professional and Olympic athletes. Prior to joining the UFC, French was the director of performance science at the University of Notre Dame, and he has many, many quality peer reviewed studies to his name, exploring, for instance, how the particular order of exercise, whether or not one performs endurance exercise prior to resistance training or vice versa, how that impacts performance of various movements and endurance training protocols, as well as the impact on hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and some of the stress hormones such as cortisol. He's also done fascinating work exploring how neurotransmitters, things like dopamine and epinephrine, also called adrenaline, can impact hormones, and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release. What's particularly unique about doctor French's work is that he's figured out specific training protocols that can maximize, for instance, testosterone output or reduce stress hormone output in order to maximize the effects of training in the short term and in the long term. So today you're going to learn a lot of protocols, whether or not you're into resistance training or endurance training. You will learn, for instance, how to regulate the duration of your training and the type of training that you do in order to get the maximum benefit from that training over time. So whether or not you are somebody who just exercises recreationally for your health, whether or not you're an amateur or professional athlete, or whether or not you're just trying to maximize your health through the use of endurance and or resistance training, today's discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you. There are only a handful of people working at the intersection of elite performance mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way that leads to direct, immediately applicable protocols that anybody can benefit from. Doctor French also provides some incredibly important insights about the direction that sport and exercise are taking in the world today and their applications towards performance and health. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greenshouse. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With athletic greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D three, k two there are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium. But it has no sugar. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function, neuron function, as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body. If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized. If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low, we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise. Our mood is off, hormone systems go off. Our ability to get into physical action, to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished. So with element, you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element. That's lMnt.com huberman and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase. They're all delicious. So again, if you want to try element, you can go to elementlmnt.com Huberman today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the Waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on the which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now my conversation with Doctor Duncan French. Duncan French, great to see you again."

And certainly science doesn't have all the answers, but I just think it's so rare to find somebody that's at the convergence of all those different fields.

Right at the end of the day, it's about having confidence, having expertise, and being able to deliver that expertise, in my world, to athletes. And I think that's what I've always tried to do. I've tried to have many strings to my bow so that I can talk with many different hats on the, you know, one day I'm talking to a coach, next time talking to an athlete. The next day I'm talking to a CEO, the next day I'm talking to an academic professor. So I think being able to wear those different hats is certainly a skill set that I've tried to build throughout my career. And like I said, I've been blessed to work with. I think it was 36 different professional or Olympic sports last time I counted. So, yeah, it's been a wild ride. It's been great."

Great experience working with kids, developing athletic qualities. But something in the back of my mind always, I wanted more. I wanted to be at the higher end of elite sport. I was a failed athlete. Like many people, I represented my country in different sports and things, but I never made it professionally. So, you know, that little seed was sown in as much as I then started to reach out to different areas to do a PhD, whether it was in the UK or also chanced my arm, took a punt, see if I could get over to the states. All my buddies were going on gap years after the finnish university or whatever and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever, traveling through Thailand. And I figured, well, I've always loved the states and can I go and kill two birds with 1 st and do something academic, continue my studies but also do it in a different environment and get some life, life experience. And then many, many rejections, as I'm sure you're kind of aware from different professors, whether it was Roger nor ker or, you know, William Cramer."

And I transferred with him and, yeah, four great years with my PhD and getting my PhD with a really prolific research group that looked at neuroendocrinology, hormonal work, but using resistance training primarily as an exercise stressor as a major mechanism, and then looking at all the different physiologies off the back of resistance training."

I have a question about this. I'll just inject a question about weight training and hormones. You hear this all the time, that doing these big heavy compound movements or resistance training increases androgens, things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA and so forth. Does anyone know how that actually happens? Like, what about Mov? What about. What is it about? Engaging motor neurons under heavy loads sends a signal to the endocrine system, hey, release testosterone. I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook."

It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress. And these are downstream regulation of testosterone release at the gonads comes from many different areas. You know, my work primarily looked at, you know, catecholamines and sympathetic arousal."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "That raises an interesting question. So, in presumably weight training in women, people who don't have testes, also, it increases testosterone. And is that purely through the adrenals, when women lift weights, their adrenal glands release testosterone?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Absolutely. I mean, that is the only area of testosterone release for females. And yes, it's the same downstream cascade. Obviously, the extent to which it happens is significantly less in females. But that's how you. There's good data out there that shows, you know, females can increase their anabolic environment, their internal anabolic milieu, using resistance training as a stressor, and then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth, you know, whether it's tendon ligament adaptations, you know, the beneficial consequences of resistance training, which is driven by anabolic stimuli."

        "speaker": "A",

The first one is something that you mentioned, which is that the androgens, the testosterone comes from the adrenals under resistance loads in women. Is the same true in men. I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone when we weight train for men that have testes. But do we know whether or not it's the adrenals or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone more? Both a little bit from each."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "The field is divided presently in as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response in terms of anabolic response to exercise in an acute phase, and the exposure to a stimulus that is stress driven, which might be partly from the adrenal glands, partly from the gonads, versus a longitudinal exposure to anabolic environments, which is primarily driven by, obviously, the gonads, and the release of the endocrine environment from testosterone release at the gonads. The field is split in terms of how exercise is promoting hypertrophy, muscle tissue growth, and whether that is very much an adrenals stimuli or if that's significant enough in these acute responses versus the longitudinal exposure, just elevated basal levels of anabolic testosterone habitual level."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So it sounds like in most cases, like with most things, it's probably both. It's probably the adrenals and the gonads. And then you mentioned that testosterone can have enhancing effects, growth effects on tendon and ligament, also that you don't often hear about that. People always think testosterone muscle. But testosterone has a lot of effects on other tissues that are important for performance, it sounds like. Yeah, what's the story there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Absolutely. I mean, I think the testosterone hormone is. I mean, listen, there's androgen receptors on neural tissue, on neural axons, pretty much everywhere. Exactly. So the binding capacity of testosterone and influence in different tissues within the body. I touched on muscle tissue, but the ligaments, the tendons, even bone, to some extent, testosterone is potential to influence that in terms of removing osteopenic characteristics, etcetera. So, yeah, it's a magic hormone, let's say, with many end impacts in terms of adaptation."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I definitely want to get back to your trajectory, but as long as we're on the interactions between androgens, testosterone and its derivatives and different tissues. From the work that you did as a PhD student and throughout your career, could you say that there are some general principles of training that favor testosterone production? In terms of that somebody who's not an elite athlete could use somebody who's already adapted to weight training, somewhat like they know the difference between a dumbbell and a barbell. And they know the various movements, they're not going to damage themselves. But once they're doing that, I mean, I've heard of shorter sessions are better than longer sessions, but in rep loads there's a lot of parameter space. But if you were going to throw out some of the, um, the parameters that you think are most important to pay attention to for the typical person who's trying to use weight training to build or maintain muscle."

And as much as testosterone is really stimulated by an intensity factor and also a volume factor, now growth hormone is a little bit different. That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone."

Not only is it wrong, it's usually backwards. So no trust. I know, trust your instinct because. Because I think people just make this stuff up because it's very hard to measure growth hormone and testosterone. And I can't imagine most of the stuff that I see out there, they're taking drips and measuring free versus bound and all this kind of stuff. But that's what you do in laboratories, right? Yeah."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "You look at total composition, then you look at how much of that is free circulating in the system, how much is bound and therefore biologically active, bound to receptor, creating adaptation. But yeah, coming back to testosterone in terms of the training strategies, it's largely driven by both an intensity and a volume factor. So if you look at many of the exercise interventions that we use to try and investigate and interrogate testosterone, it was usually a six by ten protocol."

So, you know, multi joint, you know, challenging exercise, multi muscle, multi joint, 80% load of your one repetition max, and then six by ten. We did play around with your classic german volume type, ten by ten kind of protocols, but they were just unsustainable at that 80%. The key to what we also did was we always adjusted the load to make sure that it was ten repetitions that were sustained. So if the load was too high and an athlete or a participant had to drop the weights on the 6th repetition, we would unload the bar and make sure they completed the ten repetitions. Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity and a volume derivative that is going to be most advantageous for testosterone release."

And one thing that you mentioned there is especially interesting to me, which is you said when you go from six sets of ten repetitions to ten sets of ten repetitions, it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive. But to me, the difference between six and ten sets is only four sets. It doesn't even sound that much. That sort of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from a workout that increases testosterone to a workout that diminishes testosterone is actually a pretty narrow margin."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. And I think it comes back to that intensity factor. Then what we saw, that ten by ten protocol really sees pretty significant drop offs in the load. And again, we're trying to stimulate with intensity, with mechanical strain through intensity, as well as metabolic strain through volume. And I think that's the paradigm that you've got to look at, is that the mechanical load has to come from the actual weight on the bar and the volume is the metabolic stimulus. How much are we driving lactate? How much are we driving glycogenolysis in terms of that type of energy system for executing a ten by ten protocol? And what we often saw was just a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that. So we shortened the volume to try and maintain the intensity."

I tell myself I'm going to work out for 45 minutes and then 2 hours later I'm done. But not because I was huffing and puffing the whole time, but because I was training really slowly. Is there any evidence that training slowly can offset some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, it's the old adage of, you know, two responses to your question. I mean, the first one, I would say, you know, there's a difference between ten sets of six and six sets of ten. And I think that comes back to the volume conversation. You know, six sets of ten is driving up metabolic stimulus. If you're doing ten sets of six, you can probably take it to a higher intensity, but you're not going to get the same metabolic load, you're not going to get the same internal metabolic environment that drives the lactate release that they will then signal, you know, further anabolic testosterone release because of the lactate in your body. That's a key consideration. The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked out there in general population and in many sporting environments. The rest is as important a programming variable as the load and the intensity, the load, the volume, etcetera. And yes, if you extend the volume, if you extend the duration of your rest periods, what you're ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again. You're allowing the flushing of the body, the removal of waste products, you know, lactate to be, you know, removed from the body, and then the metabolic environment is reduced."

        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So the way that I've been training, slow and lazy is not necessarily the best way to go. I could, in theory, do a 45 or 60 minutes session where I pack in more, more work per unit time. I'm not going to be able to, quote unquote, perform as well. I won't be able to lift as much. I have to unweight the bar between sets, or maybe even during sets, if I have someone who could do that. But it sounds like that's the way to go, so it's got to be. So this, the old adage of high intensity short duration is probably the way to go, correct."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And, you know, in layman's terms, if the same objective, the same training goal is just muscle tissue growth, and we're not talking about maximal strength or any of those type of parameters, we're just talking about growing muscle. If there's an athlete a and they do six sets of ten with two minutes rest. And there's athlete B that does six sets of ten with three minutes rest. Athlete a will likely see the highest muscle gains, muscle hypertrophy gains, because of the metabolic stimulus that they're driving with the shorter rest periods."

For all the years that I've spent exploring exercise science and trying to get this information from the Internet in various places, that this is the first time it's ever been told to me clearly.

About two minutes, get the work in and then I'll derive the benefits."

As humans, we want to, you know, we want to take that rest, we want to take the, the time out to recover and feel refreshed. But we're trying to create a training stimulus. We're trying to create a very specific stimulus internal to the body, and that is often driven by the metabolic environment at that moment in time. Now, if we allow the metabolic environment to change by extending the rest periods, we're not going to see as beneficial gains at the end of it. Very interesting. It is very much a motivational and ego thing. Rather than saying, okay, I'm going to push my loads as high as I can and really challenge maximal strength, do fewer repetitions take longer periods of time? It's a completely different approach to training. It's a different end goal."

Because it does seem that athletes who take high levels of exogenous androgens can do more work and just get protein synthesis from just doing work. You know, I've seen these guys in the gym, right, that tell tale signs are not that hard to spot, where they're just doing a ton of volume, not necessarily moving that much weight. They're just bringing blood into the. Into the tissue, and then they're loading up on, they're eating a ton of protein, presumably because they're basically in puberty. Part 15."

How many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress?"

Right, so 80%, you know, if your maximum at a young training age is still 80% versus, you know, I've been training ten years, it's still 80%. But yes, the mechanical load is going to be significantly. It's just more tonnage. Right. But yeah, I think a protocol like that we would look at two times a week, something that's pretty intensive like that. Because, again, it comes back to the point you make is that you really need to be, if you want a better term, suffering a little bit through that type of protocol, both in terms of the challenge of the load, but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress that you're exposed to. It's a bit of a sicko feeling, right, because of the lactate that you're driving up. So, you know, I wouldn't promote, as an athlete doing that type of modality, you know, multiple, multiple times, unless you're from the realms of bodybuilding, and then you really, that that's the sole purpose of what you're trying to achieve. Most athletes in most sports have diverse requirements in terms of outcomes that they're trying to achieve. They're not just targeting muscle growth. Muscle growth is a. A conduit to increase strength, increased power, increased speed, obviously. So, yes, trying to get bigger, cross sectional area of a muscle means that we can produce more force into the ground, or wherever it may be, if we're a locomotive athlete. But usually sports men and women are not just purely seeking muscle growth. They look for different facets of muscle endurance or maximal muscle power, muscle strength. So then you've got to be very creative in how you build the workout? If it's a bodybuilder, absolutely. They're chasing muscle growth and they're going to do so with these types of protocols, which sees high intensities and high volumes of workload on a pretty regular basis. If it's just somebody, a weekend warrior that wants to keep in shape and look good, I would say two times a week for a really challenging workout like that, and then flex the other types of workouts within the week to have more of a volume emphasis where you reduce the intensity and you might just look at, at larger rep ranges from twelve to 15 to 20. Another workout where you're looking at reducing the volume but increasing the intensity and really trying to drive different stimulus to give you more endpoints of success."

And since you have a background in catecholamines and testosterone. Last time I was here at the UFC Performing Institute, we had a brief conversation and I want to make sure I got the details right, that in the short term and a big increase in stress hormone can lead to an increase in testosterone. Like a. Like a parachute jump. Correct. But so stress can promote the release of testosterone. That was news to me. We always hear about stress suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing the immune system, all these terrible things. But in the short term, you're saying it can actually increase the release of testosterone. So I have that right? Correct. And so then the second question is, does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor make a difference? In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute, does it have a different effect on my testosterone than if you shove me out of the plane against my will? Presumably with a parachute. Right, too."

And it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers. There was an older study looking at parachute jumpers into, into, into combat, and they were studying the cortisol, the stress response and the epinephrine response of these parachute jumpers. So we got us thinking about, hold on, there's certain workouts that you do that are just the daunting. It's like, okay, it's squat Saturday, or whatever it may be. Oh, my gosh, this is going to."

They knew there were going to be some physical distress from doing it, and therefore their mindset of how they were going to approach that was already set. So what we saw 15 minutes prior to the start of an exposure, the workout that the epinephrine, the neuradrenaline, the adrenaline was already starting to prepare the body sympathetically to go into what it knew was going to be a very, very challenging workout. So that brings you back to, you know, exercise preparation, competition for certain preparation, preparation for certain competition. Excuse me, you know, pre workout routines, the use of music, you know, all these different things that we know can now anecdotally in the gym we put into place. But the data that I presented showed that it was the first of its kind to show that this link between epinephrine and norepinephrine release and arousal and then consequent performance.

And I think that was the intriguing part of some of my findings were there's definitely an individual biokinetics to some of these hormonal kind of releases. In as much as those guys that had the highest adrenergic response in terms of epinephrine release, norepinephrine release also sustained force output for a longer period of the workout than those that didn't. So the individuals that had a lower stimulus of the sympathetic arousal, let's say, certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout. Now, the intriguing thing then becomes, is okay. And I think this really segues into what we're doing here with combat athletes, with mixed martial artists. There's a philosophy, there's a paradigm now from myself in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure, that the more you do that challenging workout, do you get the same psychological stimulus? Do you still get the same stress response? And the assumption is unlikely. You accommodate, you become accustomed to the stressor. Your body will therefore adapt. And that's the classic overload principle. You then need to take the stressor down a different route. But I think when you look at the athletes that we work with here, it's a fistfight at the end of the day. There's nothing more stressful than that. But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training to understand the bad positions, the bad situations, to know that they can get out of certain situations, out of certain submission holds or whatever it may be. I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work in terms of what these guys do to approach what is a really challenging sporting arena in mixed martial. Laughs."

Because, yeah, like you said, at the end of the day, it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can within the bounds of the rules, and you're trying to do the same. So that's, you know, I find that your thesis work fascinating. Were you never to be at the UFC Performance Institute? Luckily, they made the right choice and brought you here, but where you have never to come here. I was still fascinated by this because over and over we hear that stress is bad. Stress is bad, stress is bad. But everything I read from the scientific literature is that stress and epinephrine in particular is coupled to the testosterone response to performance and to adaptation, provided it doesn't go on too long. So unless I'm saying something that violates that, I mean, that's your work. So it's really important and beautiful work, and I refer to it often. So I'm just glad that we could bolt that down because I think people need to know this, that discomfort is beneficial. Now, there's another side to this that I want to ask about, which is the use of cold in particular things like ice baths, cold showers, or any other type of the cold temperature exposure. You know, in theory, that's stress. Also, it's epinephrine. And so how should one think about the use of cold for recovery? So if it's stress, how is. If stress, if colds causes stress, then how is cold used for recovery? That's what I don't understand. And maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that."

But I think, you know, when we talk about stress, it's your classic fight, flight or freeze approach. And, you know, throwing your body into, you know, a cold tub, an ice bath or whatever it may be, certainly is going to have a physiological stress response. Now, people are using that for different end goals. And again, I think that's where the narrative has to be explained. If you are using the stress specifically to manage the mindset, to use it as a specific stress stimulus, that's the same as me doing six by 1080 percent. You know, you're just trying to find something to disrupt the system, to do something that's very, if you want a better term, painful discomfort, whatever, you're just finding a stressor and then being able to manage the mindset. But if you're using cold specifically from a physiological perspective to promote a, you know, redistribution of vascularity of blood's flow to different vascular areas of muscle that you feel have gone through a workout that are damaged or whatever it may be, I think we've got to understand what that stress mechanism is. And the data, the literature is certainly still out there with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths and some of these high, these cold exposures in terms of what they do at the level of the muscle tissue, if that's the target, if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism or you're trying to promote redistribution of the blood flow, what you've got to understand is that cold is going to clamp down every part of the vascular system and we've really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed to areas of interest. So I think the stress response is a real thing with respect to cold exposure. But I think the narrative around what are you using the cold for? Has to precede the conversation, because, yes, it's like putting your hand over a hot cold. That's a stress the same way as jumping in a cold bath is."

When do you use cold? You know, should you be using cold for recovery in periods of high training load, when you're actually pursuing, you know, maybe general preparatory work, we're actually trying to pursue muscle growth. Well, that's usually where you get the most sore. It's usually where, you know, you feel the most fatigue. But it's probably not the most beneficial approach to use an ice bath in that. In that scenario, because you're dampening, you're dulling the, you know, the mtor pathway and the hypertrophic signaling pathway, whereas in a competition phase, where actually quality of exercise and quality of execution of skill and technical work has to be maintained, you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery capabilities and recovery interventions in that scenario, because the muscle building activity should be in the bank. That should have been done in the general preparatory work, and now you're focusing on technical execution. So you're absolutely right."

But if I'm, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do this, but if I were to do an ironman or something or run a marathon under those conditions, I'm basically coming to the, to the race, so to speak, with all the power and strength I'm going to have.

I think just education around where science is at and our understanding of concepts like the use of cold exposure for recovery. Ice bath. You know, everyone wants to jump in an ice bath. But I think as we've stepped back and scientists have started to say, have started to figure out and look at some of the data, you know, we're now more intuitive about, well, actually, that might not be the best or the most optimal approach, and I think that's, that's any given sport. So, yes, certainly here at the UFC, we're trying to educate our athletes around, you know, appropriate timing, and it's the same with nutrition. It's the same with an ice bath intervention. It's the same with lifting weights. It's the same with going for a run or working out on the bike, you know, there's tactics to when, when you do things and when you don't do things. And I think, you know, stress and cold exposure, we have to have a consideration around that as well. But it's not just, you know, MMA fighters that's any, any athlete. And I think it's the best. The best professionals, the most successful professionals do that really well. They understand, they listen. Number one, they educate themselves, and then they build structure. And I think, you know, at the most elite level, we always talk about it here at the UFC, but the most elite level, you're not necessarily training harder than anybody else. Everybody in the UFC trains hard. Like, everyone is training super hard. But the best athletes, the true elite levels, are the ones that can do it again and again and again on a daily basis and sustain a technical output for skill development. Therefore, their skills can improve or physical development. Their physical attributes can improve. So that ability to reproduce on a day to day basis falls into a recovery conversation. Now, when is the right time to use something like an ice bath? And when isn't is part of the high performance conversation for sure."

It's truly a decathlon of combat. So there's so many different attributes, whether it's a grappling, whether it's a wrestling, whether it's the transition work, whether it's a stand up striking. So the different facets of a training program in this sport are significantly large compared to something like, you know, a wide receiver in football. And that's no disrespect for wide receivers, but they run routes, they, they're going to run a passing tree, and that's all they need to do. These guys have to be on the ground. They've got to be great on the ground. They've got to be great standing up. They've got to be great with the back against the fence. There's so many different kind of facets to our sport. So managing the distribution of all the training components is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts. And the best guys get that right. They allow their body to optimize the training. And remember, why are we doing training? We're doing training for technical and tactical improvement. Now, if your body is fatigued or you just can't expose yourself to more tactical development or technical development, then you're essentially doing yourself a disservice.

What's kind of interesting, sometimes I talk to athletes and they seem a little bit laid back about their training sometime, and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch and they can really dial in the intensity. Do you think that there are optimal protocols for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning? Like, could it ever be parameterized, like the six sets of ten reps? And this gets to the heart of neuroplasticity, which is still, it's not a black box, but it's kind of a black box with portions of it illuminated, I like to say. But what are your thoughts on skill development? Is there for somebody that wants to get better at sport? Do you recommend a particularly long or short training session? It.

I tend to default to Doctor Gabrielle Wolf here at UNLV for that. She's one of the leading proponents in this area. But if you look at the, you know, true skill development, it is about rehearsal of accurate movement, accurate movement mechanics. And as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue or inaccurate movement, you're now losing the motor learning, you're losing the accuracy of the skill that, you know, people can call it muscle memory or whatever they want, right? But essentially, you're grooving neural axons to create movement patterns, and they're situational throughout sport, right? You know, whether it's a Cruyff turn in soccer or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line, you can carve out that particular posture and position and skill, and you can isolate it and you can drill it again and again, again. Now, as soon as fatigue is influencing that repetition, it's time to stop. And the best coaches understand that. They understand that it's quality over quantity when it comes to skill acquisition. So, to answer your question in a roundabout way, I would say yes, it's shorter sessions that are very high quality. And I think the best athletes in my experience are the ones that consciously and cognitively are aware of it. At every moment of the training session, they should leave the training session not necessarily just physically fatigued, but mentally fatigued because they're completely engaged in the learning process. The problem then becomes okay if we just do lots of, you know, 30 minutes sessions. We've got to do a lot of 30 minutes sessions to get the volume exposure of the repetition and the rehearsal of this skill again and again and again. So it's a bit of a paradox. It's a bit of a double edged sword, but, you know, a three hour session versus a 90 minutes session, you know, we'll take the 90 minutes session any day when it comes to skill acquisition because that's going to be driven by quality over quantity."

I'm talking figuring things out, figuring out the skill and I think that can be stressful. Like the learning process can be stressful. So we've touched on stress. I also think if they, if they, if they hit the right technique, you know, that reward center in the brain, that dopamine shot is going to fly up there and there's only so many times that we can get that before that becomes dampened. And I think there's an energetic piece to it. You know, there's the fueling of, of the brain. There's the, there's the carbohydrate fueling exercise that actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning and fuel for physical training is actually pretty similar."

To come back to the original question, if it's a general population, then yes, I think there's a place to argue that actually being on a ketogenic diet at times, and maybe it's a cycling exercise, maybe not. I don't mean cycling a bike. I mean cycling ketosis is beneficial because I think it's going to lead to better metabolic management and better efficiency. Those lower intensities where we should be fueling our metabolism with lipids and fats. Clearly, the western diet and the modern day diet is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates that people become predisposed to utilization of that fuel source above. Lipids use fat use intensities that are very low. So some of our data with the fighters shows as well. But I think the challenge for us is that we're working with a clientele that require high intensity bouts of effort. So, you know, fueling appropriately is very important for that. Now, we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes on what you would say, kind of, is it largely a ketogenic diet? But then we will fuel carbohydrates around training sessions.

It's ludicrous. Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency. I think some people might be familiar with that term, some perhaps not. But the way I understand metabolic efficiency is that you teach the body to use fats by maybe doing long bouts of cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit. So teaching the body to tap into its fat stores for certain periods of training, and then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates. By supplying carbohydrates immediately after training and before training, you teach the body to use ketones, and then you use them at the appropriate time, as opposed to just deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others are bad or dispensable. Do I have that correct?"

        "text": "You nailed it. I mean, from Bob Sieberhar, as formerly of USA triathlon, is the guy that kind of came up with the concept of metabolic efficiency. But yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, at low intensities of exercise or just day to day living, we shouldn't be tapping into our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively. That's for higher intensity work or the fight or flight needs of stress. If athletes or any individual has a high carbohydrate diet, they're going to start to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel source preferentially. Now, at low intensity. That can be problematic, certainly for an athlete, because if they preferentially use carbohydrate at lower intensities, when the exercise demand goes to a higher intensity, they've already exhausted their fuel stores. They can't draw upon fat because the oxidization of that fat is just too slow. So they're essentially now become fatigued because they've already utilized the carbohydrate stores. So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation and a little bit of exercise manipulation, is, as you say, teach the body or train the body to preferentially use a specific fuel source, fat, obviously, at lower intensities, and carbohydrate at high intensities. And we look at specifically, the crossover point between the two tells a lot in terms of how an athlete is ultimately how their metabolism is working."

I think most people are looking for that one pattern of eating, that one pattern of exercising that's going to be best for them or sustain them. And they often look back to the time when they felt so much better switching from one thing to the next. But the adaptation process itself is also key. Right. Teaching the body so if we were to just riff on this just a little bit further, if somebody, I'll use myself as an example since I can only speculate what other people, uh, current nutrition protocols are, but if somebody is eating in a particular way and they want to try this kind of periodization of nutrition, um, could one say, okay, for a few weeks Im going to do more high intensity interval training and weight training and Im going to eat a bit more carbohydrate because Im depleting more glycogen. Then if I switch to a phase of my training where Im doing some longer runs, maybe Im not, maybe Im training less, maybe Im just working at my desk a little bit more more, then I might switch to a lower carbohydrate diet. Do I have that right? And then if I'm going to enter a competition of some sort, certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind, to be clear, uh, not because it isn't a wonderful sport, but because it's, that wouldn't be good for my other profession.

We probably need to be cut. It's going to be lower intensity work or even just habitual day to day walking around doing your groceries. You know, that that doesn't require massive amounts of glycogen storage and carbohydrate fueling. So you can potentially go more ketogenic in nature, you know, oxidizing lipids for that fuel. If you are in a high period of high intensity training then you have to consciously flex your diet to support that. That's not normal. You've made a change, you've elevated the demand. So the fueling requirements for the regenerative, not only fuel in the exercise, but the regenerative requirements of your body after that type of work. Is going to be really important as well. So, yes, take on more carbohydrates. So I think it's consciously interpreting the nature of your diet against what where you are at any moment in time like that."

The bigger fights, maybe two times a year, but invariably the guys don't know when that next date is going to be. So we're in this gray area of, okay, what do we do?

And, okay, I've got to ramp everything up really quickly. So that's a real challenge in terms of just managing all these different components of mixed martial arts alone. To come back to your question, the other thing which is truly fascinating about these individuals is just their mental resilience. And again, we've touched on it in the talk, but the ability to do what they do on a daily basis, to look at all the different skill sets that they have to try and engage in and bring into their training, to do that and embrace the grind, embrace the process of just learning the physical side of our sport is unprecedented. But the mental side, we have a funny saying. We always say it's 90% mental apart from the 60% that's physical. So it's just more and more and more.

And sometimes it goes pathological. Right? And this. I don't say this as a criticism. It's just that most human beings within our species, most members of our species, never learn to either flip the switch or to just voluntarily toggle between states.

And the other one is, how does one get better at heat adaptation? Or at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat? How long does that take?

Ultimately, their ability to sweat and to lose body fluids is going to be advantageous to their weight cut process, their ability to make weight. It is a technique that some of these guys adopt. So if you don't have, you know, high sweat rates, it means you're going to have to sit in the sauna for longer and longer and longer to get the same delta in sweat release. So the more acclimated you are, the more your body is thermogenic, genically adapted. The more sweat glands you have, there's more pores, you can sweat more and therefore you'll lose that fluid quicker and you spend less time in the sauna. So that's why we do it, to try and promote the, to limit the exposure. And it comes back to your first question, is it a stressor? It's absolutely. It's a stressor. If you've got to spend, you know, 2 hours over, you know, over a four hour period, 2 hours of it sat in a sauna because you just."

So, you know, we start with 15 minutes and then we just try to add on and add on across a time. And now, now for us, we kind of found about 14 sauna exposures starts to really then drive the adaptations that we're looking for. So it's not a quick fix. You know, a heat acclimation strategy has to happen long before fight week or long before the fight. You know, this is a, this is a process that has to begin, you know, eight to ten weeks before the fight so that we can actually get the, that adaptation and that tolerance to the stressor, to the exposure of heat."

Now, I didn't realize that but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it that heat adaptation is possible, that you're basically can train the body to become better at cooling itself which is what sweating is. I should have known that before but you don't see that in the textbooks."

You're training your butt like the body is, you know, as an organism, as an organic system, it's, it's hugely adaptable. It's usually plastic. But I think the skill is understanding the when's, the whys and the whereofs in terms of changing the overload, changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation. And philosophically that's how we go about our work here. We talk about adaptation led programming. Now adaptation led programming fits into every single category, not just lifting weights or running track. It fits into nutrition, it fits into sitting in the sauna, it fits into being in a cold bath or not. It fits into so many different things because we're driven by scientific insights and that's how we really want to go about our business."

And I think there's a lot here that's applicable to the recreational athlete too. Yeah, that. Would you say that, you know, what comes to mind is twelve weeks. It feels like twelve weeks is a nice block of time for someone to try something in terms of to try something new, see how they adapt, adapt and then maybe switch to something new. I realize that it's very hard to throw a kind of pan time frame around something, but in terms of if someone wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or experiment with cold adaptation or change up their training regimen or diet and look at metabolic efficiency, do you think twelve weeks is a good period of time to really give something a thorough go and gain an understanding of how well or how poorly something works for oneself? Or would you say eight is enough? Or three?"

Twelve week intervention is, is more than adequate to say for 99 of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or an overload stimulus, you're going to start to see either regression or progression, you know, beneficial or detrimental effects within three months. Absolutely. I would say so. Now, listen, I say that in as much as we do training blocks here that are three weeks long, that's because."

Do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload, that like super condensed exposure? Now, we might be doing that purposefully. We might be trying to do an overreaching strategy where we're really trying to damage or flex something. And I don't mean like negatively damaged, but like, we're trying to damage tissue to really get an adaptive response versus, you know, more drawn out twelve week strategy, which is more coherent, more planned out, more structured in nature. Yeah. For all your listeners, I would say if twelve weeks to engage in a process of trying to change and adapt your body or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient to see if it's going to be the right approach for you. And I think the individual interpretation always has to be considered. And I think that's where it comes back to be a thinking man's athlete or be a thinking man's trainer. Like someone that's going through exercise, you have to consciously understand where your body's at any moment in time. You know, you've got to be real with yourself. You create a journal, create a log of your training, create a log of your feelings, your subjective feedback of, you know, how you felt, your mood, your sleep."

You know, some people will tolerate it, some people are going to be challenged by it. Some people have got a metabolic makeup that's going to promote it. Some people are metabolically challenged by it. You know, there's just so many different things that we have to consider, and that's what we try to do here. It's the cross we bear is that we try to understand on an individual level how to optimize athletic performance."

And most people out there, you know, I've certainly been trying to encourage people to learn some science and some mechanism and become scientists of their own pursuits, whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, et cetera. As a sort of a final question, what are some things about the UFC or something about the UFC that perhaps people don't know in terms of its overall mission or what you guys are trying to do here? I mean, I think I've become a fan of MMA, and I am more and more as time moves on. Some people might be into MMA, some people not into watching MMA, but what are some things that the UFC is interested in and doing a that most people might not know about and certainly I might not know about?"

You know, we think we've got an amazing platform here, particularly at the performance institute, to do some really cool things that can inform many different people. And I don't. That doesn't just mean the 600 or so athletes that are on our global roster. What we're trying to do is influence global community around optimizing human performance. So any moment in time, we're engaging in different technologies with different vendors, different partners, exploring opportunities to learn more, share data, understand what's the best mechanisms for interpreting your body, interpreting how your body's responding to training, interpreting your nutrition, or whatever it may be. We're in a really privileged position to do that, but we've also. Hence, you've been here today. We're also trying to venture into some really cool areas of science and research that's got applicability that you can take from high performance athletes and apply to yourself, to Joe Blow walking down the street out there, that is really interesting. That's everything from whether it's CBD and psychedelics through to different technologies for thermal monitoring and bluetooth, heart rate monitoring or whatever it may be, through to data management, etcetera, and anything in between. We've got some great partners on the nutrition side, on the psychology side, on the data side, and I think we always try to just push the envelope a little bit more. I think we keep our core mission with our athletes, but I think a lot of what we do, hence your podcast and an amazing platform, you do such a great job of it that we can all learn and take from the elite and interpret how it might help us just in the general population. I think that's our north star, is to provide our athletes the best integrated service of care. But we also want to influence just the global community. Put UFC at the forefront of that."

Duncan, look, I have this filter that I use when I talk to people, academics or otherwise, which is some people, they open their mouth and it make much difference. But when you speak, I learn so much. I'm going to take the protocols that I've heard about today. I'm going to think about how I'm training and how I could train differently and better, how I'm eating, how I could eat different, differently and better for sake of performance and just in general.
