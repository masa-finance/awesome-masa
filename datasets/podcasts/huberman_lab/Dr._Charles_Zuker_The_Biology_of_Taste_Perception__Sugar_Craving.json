        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Charles Zucker. Doctor Zucker is a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience at Columbia University School of Medicine. Doctor Zucker is one of the world's leading experts in perception. That is, how the nervous system converts physical stimuli in the world into events within the nervous system that we come to understand as our sense of smell, our sense of taste, our sense of vision, our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing. Doctor Zucker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount of pioneering and groundbreaking work in the area of perception. For a long time, his laboratory worked on vision, defining the very receptors that allow for the conversion of light into signals that the rest of the eye and the brain can understand. In recent years, his laboratory has focused mainly on the perception of taste. And indeed, his laboratory is responsible for discovering many of the taste receptors leading to our perception of things like sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami. That is, savoriness in food. Doctor Zucker's laboratory is also responsible for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst. That is how the nervous system determines whether or not we should ingest more fluid or reject fluids that are offered to us. A key feature of the work from Doctor Zucker's laboratory is that it bridges the brain and body. As you'll soon learn from today's discussion, his laboratory has discovered a unique set of sugar sensing neurons that exist not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons that sense sweetness and sugar within the body, and that much of the communication between the brain and body leading to our seeking of sugar, is below our conscious detection. Doctor Zucker has received a large number of prestigious awards and appointments as a consequence of his discoveries in neuroscience. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American association for the Advancement of Science. He is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. For those of you that are not familiar with the so called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis, and indeed, they have to come back every five years and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed as Howard Hughes investigators. Doctor Zucker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989. What all that means for you as a viewer and or listener of today's podcast is that you are about to learn about the nervous system and its ability to create perceptions, in particular, the perception of taste and sugar sensing from the world's expertise on perception and taste. I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast, you are not just going to come away with a deeper understanding of our perceptions and our perception of taste in particular. But indeed, you will come away with an understanding of how we create internal representations of the entire world around us, and in doing so, how we come to understand our life experience. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast and now for my discussion with Doctor Charles Zucker. Charles, thank you so much for joining me today."

        "text": "I want to ask you about many things related to taste. Our first sponsor is athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With athletic greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D three k too there are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin D three and k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D three k two today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element, and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium, but it has no sugar. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function, neuron function, as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body. If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium present in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized. If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low, we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise. Our mood is off, hormone systems go off. Our ability to get into physical action, to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished. So with element, you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element. That's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase. They're all delicious. So again, if you want to try element, you can go to elementlmnt.com hubermanda. Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions for those of you who don't know yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still, but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations. And there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep, deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com Huberman to access a free 30 day trial and gustatory perception. But maybe to start off, and because you've worked on a number of different topics in neuroscience, not just taste, how do you think about perception? Or rather, I should say, how should the world and people think about perception? How it's different from sensation and what leads to our experience of life in terms of vision, hearing, taste, etcetera."

And this mind changes the human condition. It changes. It transforms fear into courage, conformity into creativity, sadness into happiness. How the hell does that happen? Now, the challenge that the brain faces is that the world is made of real things. This here is a glass, and this is a chord, and this is a microphone. But the brain is only made of neurons that only understand electrical signals. So how do you transform that reality into nothing? That electrical signals that now need to represent the world? And that process is what we can operationally define as perception in the senses, let's say, olfactory, other, taste, vision. We can very straightforwardly separate detection from perception. Detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule, you put it in your tongue, and then a set of specific cells now sense that sugar molecule. That's detection. You haven't perceived anything yet. That is just your cells in your tongue interacting with this chemical. But now that cell gets activated and sends a signal to the brain, and now detection gets transformed into perception. And he's trying to understand how that happens. That's been the maniacal drive of my entire career in neuroscience. How does the brain ultimately transform detection into perception so that it can guide actions and behaviors? Does that make sense?"

I think many people would like to know whether or not, my perception of the color of your shirt is the same as your perception."

        "text": "I like the one way penalize. Now, given what I told you before, that the brain is trying to represent the world based in nothing but the transformation of these signals into electrical languages that now neurons have to encode and decode, it follows that your brain is different than my brain, and therefore, it follows that the way that you're perceiving the world must be different than mine, even when receiving the same sensory cues. Okay, and I'll tell you about an experiment. It's a simple experiment, yet brilliant, that demonstrates how we perceive the world different. So, in the world of vision, as you know, well know, we have three classes of photoreceptor neurons that sense three basic colors, red, blue, and greenhouse blue, green, and red, if we go, you know, from short to long wavelength, and these three are sufficient to accommodate the full visible spectra. I'm going to take three light projectors, and I'm going to project one into a white screen, a red light, and the other one, green light. I'm going to overlap the two beams, and on the screen, there's be yellow. Okay, this is super position when you have two beams of red and green. And then I'm going to take a third projector, and I'm going to put a filter that projects right next to that mixed beam, a spectrally pure yellow. And I'm going to ask you to come to the red and green projectors and play with the intensity knobs so that you can match that yellow that you are projecting to the spectrally pure next to it. Is this making sense?"

If I give you the smell of a rose, you can describe it to me. If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also. But I have no way whether the two of us are experiencing the same. But it's close enough that we can both pretty much say that it has the following features or other determinants. But no question that your experience is different than mine."

He's never been on this podcast, but in the review that I read by Marcus, at one point, he said that the basic function of perception is to divide our behavioral responses into the out comes downstream of three basic emotional responses. Yum, I like it. Yuck, I hate it. Or meh, whatever. What do you think about? I'm not looking to establish a debate between you, Marcus, without Marcus here."

And this variation in perception from one individual to the next at once seems like a problem, because we're all literally seeing different things, and yet we function. We function well enough for most of us to avoid death and cliffs and eating poisons and so forth, and to enjoy some aspects of life, one hopes. So. Is there a general statement that we can make about the brain, not just as a organ to generate perception, not just as an organ to keep us alive, but also an organ that is trying to batch our behaviors into general categories of."

But again, I think the role of Marcus, too, and I think he's right, that, broadly speaking, you could categorize a lot of behaviors falling into those true categories, and that's 100% likely to be the case for animals in the wild, where, you know, the choices are not necessarily binary, but they're very unique and distinct. Do I want to eat this? Do I want to kill that? Do I want to go there? Or do I want to go here? We humans deviated from that world long ago and learned to experience life where we do things that we should not."

We like living on the edge. We love enjoying experiences that makes us human. And that goes beyond that simple set of categories, which is yummy, yucky. Ah, who cares? And so I think it's not a bad palate, but I think it's overly reductionist for certainly what we humans do."

And since we're here in New York, I can say that the many options, the extensive variety of food, flora, and fauna in New York explains a lot of the more nuanced behaviors that we observe. Let's talk about taste, because while you've done extensive work in the field of vision, and it's a topic that I love, we could spend all day on, taste is fascinating. First of all, I'd like to know why you migrated from studying vision to studying taste.

Ideally, I like to help contribute to understand all of it. You know, how do you encode and decode emotions? How do you encode and decode memories and actions? How do you make decisions? How do you transform detection into perception? And the list goes on and on. One of the key things in science, as you know, is ensuring that you always ask the right question so that you have a possibility of answering it. Because if the question cannot be tractable or reduced to an experimental path that helps you resolve it, then we end up doing some really fun science, but not necessarily answering the important problem that we want to study.

I can come up with ways to think about it, but I like to understand what in your brain makes someone a great philanthropist. What is the neural basis of love? I wouldn't even know where to begin. So if I want to begin to study these questions about brain function that can cover so many aspects of the brain. I need to choose a problem that affords me that window, but in a way that I can ask questions that give me answers. And among the senses that have the capacity of transforming detection into perception of being store as memories, of creating emotions, of giving you different actions and perceptions as a function of the internal state. You know, when you're hungry, things taste very differently than when you're sated. How? Why? When you taste something, you now remember this amazing meal you had with your first date. How does that happen? All right, so if I want to begin to explore all of these things that the brain does, I felt I have to choose a sensory system that affords some degree of simplicity in the way that the input output relationships are put together, and in a way that still can be used to ask every one of these problems that the brain has to ultimately compute, encode, and decode. And what was remarkable about the taste system at the time that I began working on this is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste. You know, we knew that we could taste what has been usually defined as the five basic taste. Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Umami is a japanese word that means yummy, delicious, and that's nearly every animal species. The taste of amino acids. And in humans, it's mostly associated with the taste of MsG, monosodium glutamate, one."

And so the beautiful thing of the system is that the lines of input are limited to five, you know, sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami. And each of them has a predetermined meaning. You are born liking sugar and dislike. In bitter, you have no choice. These are hardwired systems. But of course, you can learn to dislike sugar and to like bitters. But in the wild, let's take humans out of the question. These are 100% predetermined. You're born with that specific valence value for each taste of sweet. Umami and low salt are attractive taste qualities. They evoke appetitive responses. I want to consume them. And bitter and sour are innately predetermined to be aversive."

        "text": "Could I interrupt you just briefly and ask a question about that exact point? For something to be appetitive to and some other taste to be aversive, and for those to be hardwired. Can we assume that the sensation of very bitter or activation of bitter receptors in the mouth activates a neural circuit that causes closing of the mouth, retraction of the tongue, and retraction of the body? And that the taste of something sweet might actually induce more licking."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "100%. You got it. The activation of the receptors in the tongue that recognize sweet versus the ones that recognize bitter activate an entire behavioral program. And that program that we can refer as appetitiveness or aversion, it's composed of many different subroutines. In the case of bitter, it's very easy to actually see them happening in animals, because the first thing you do is you stop licking, then you put unhappy face, then you squint your eyes, and then you start gagging. And that entire thing happens by the activation of a bitter molecule in a bitter sensing cell in your tongue."

        "text": "It's again, the magic of the brain. You know, how it's able to encode and decode these extraordinary actions and behaviors in response of nothing but a simple, very unique sensory stimuli. Now, let me say that this palette of five basic tastes accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism. Sweet, to ensure that we get the right amount of energy. Umami, to ensure that we get proteins, another essential nutrient. Salt. The three appetitive ones, to ensure that we maintain our electrolyte balance. Bitter, to prevent the ingestion of toxic, nauseous chemicals. Nearly all bitter. Taste. You know, things out in the wild are bad for you. And sour most likely to prevent ingestion of spoiled, acid fermented foods. And that's it. That is the palate that we deal with. Now, of course, there's a difference between basic taste and flavor. Flavor is the whole experience. Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes coming together together with smell, with texture, with temperature, with the look of it, that gives you what you and I would call the full sensory experience. But we scientists need to reduce the problem into its basic elements so we can begin to break it apart before we put it back together. So when we think about the sense of taste and we try to figure out how these lines of information go from your tongue to your brain and how they signal and how they get integrated and how they trigger all these different behaviors, we look at them as individual qualities. So we give the animals sweet, or we give them a bitter, we give them sour. We avoid mixes because the first stage of discovery is to have that clarity as to what you're trying to extract so that you can hopefully, meaningfully make a difference by being able to figure out how is it that a goes to b, to c, and to d?

And that one chord, in the case of a piano, leads to a note, a tune of. And in the case of taste, leads to an action and a behavior.

        "text": "There are many views, but the most prevalent is that there was an original drawing describing the sensitivity of the tongue to different tastes. So imagine I can take a Q tip. This is a thought experiment, and I'm going to dip that Q tip in salt and in quinine as something bitter and glucose as something sweet. And I'm going to take that Q tip, ask you to stick your tongue out and start moving it around your tongue and ask you, what do you feel? And then I'm going to change the concentration of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter and ask, can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity to the different tastes? And the argument that has emerged is that there is a good likelihood that the data was simply mistranslated as it was being drawn. And, of course, that led to an entire industry. This is the way you maximize your wine experience, because now we're going to form the vessel that you're going to drink from so that it acts maximally on the receptors, which happen. All right, now there is no tongue map. All right? We have taste bats distributed in various parts of the tongue. So there is a map on the distribution of taste bats, but each taste bud has around 100 taste receptor cells. And those taste receptor cells can be of five types, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, or umami. And for the most part, all taste buds have the representation of all five taste qualities. Now, there is no question that there is a slight bias. For some, taste like bitter is particularly enriched at the very back of your tongue. And there is a teleological basis for that, actually a biological basis for that. That's the last line of defense before you swallow something bad. And so let's make sure that the very back of your tongue has plenty of these bad news receptors, so that if they get activated, you can trigger a gagging reflex and get rid of this. That otherwise may kill you."

And once they interact, then they trigger the cascade of events, biochemical events inside the cell that now sends an electrical signal that says, there is sweet here or there is salt here. Now, having these receptors and my laboratory identify the receptors for all five basic taste classes, sweet, bitter, salt, umami, and most recently, sour. Now, completing the palate, you can now use these receptors to really map where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way. This is no longer about using a q tip and trying to figure out what you're feeling, but rather what you have in your tongue. This is not a guess. This is now a physical map that says the sweet receptors are found here, the bitter are found here, and when you do that, you find that, in fact, every taste bad throughout your oral cavity has receptors for all of the basic taste classes."

Olfactory neurons in your nose is the other example. So then a yes, you're burning a lot of your cells, and it's over for those. The good news is that they're going to come back. But we know that when you burn yourself with tea, they come back within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour. And these cells are not renewing in that timeframe. They're not listening to your needs. They have their own internal clock. And so you are really affecting. You're damaging them in a way that they can recover. And then they come back and you also damage your somatosensory cells.

Or in this case, of that stimuli. And you take sweet. Sweet has a quality, an identity, and that's what you and I will refer to as the taste of sweet. We know exactly what it tastes like, but sweet also has a positive valence, which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive, but is attractive and appetitive, as I'll tell you in a second, independent of its identity and quality. In fact, we have been able to engineer animals where we completely remove the valence from the stimuli. So these animals can taste sweet, can recognize it as sweet, but it's no longer attractive. It's just one more chemical stimuli. And that's because the identity and the valence are encoded in two separate parts of the brain.

There is an area of your brain that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortex, and a different area that represents the taste of bitter. In essence, there is a topographic map of these taste qualities inside your brain. Now we're going to do a thought experiment. All right? Now if this group of neurons in your cortex really represents the sense of sweet and this other different group of neurons in your brain represents the taste, the perception of bitter, then we should be able to do two things. First, I should be able to go into your brain, somehow silence those neurons, find a way to prevent them from being activated, and I can give you all the sweet you want, and you'll never know that you're tasting sweet. And conversely, I should be able to go into your brain, come up with a way to activate those neurons.

So that raises the question for me, of whether or not those separate sets of neurons are connected to areas of the brain that create this sense of valence, or whether or not they're simply created connected, excuse me, to sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors of moving towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive. Are we essentially interpreting our behavior and our micro responses, or are micro responses in our behaviors the consequence of the percept?"

And the sweet neurons go to a different area than the beta neurons. Now, I want to do a thought experiment, because I think your audience might appreciate this. Let's say I activate this group of neurons, and the animal increases, leaking, and I'm activating the sweet neurons. And so that's expected, because now it's, you know, tasting this water as it was sugar. Now this is Moses transforming water into wine. In this case, we're gonna. And today's Passover. So then it's an appropriate, you know, example. We're transforming it into sweet. Yeah, but how do I know. How do I know that activating them is evoking a positive feeling inside, a goodness, a satisfaction, I love it. Versus I'm just increasingly leaking, which is the other option, because all we're seeing is that the animal is leaking more, and we're trying to infer that that means that he's feeling something really good, versus you know what? That piano line is going back straight into the tongue, and all it's doing is forcing it to move faster. Well, we can actually separate this by doing experiments that allow us to fundamentally distinguish them. And imagine the following experiment. I'm going to take the animal, and I'm going to put them inside a box that has two sides, and the two sides have features that make him different. One has yellow little toys, the other one has green toys. One has little, you know, black stripes. The other one has blue stripes. So the animal can tell the two halves, I take the mouse, put them inside this arena, this play arena, and it will explore and put around both sides with equal frequency. And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to activate these neurons, the sweet neurons, every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes. And if that is creating a positive internal state, what would the animal now want to do? It will want to stay on the side with the yellow stripes. There's no leak in here. The animal is not extending its tongue every time I'm activating these neurons. This is known as a place preference test, and it's generally used. It's just one form of many different tests to demonstrate that the activation of a group of neurons in the brain is imposing, for example, a positive versus a negative valence. Whereas if they do the same thing by activating the bitter neurons, the animal will actively want now to stay away from the side where these neurons are being activated."

Can I have the phone number for sushi Ota, please? And then she'll give it to you over the phone, at least in the old days. And then you need to repeat it to yourself over and over and over, over the next minute, so you can dial sushi otae, and five minutes later, it's gone. That's what we call working memory.

A single event is so traumatic that it activates the circuits in a way that it's a one trial learning. And the taste system is literally at the top of that food chain. And there is a phenomenon known as conditioned taste aversion. You can pair an attractive stimuli with a really bad one, and you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike, for example, sugar. And that's because you've conditioned the animals to now be averse to this otherwise nice taste, because it's been associated with malaise. And when you do that, now you can begin to ask, what has change in the signal as it travels from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you have now transformed sweet from being attractive to being aversive.

Because flavor involves smell, texture, temperature and some other features. Uni, sea urchin being a good example of. I can sense the texture. It actually, I won't describe what it reminds me of for various reasons. The ability to place context on, into insert context into a perception, or rather, to insert a perception into context, is so powerful, and there's an element of kind of mystery about it. But if we start to think about some of the more nuanced that we like to live at the edge, as you say, how many different tastes on the taste dial. To go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial, do you think that there could be for something as fixed as bitter? So, for instance, I don't think I like bitter tastes, but I like some fermented foods that seem to have a little bit of sour and have a little bit of that briny flavor. How much plasticity do you think there is there? And in particular across the lifespan? Because I think one of the most salient examples of this is that kids don't seem to like certain vegetables, but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes. And yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables is because of some knowledge that vegetables might be good for you, better for them. So is there a change in the receptors, the distribution, the number, the sensitivity, et cetera, that can explain the transition from wanting to avoid vegetables to being willing to eat vegetables simply in childhood to early development?"

        "text": "I'm going to take the question slightly differently, but I think it will illustrate the point. And I want to just use the difference between the olfactory system and the taste system to make the point. Taste system, five basic palates, sweets, our birth. Each of them has a predetermined identity. We know exactly what valines, these are attractive, these are aversive. In olfactory system. It's claimed that we can smell millions of different odors, yet for the most part, none of them have an innate predetermined meaning. In olfactory system, meaning is imposed by learning and experience, even the smell of smoke. So I'm going to give you. I'm going to make it differently. There are a handful of the millions of others that were claimed that you could immediately tell me these are aversive and these are attractive vomit. So vomit. It's not correct, because I can assure you that there are cultures and societies where things which are far less appealing than vomit do not evoke an aversive reaction. Really? Really. Sulfur would be maybe a universal. I'm not talking pheromones, okay? Pheromones are in a different category that trigger innate responses. But nearly every other is afforded meaning by learning and experience. And that's why you like broccoli. And I despise broccoli because I remember my mother forcing me to eat broccoli. Same sensory experience. This accommodates two important things. In the case of taste, you have neurons at every station that are for sweet, for sour, for bitter, for salty and umami. It's only five classes, so it's not going to take a lot of your brain. If we can in fact smell a million others and everyone else of others had to have predetermined meaning. There's not going to be enough brain just to accommodate that one sense. And so evolution, in its infinite wisdom, evolve a system where you put together a pathway and a cortex, olfactory cortex, where you have the capacity to associate every other in a specific context that now gives it the meaning. Now let's go back to the original question then. So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic, because it's fundamental basis and neural organization. But taste, we just told you that predetermined hardwire. But predetermined hard wire doesn't mean that it's nothing modulated by learning or experience. It only means that you are born, like in sweet and dislike, in bitter. And we have many examples of plasticity. Beer being one example. So why do we learn to love beer is in coffee. It's because it has an associated gain to the system. And that gain to the system. That positive valence that emerges out of that negative signal is sufficient to create that positive association. And in the case of beer, of course, is alcohol. The feeling good that we get after is more than sufficient to say, I want to have more of this. And in the case of coffee, of course, is caffeine activating a whole group of neurotransmitter systems that give you that high associated with coffee. So, yes, the state system is changeable, it's malleable and is subjected to learning and experience. But unlike the olfactory system, it's restricted in what you could do with it, because its goal is to allow you to get nutrients and survive. The goal of the olfactory system is very different, is being used not in our case, but in every animal species, to identify friend versus foe, to identify mate, to identify ecological niches they want to be in. So it plays a very broad role that then requires that it be set up, organized and function in a very different type of context. Taste is about can we get the nutrients we need to survive? And can we ensure that we are attracted to the ones we need and we are averse to the ones that are going to kill us? I'm being overly simplistic and reductionist, but I think it illustrates a huge difference between these two chemosensory systems."

And I'll tell you an experiment that you could do that demonstrates this, I think in. In. I think it's good for the, you know, for. For your audience here to get a sense of how we approach this problem so that we can get meaningful scientific answers. So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain. We know where the taste cortex is in the brain. They're in two different places. We can go to each of these two cortices, put color traces. We put green in one, we put red in the other, and we see where the colors go to. That's a reflection of where those neurons are projecting to, into their next targets. Once they get the signal, where do they send the signal to? And then we reason that if odor and taste come together, somewhere in the brain, we should find an area that now is getting red and green color. And we found such an area. And next, we anticipated. We hypothesized that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse, corresponding area in the brain of humans that integrates odor and taste. It's known the term normally uses multisensory integration. And if this is true, we could do the following experiment. We can train a mouse to lick sweet, and if they guess correctly that that is supposed to be sweet, they should go now to the right port, to the right side to get a water reward. If they go to the left when it was sweet, then they are incorrect and they get no reward, and they actually get a timeout. Now, the mice are thirsty, so they're very motivated to perform. And if you repeat this task a hundred times, a hundred trials, incredibly enough, this animal learn to recognize the sweet and execute the right action. And by their action, we now are being told what that animal is tasting. We can make it more interesting, and we can give him sweet and bitter and say, if it's sweet, go to the right, and it's better go to the left. And after you train him, this mice, with 90% accuracy will tell you when you randomize now the stimuli what was sweet and what was bitter. All right, we can now do the same experiment, but now mix taste with odorous and say, if you got other alone, go to the right or push this lever in mice. If you get taste alone, go to this other part or push this other lever. And if you get the two together, do this something else. And if you train the mice, the mice are able now to report back to you when it's sensing taste alone, odor alone, or the mix. Make sense."

They still should be able to recognize the other alone, but should be incapable now to recognize the mix. And exactly as predicted, that's exactly what you get. All right."

The visual system, there are a couple of phenomenon that I wonder if they also exist in the taste system. In the visual system, we know, for instance, that if you look at something long enough and activate the given receptors long enough, that object will actually disappear. We offset this with little micro eye movements, et cetera. But the principle is a fundamental one, this habituation or desensitization. Everyone seems to call it something different, but you get the idea. Of course, in the taste system, I'm certainly familiar with eating something very, very sweet for the first time in a long time, and it tastes very sweet. But a few more licks, a few more bites, and now it tastes not as sweet with olfaction. I'm familiar with the odor in a room I don't like or I like, and then it disappearing. So similar phenomena. Where does that occur? And can you imagine a sort of system by which people could leverage that, because I do think that most people are interested in eating not more sugar, but less sugar."

That is, the cells in your tongue that are sensing that sugar as you activate this receptor, and it's triggering activity after activity after activity. Eventually, you exhaust the receptor. Again, I'm using terms which are extraordinarily low."

        "text": "Sake of the discussion, the receptor gets to a point where it undergoes a set of changes, chemical changes, where it now signals far less efficiently, or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell. And now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar will trigger far less of a response, and that is a huge side of this modulation. And then the next, I believe, is the integrated, again, loss of signaling. That happens by continuous activation of the circuit at each of these different neural stations. You know, there is, from the tongue to the ganglia, from the ganglia to the first station in the brainstem, a second station in the brainstem to the thalamus, then to the cortex. So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling. Now, you might say, why? If this is a label line, why do you need to have so many stations? And that's because the taste system is so important to ensure that you get what you need to survive, that it has to be subjected to modulation by the internal state. And each of these nodes provides a new site to give it plasticity and modulation, not necessarily to change the way that something tastes, but to ensure that you consume more or less or differently of what you need. I'm going to give you one example of how the internal state changes the way the taste system works. Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations, and that's because we need it. It's our electrolyte balance requires salt. Every one of their neurons uses salt as the most important of the ions, with potassium to ensure that you can transfer these electrical signals within and between neurons. But at high concentrations, let's say ocean water is incredibly aversive, and we all know this because we've gone to the ocean. And then when you get it in your mouth, it's not that great. However, if I solved the pry view and we can do this in experimental models quite readily. Now, this incredibly high concentration of salt, one molar sodium chloride, becomes amazingly appetitive and attractive. What's going on in here? Your tongue is telling you, this is horrible, but your brain is telling you, I don't care, you need it. And this is what we call the modulation of the taste system by the internal state."

Why? Because if you're thirsty and you have no water, you will die within a week or so. But you can go on a hunger strike as long as you have water for months because you're going to eat up all your energy reserves. Water is a different story. So you could see that there are multiple layers at which the taste system that guides our drive and our motivation to consume the nutrients we need has to be modulated in response to the internal state. And, of course, internal state itself has to be modulated by the external world. And so that, I think, is a reason why what could otherwise would have been an incredibly simple system, from the tongue to the cortex in one just wire. It's not because you have to ensure that each step, you give the system that level of flexibility, or what we call in neuroscience, plasticity."

This is the only way that the brain can ensure that every one of those organs are working together in a way that we have healthy physiology. Now, this monitoring of the brain has been known for a long time, but I think what hasn't been fully appreciated, that this is a two way highway where the brain is not only monitoring, but is now modulating back what the body needs to do. And that includes all the way from monitoring the frequency of heartbeats and the way that inspiration and aspirations in the breathing cycle operate to what happens when you ingest sugar and fat. Now, let me give you an example again of, of how the brain can take what we would refer to contextual associations and transform it into incredible changes in physiology and metabolism. Remember Pavlov? So, Pavlov, in his classical experiments in conditioning, you know, associative conditioning, he would have take a bell. It would ring the bell every time he was going to feed the dog. And eventually, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food coming. Now, the first incredible finding he made is the fact that the dog, now in the presence of the bell alone, will start to salivate, and we will call that, neurologically speaking, an anticipatory response. Okay, I could understand it. I get it. Neurons in the brain that form that association now represent food is coming. And they're sending a signal to motor neurons to go into your salivary glands to squeeze them. So you release, you know, in our saliva because, you know, food is coming. But what's even more remarkable is that those animals are also releasing insulin in response to a bell. Okay, this illustrates one part of this two way highway, the highway going down. Somehow the brain created these associations, and there are neurons in your brain now that no food is coming, and send a signal somehow all the way down to your pancreas that now it says, release insulin because sugar is coming down. All right, this goes back to the magic of the brain. It's a never ending source of both joy and intrigue. How the hell do they do this? Okay. I mean, the neurons."

But the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor of this orchestra of physiology and metabolism. All right, now let's go to the gut, brain and sugar. May we, please?"

On and on and on. There are calming pathways, so called parasympathetic pathways, within the vagus. But I think that the more we learn about the vagus, the more it seems like an entire set of neural connections as opposed to one nerve. I just wanted to just mention that because I think a lot of people have heard about the vagus. Turns out, experimentally in the laboratory, many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus to create states of alertness and arousal when animals, or even people believe it or not, are close to dying or going into coma. Stimulation of the vagus is one of the ways to wake up the brain, counter to the idea that it's just this way of calming oneself down."

So the vagus nerve is made out of many thousands of fibers, you know, individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle. And it's likely, as we're speaking, that each of these fibers carries a slightly different meaning. Not necessarily one by one, maybe five fibers, ten fibers, 20 d. All right? But they carry meaning that's associated with their specific task. This group of fibers is telling the brain about the state of your heart. This group of fiber is telling the brain about the state of your gut. This is telling your brain about its nutritional state. This your pancreas, this, your lungs. And they are, again, to make the same simple example, the keys of this piano. Yes, you're right. There is a lot of data showing that activating the entire vagal bundle has very meaningful effects in a wide range of conditions. In fact, it's being used to treat untractable depression, those stimulator, epileptic seizures. But again, there are thousands of fibers carrying different functions. So to some degree, you know, this is like turning the lights on the stadium, because you need to illuminate where you lost your keys under your seat, yet 10,000 bulbs of a thousand watts each have just come on. Only one of these is pointing to where. And so I'm lucky enough that one of them happened to point to my. So here you activate the bundle thousands of fibers. I'm lucky enough that some of those happen to do something to make a meaningful difference in depression or to make a meaningful difference in epileptics. But it should not be misconstrued as arguing that this broad activation has any type of selectivity or specificity. We're just lucky enough that among all the things that are being done, some of those happen to change the biology of these processes. Now, the reason this is relevant, because the magic of this gut brain axis is the fact that you have these thousands of fibers really doing different functions. And our goal, and along with many other great scientists, including Steve Liverless, that started a lot of this molecular dissection on this vagal gut brain communication line at Harvard, is trying to uncover what are each of those lines doing? What are each of those keys of this piano playing?"

The part that hasn't been yet developed, and that it needs a fair amount of work. But it's an exciting, thrilling journey of discovery, is how the signal comes back to now change that biology. You know, the example I gave you before with Pavlov's dog. All right, I figure out how the association created this link between the bell, but then how does the brain tell the pancreas to release in the right amount of insulin? Okay, so tell me, tell me. Let me tell you about the gut brain axis and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat. Insatiable for sugar, unquenchable for fat. And this is a story about the fundamental difference between liking and wanting. Liking sugar is the function of the taste system. And it's not really liking sugar, it's liking sweet, wanting sugar. Our never ending appetite for sugar is the story of the gut brain axis. Lichen versus wanting. And this work is work of my own laboratory that began long ago when we discovered the sweet receptors. And you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors. So, in essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet. A life without sweetness. How horrible. And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet, and we're going to put either sugar or an artificial sweetener, all right, they both are sweet. They have slightly different tastes, but that's simply because artificial sweeteners have some off tastes. But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned, they both activate the same receptor, trigger the same signal. And if you give an animal an option of a bottle containing sugar or a sweetener versus water, this animal will drink ten to one from the bottle containing sweet. That's the taste system. Animal goes, samples. Each one leaks, a couple of leaks, and then says, uh uh, that's the one I want. Because it's repetitive and because I love it."

They will leak to know from the sweet side, ten to one at least, versus the water. Make sense? All right, now we're going to take the mice and we're going to genetically engineer it to remove the sweet receptors so these mice no longer have in their oral cavity any sensors that can detect sweetness, be it a sugar molecule, be it an artificial sweetener, be it anything else that tastes sweet. And if you give this mice an option between sweet versus water, sugar versus water, artificial sune versus water, it will drink equally well from both because it cannot tell them apart, because it doesn't have the receptors for sweet. So that sweet bottle tastes just like water. Makes sense."

Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, very little from the water, knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them. Mouse can no longer tell them apart, and they will drink from both. But if I keep the mouse in that cage for the next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later and I see what the mouse is leaking or drinking from. That mouse is drinking almost exclusively from the sugar bottle. How could this be? He cannot taste. It doesn't have sweet receptors. During those 48 hours, the mouse learned that there is something in that bottle that makes me feel good, and that is the bottle I want to consume. Now, how does the mouse identify that bottle? It does so by using other sensory features. The smell of the bottle, the texture of the solution inside sugar at high concentrations is kind of goopy. The sideness in which the bottle is in the cage, it doesn't matter what, but the mouse realized there is something there that makes me feel good, and that's what I want. And that is the fundamental basis of our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar, and is mediated by the gut brain axis. The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop immediately, suggesting a post ingestive effect. So we reason, if this is true, and it's the gut brain axis that's driving sugar preference, then there should be a group of neurons in the brain that are responding to post ingestive sugar. And lo and behold, we identify a group of neurons in the brain that does this. And these neurons receive their input directly from the gut brain axis, from other neurons. You got it. And so what's happening is that sugar is recognized normally by the tongue, activates an appetitive response. Now you ingest it, and now it activates a selective group of cells in your intestines that now sends a signal to the brain via the vagal ganglia that says, I got what I need. The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need. It only knows that you tasted it. This knows that it got to the point that it's going to be used, which is the gut. And now it sends the signal to now reinforcement the consumption of this thing, because this is the one that I needed. Sugar, source of energy."

Since they don't activate the gut brain axis, they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar like sugar does. And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners have failed in the market to curb our appetite, our need, our desire for sugar, is because they beautifully work on the tongue, the liking to recognize sweet versus non sweet.

So if I understand you correctly, artificial sweeteners are, and I agree, are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing. And yet, if we trigger this true sugar evoked wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced this, then we eat sugar and we find ourselves wanting more and more sugar.

And so we need to come up with strategies that can meaningfully change the activation of these circuits that control are wanting, certainly in the populations at risk, and this gut brain circuit that ultimately, you know, it's the lines of communication that are informing the brain the presence of intestinal sugar.

Sugar, fat, and amino acids are building blocks of our diets, and this is across all animal species. So it's not unreasonable, then, to assume that dedicated brain circuits would have evolved to ensure their recognition, their ingestion, and the reinforcement that that is what I need. And indeed, you know, animals evolve these two systems. One is the taste system that allows you to recognize them and trigger this predetermined, hardwired, immediate responses. Yes. Oh, my goodness. This tastes so good. It's so sweet. I personally have a sweet tooth, may I add? And, you know, oh, my God, this is so delicious. It's fatty. Or umami. Recognizing amino acid. So that's the lichen pathway. But in the wisdom of evolution, that's good, but doesn't quite do it. You want to make sure that these things get to the place where they're needed and they are not needed in your tongue, they are needed in your intestines, where they are going to be absorbed as the nutrients that will support life. And the brain wants to know this, and he wants to know it in a way that he can now form. The association between that that I just tasted is what God word needs to be. And it makes me feel good. And so now, next time that I have to choose to what should I eat, that association now guides me to that's the one I want. I want that fruit, not that fruit. I want those leaves, not those leaves. Because these are the ones that activate the right circuits that ensure that the right nutrients got to the right place and told the brain, this is what I want, a need. Are we on? We're on."

Why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement, given that I can taste it in a second? You want to make sure that this source of sugar, for example, in the wild, is the best, is the richest, is the one where I get the most energy for the least amount of extraction, the least amount of work.

You know, you take a tangerine and you take an extract of tangerine that you used to cook that spike, let's say, with sugar, and you equalize in both, where they both provide the same amount of calories. If you eat them both, they're going to have a very different effect in your gut brain axis and your system. Once you make the extract and you process it and you add it, processed sugar, you know, to use it now to cook, to add, to make it really sweet tangerine thing. Now you're providing, now fully ready to use, broken down source of sugar. In the tangerine, that sugar is mixed in the complexity of a whole set of other chemical components. Fiber, long chains of sugar molecules that need a huge amount of work by your stomach, your gut system, to break it down.

It doesn't mean they don't enjoy it, but it's a completely different story. I have too many favorite foods because I enjoy the sensory experience rather than the food itself. To me is the whole thing. It's from the present day. Look, there have been these experiments done in psychophysics. I'm going to take a salad made out of eleven components, and I'm going to mix them all up in a potpourri of greens and other things here. And in the other one, I'm going to present it in a beautiful arrangement, and I'm going to put it behind a glass cabinet, and I'm going to sell them. And I'm going to sell one for $2 and one for $8. Precisely the same ingredients, exactly the same amount of each. Ultimately, you're going to mix them. They're all going to be the same, and people will pay the $8 because you know what? It evokes a different person. It gives you the feel that, oh, my goodness, I'm going to enjoy that salad. So going back to what is my favorite food, to me, eating is really a sensory journey. I don't mean the everyday, let me have some, you know, chicken wings because I'm hungry. But every piece I think as an important evoking, sensory role. And so, you know, in terms of categories of food, you know, I grew up in Chile. Yes, meat has always been, but I eat it so seldom now."

I'm talking seven days a week. Chile in Argentina, you know, that's the mainstay of our diet. Now maybe I have red meat. I know, once every four weeks."

And I love your answer because it really brings together the many features of the circuitries and the phenomenon we've been talking about today, which is that while it begins with sensation and perception, ultimately it's the context. And that context is highly individual to person, place and time and many, many other things. On behalf of myself and certainly on behalf of all the listeners, I want to thank you first of all, for the incredible work that you've been doing now for decades in vision, in taste, and in this bigger issue of how we perceive and experience life. It's truly pioneering and incredible work, and I feel quite lucky to have been on the sidelines seeing this over the years and hearing the talks and reading the countless beautiful papers. But also for your time today to come down here and talk to us about what drives you and the discoveries you've made. Thank you ever so much."
