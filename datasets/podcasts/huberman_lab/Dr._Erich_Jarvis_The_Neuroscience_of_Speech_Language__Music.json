        "text": "I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Eric Jarvis. Doctor Jarvis is a professor at the Rockefeller University in New York City, and his laboratory studies the neurobiology of vocal learning, language, speech disorders, and, remarkably, the relationship between language, music, and movement, in particular, dance. His work spans from genomics, so, the very genes that make up our genome and the genomes of other species that speak and have language, such as songbirds and parrots, all the way up to neural circuits, that is, the connections in the brain and body that govern our ability to learn and generate specific sounds and movements coordinated with those sounds, including hand movements, and all the way up to cognition. That is, our ability to think in specific ways based on what we are saying and the way that we comprehend what other people are saying, singing and doing. As you'll soon see, I was immediately transfixed and absolutely enchanted by Doctor Jarvis's description of his work and the ways that it impacts all the various aspects of our lives. For instance, I learned from Doctor Jarvis that as we read, we are generating very low levels of motor activity in our throat. That is, we are speaking the words that we are reading at a level below the perception of sound or our own perception of those words. But if one were to put an amplifier or to measure the firing of those muscles in our vocal cords, we'd find that as we're reading information, we are actually speaking that information. And as I learned, and you'll soon learn, there's a direct link between those species in the world that have song and movement, which many of us would associate with dance and our ability to learn and generate complex language. So, for people with speech disorders like stutter, or for people who are interested in multiple language learning, bilingual, trilingual, etcetera, and frankly, for anyone who is interested in how we communicate through words, written or spoken, I'm certain today's episode is going to be an especially interesting and important one for you. Doctor Jarvis work is so pioneering that he has been awarded truly countless awards. I'm not going to take our time to list off all the various important awards that he's received, but I should point out that in addition to being a decorated professor at the Rockefeller University, he is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the so called HHMI. And for those of you that don't know HHMI, investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis that they have to re up. That is, they have to recompete every five years. They actually receive a grade every five years. That dictates whether or not they are no longer a Howard Hughes investigator, whether or not they can advance to another five years of funding for their important research. And indeed, Howard Hughes investigators are selected not just for the rigor of their work, but for their pioneering spirit and their ability to take on high risk, high benefit work. Which is exactly the kind of work that Doctor Jarvis has been providing for decades now. Again, I think today's episode is one of the more unique and special episodes that we've had on the Huberman Lab podcast. I single it out because it really spans from the basic to the applied. And Doctor Jarvis story is an especially unique one in terms of how he arrived at becoming a neurobiologist. So, for those of you that are interested in personal journey and personal story, Doctor Jarvis is truly a special and important one. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost and consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything."

Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much."

I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session.

And even as I asked the question, I realized that a lot of people, including myself, probably don't fully appreciate the distinction between speech and language. Speech I think of as the motor patterns, the production of sound that has meaning, hopefully, and language, of course, come various languages and varieties of ways of communicating. But in terms of the study of speech and language, and thinking about how the brain organizes speech and language, what are the similarities? What are the differences? How should we think about speech and language?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, well, I'm glad you invited me here, and I'm also glad to get that first question, which I consider a provocative one. The reason why I've been struggling. What is the difference with speech and language for many years? And realize why am I struggling is because there are behavioral terms, let's call them psychologically, psychology developed kind of terms that don't actually align exactly with brain function. And the question is there a distinction between speech and language? And when I look at the brain of work that other people have done, work we have done, also compared it with animal models like those who can imitate sounds like parrots and songbirds, I start to see there really isn't such a sharp distinction. So to get at what I think is going on, let me tell you how some people think of it now that there's a separate language module in the brain that has all the algorithms and computations that influence the speech pathway on how to produce sound, and the auditory pathway on how to perceive and interpret it for speech or for, you know, sound that we call speech. And it turns out I don't think there is any good evidence for a separate language module. Instead, there is a speech production pathway that's controlling our larynx, controlling our jaw muscles, that has built within it all the complex algorithms for spoken language, and there's the auditory pathway that has built within it all the complex algorithms for understanding speech, not separate from a language module. And this speech production pathway is specialized to humans and parrots and songbirds, whereas this auditory perception pathway is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom. And this is why dogs can understand. Sit, siente, say, come here, boy, get the ball, and so forth. Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words. Great apes, you can teach them for several thousand, but they can't say a word."

        "text": "Fascinating, because you've raised a number of animal species early on here, and because I have basically an obsession with animals since the time I was very small, I have to ask, which animals have language? Which animals have modes of communication that are sort of like language? Yeah, you know, I've heard whale songs. I don't know what they're saying. They sound very beautiful, but they could be insulting each other, for all I know, and they very well. Maybe dolphins, birds. I mean, what do we understand about modes of communication that are like language but might not be what would classically be called language?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Right. So modes of communication that people would define as language more very, in a very narrow definition, they would say production of sounds. So speech and. But what about the hands to gesturing with the hands? What about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the air, communicating information through body language? Well, I'm going to go back to the brain. So what I think is going on is, for spoken language, we're using the speech pathway and all the complex algorithms there. Next to the brain regions that are controlling spoken language are the brain regions for gesturing with the hands. And that hand parallel pathway has also complex algorithms that we can utilize. And some species are more advanced in these circuits, whether it's sound or gesturing with hands. And some are less advanced. Now, we humans and a few others are the most advanced for the speech sounds or the spoken language. But a non human primate can produce gesturing in a more advanced form than they could produce sound. I'm not sure I got that across, clearly, just to say that humans are the most advanced at spoken language, but not necessarily as big a difference at gestural language compared to some other species."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Very clear and very interesting, and immediately prompts the question, have there been brain imaging or other sorts of studies evaluating neural activity in the context of cultures and languages, at least that I associate with a lot of hand movement, like Italian versus, I don't know, maybe you could give us some examples of cultures where language is not associated with as much overt hand movement."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yes. So, as you and I are talking here today, and people who are listening but can't see us, we're actually gesturing with our hands as we talk, without knowing it or doing it unconsciously. And if we were talking on a telephone, I would have one hand here and I would be gesturing with the other hand without even you seeing me. Right. And so why is that? Some have argued, and I would agree, based upon what we've seen, is that there is an evolutionary relationship between the brain pathways that control speech production and gesturing, and the brain regions I mentioned are directly adjacent to each other. And why is that? I think that the brain pathways that control speech evolved out of the brain pathways that control body movement, and that when you talk about Italian, French, English, and so forth, each one of those languages come with a learned set of gestures that you can communicate with. Now, how is that related to other animals? Well, Coco, a gorilla who was raised with humans for 39 years or more, learned how to do gesture communication, learned how to sign language, so to speak. Right. But coco couldn't produce those sounds. Coco could understand them as well, by seeing somebody sign or hearing somebody produce speech, but coco couldn't produce it with her voice. And so what's going on there is that a number of species, not all of them, a number of species, have motor pathways in the brain where you can do learned gesturing, rudimentary language, if you wanted, say, with your limbs, even if it's not as advanced as humans. But they don't have this extra brain pathway for the sound, so they can't gesture with their voice in the way that they gesture with their hands."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I see. One thing that I've wondered about for a very long time is whether or not primitive emotions and primitive sounds are the early substrate of language, and whether or not there's a bridge that we can draw between those in terms of just the basic respiration systems associated with different extreme feelings. Here's the way I'm imagining this might work. When I smell something delicious, I typically inhale more, and I might say, mmm, or something like that. Whereas if I smell something putrid, I typically turn away. I wince, and I will exhale, you know, or so kind of like turn away trying to not ingest those molecules or inhale those molecules. I could imagine that these are the basic dark and light contrasts of the language system. And as I say that, I'm saying that from the orientation of a vision scientist who thinks of all visual images built up in a very basic way of a hierarchical model of the ability to see dark and light. So I could imagine this kind of primitive to more sophisticated pyramid of sound to language. Is this a crazy idea? Do we have any, do we have any evidence this is the way it works?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, it's not a crazy idea. And in fact, you hit upon one of the key distinctions in the field of research that I started out in, which is vocal learning research. So for vocal communication, you have most vertebrate species vocalize, but most of them are producing innate sounds that they're born with. Producing, that is, babies crying, for example, or dogs barking. And only a few species have learned vocal communication, the ability to imitate sounds. And that is what makes spoken language special. When people think of what's special about language, it's the learned vocalizations that is what's rare. And so this distinction between innateness and learned is more of a bigger dichotomy when it comes to vocalizations than for other behaviors in the animal kingdom. And when you go in the brain, you see it there as well. All the things you talked about, the breathing, the grunting and so forth. A lot of that is handled by the brain stem circuits right around the level of your neck and below, like a reflex kind of thing, or even some emotional aspects of your behavior in the hypothalamus and so forth. But for a learned behavior, learning how to speak, learning how to play the piano, teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks is using the forebrain circuits. And what has happened is that there's a lot of forebrain circuits that are controlling learning how to move body parts in these species, but not for the vocalizations, but in humans and in parrots and some other species, somehow we acquired circuits where the forebrain has taken over the brainstem, and now using that brainstem not only to produce the innate behaviors or vocal behaviors, but the learned ones."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "As well, do we have any sense of when modern or sophisticated language evolved? Thinking back to the species that we evolved from and even within homo sapiens, has there been an evolution of language? Has there been a devolution of language?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say. And to be able to answer that question, it does come with the caveat that I think we humans overrate ourselves when it compared to other species. And so it makes even scientists go astray in trying to hypothesize, when you especially don't find fossil evidence of language that easily out there. In terms of what happened in the past, amongst the primates which we humans belong to, we are the only ones that have this advanced vocal learning ability. Now, when you. It was assumed that it was only homo sapiens, then you can go back in time. Now, based upon genomic data, not only of us living humans, but of the fossils that have been found for homo sapiens, of neanderthals, of denisovan individuals, and discover that our ancestor, our human ancestors, supposedly hybridized with these other hominid species. And it was assumed that these other hominid species don't learn how to imitate sounds. I don't know of any species today that's a vocal learner that can have children with a non vocal learning species, I don't see it. It doesn't mean it didn't exist. And when we look at the genetic data from these ancestral hominids, where we can look at genes that are involved in learned vocal communication, they have the same sequence as we humans do for genes that function in speech circuits. I think neanderthals had spoken language. I'm not going to say it's as advanced as what it is in humans, I don't know. But I think it's been there for at least between 500,000 to a million years that our ancestors had this ability, and that we've been coming more and more advanced with it culturally and possibly genetically. But I think it's evolved sometime in the last 500,000 to a million years."

I was weaned in the neuroscience era, where birdsong and the ability of birds to learn their tutor song was, and still is a prominent field subfield of neuroscience. And then, of course, neuroimaging of humans speaking and learning, et cetera. And this notion of a critical period, a time in which languages learned more easily than it is later in life, and the names of the different brain areas were quite different. One opens the textbooks. We hear wernickes and brocas for the humans, and you look at the birds of it, I remember HVc, robust arch. Striatum area. Hx. That's right, et cetera. But for most of our listeners, those names won't mean a whole lot. But in terms of homologies, between areas, in terms of function, what do we know? And how similar or different are the brain areas controlling speech and language in, say, a songbird and a young human child?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. So, going back to the 1950s or even a little earlier, Peter Mahler and others who got involved in neuroethology, the study of neurobiology of behavior in a natural way, they start to find that, behaviorally, there are these species of birds, like songbirds and parrots. And now we also know hummingbirds, just three of them out of the 40 something bird groups out there on the planet, orders that they can imitate sounds like we do. And so that was a similarity. In other words, they had this kind of behavior that's more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us or than chickens have with them. Right. Their closer relatives. And then they discovered even more similarities, these critical periods that if you remove a child, this unfortunately happens, where a child is feral and is not raised with human and goes through their puberty phase of growth, it becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult. So there's this critical period where you learn best. And even later on, when you're in regular society, it's hard to learn. Well, the set birds undergo the same thing. And then it was discovered that if they become deaf, we humans become deaf. Our speech starts to deteriorate without any kind of therapy. If a non human primate, or, you know, or let's say a chicken, becomes deaf, their vocalizations don't deteriorate very little, at least. Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds. So there were all these behavioral parallels that came along with a package, and then people looked into the brain. Fernando Nadava, my former PhD advisor, and began to discover the area x. You talked about the robust nucleus of the archipelium. And these brain pathways were not found in the species who couldn't imitate. So there was a parallel here. And then jumping many years later, I started to dig down into these brain circuits to discover that these brain circuits have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans, even though they're by a different name, like Broca's and laryngeal motor cortex. And most recently, we discovered not only the actual circuitry and the connectivity are similar, but the underlying genes that are expressed in these brain regions in a specialized way, different from the rest of the brain, are also similar between humans and songbirds and parrots. So all the way down to the genes. And now we're finding the specific mutations are also similar. Not always identical, but similar, which indicates remarkable convergence for so called complex behavior in species separated by 300 million years from a common ancestor. And not only that, we are discovering that mutations in these genes that cause speech deficits in humans, like in foxp two, if you put those same mutations or similar type of deficits in these vocal learning birds, you get similar deficits. So convergence of the behavior is associated with similar genetic disorders of the behavior."

And for the listeners, I'm doing air quotes here, a different language, a different bird song, different than their own species song, but never as well as they could learn their own natural, genetically linked song. Yes, genetically linked. Meaning that it would be like me being raised in a different culture and that I would learn the other language, but not as well as I would have learned English.

All right, so which would be kind of the equivalent in the linguistic community of universal grammar. There is something genetically influencing our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally. And so there's this balance between the genetic control of speech or a song in these birds and the learned cultural control. And so, yes, if you were to take. I mean, in this case, we actually tried this at Rockefeller later on, take a zebra finch and raise it with a canary, it would sing a song that was sort of like a hybrid in between. We call it a caninche and vice versa for the canary, because there's something different about their vocal musculature or the circuitry in the brain. And with a zebra finch, even with a closely related species, if you would take a zebra finch, young animal, and in one cage next to it, place its own species, adult male, and in the other cage place a bengalese finch next to it, it would preferably learn the song from its own species neighbor.

I think this was in island culture, maybe in Hawaii, called pidgin, which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages that their parents speak at home and that they themselves speak, and that somehow pidgin, again, not the bird, but a language called pidgin, for reasons I don't know, harbors certain basic elements of all language.

What is going on here is cultural evolution, remarkably, tracks genetic evolution. So if you bring people from two separate populations together that have been in their separate populations evolutionarily, at least for hundreds of generations. So someone speaking Chinese, someone's speaking English, and that child then, is learning from both of them. Yes. That child's going to be able to pick up and merge I phonemes and words together in a way that an adult wouldn't, because why they're experiencing both languages at the same time during their critical period years, in a way that adults would not be able to experience. And so you get a hybrid, and the lowest common denominator is going to be what they share. And so the phonemes that they've retained in each of their languages is what's going to be, I imagine, used the most interesting."

What sorts of things are those genes controlling? I could imagine they were controlling the wiring of connections between brain areas, essentially a map of a circuit, like an engineer would design a circuit for speech and language. Nature designed this for speech and language, but presumably other things, too, like the ability to connect motor patterns within the throat of muscles, within the throat and the control of the tongue.

So, yes, one of the things that differ in the speech pathways of us and these song pathways of birds is some of the connections are fundamentally different than the surrounding circuits, like a direct cortical connection from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex to the motor neurons that control the larynx in humans or the syrinx in birds. And so we actually made a prediction that since some of these connections differ. We're going to find genes that control neuro connectivity and that specialize in that function, that differ. And that's exactly what we found. Genes that control what we call axon guidance and formation connections. And what was interesting, it was sort of in the opposite direction that we expected. That is, some of these genes, actually a number of them, that control neuro connectivity, were turned off in the speech circuit. And it didn't make sense to us at first until we started to realize the function of these genes are to repel connections from forming so repulsive molecules. And so when you turn them off, they allow certain connections to form that normally would have not formed. So by turning it off, you got a gain of function for speech. Other genes that surprised us were genes involved in calcium buffering neuroprotection, like a parvavamin or heat shock protein. So when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on. And we couldn't figure out for a long time why is that the case. And then the idea popped to me one day and said, ah, when I heard the larynx is the fastest firing muscles in the body. All right, in order to vibrate sound and modulate sound in the way we do, you have to control, you have to move those muscles three to four to five times faster than just regular walking or running. When you stick electrodes in the brain, areas that control, learn vocalizations in these birds, and I think in humans as well, those neurons are firing at a higher rate to control these muscles. What is that going to do? You're going to have lots of toxicity in those neurons unless you upregulate molecules that take out the extra load that is needed to control the larynx. And then finally, a third set of genes that are specialized in the speech circuit are involved in neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity meaning allowing the brain circuits to be more flexible so you can learn better. And why is that? I think learning how to produce speech is a more complex learning ability than, say, learning how to walk or learning how to do tricks and jumps and so forth that dogs do."

        "text": "Yeah, it's interesting as you say that, because I realize that many aspects of speech are sort of reflexive. I'm not thinking about each word I'm gonna say. They just sort of roll out of my mouth, hopefully with some forethought. We both know people that seem to speak think less. Fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth than others. Right? A lot of examples out there. And some people are very deliberate in their speech, but nonetheless, that much of speech has to be precise, and some of it less precise in terms of plasticity of speech and the ability to learn multiple languages, but even just one language, what's going on in the critical period? The so called critical period? Why is it that. So my niece speaks Spanish, she's guatemalan, speaks Spanish and English incredibly well. She's 14 years old. I've struggled with Spanish my whole life. My father's bilingual, my mother is not. I've tried to learn Spanish as an adult. It's really challenging. I'm told that had I learned it when I was eight, I would be better off. That's right. Or it would be installed within me. So the first question is, is it easier to learn multiple languages without an accent early in life? And if so, why? And then the second question is, if one can already speak more than one language as a consequence of childhood learning, is it easier to acquire new languages later on?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So the answer to both of those questions is yes. But to explain this, I need to let you know, actually, the entire brain is undergoing a critical period development, not just the speech pathways. And so it's easier to learn how to play a piano, it's easier to learn how to ride a bike for the first time and so forth as a young child than it is later in life. What I mean, easier in terms of when you start from first principles of learning something. So the very first time, if you're going to learn Chinese as a child versus the very first time you learn Chinese as an adult, or learning play piano as a child versus an adulthood. But the speech pathways, or let's say speech behavior, I think, has a stronger critical period change to it than other circuits. And what's going on there in general, why do you need a critical period to make you more stable, to make you more stubborn, so to speak? The reason, I believe, is that the brain is not. Brain can only hold so much information. And if you are undergoing rapid learning to learn, to acquire new knowledge, you also have to dump stuff, put memory or information in the trash, like in a computer. You only have so many gigabases of memory. And so therefore, plus also for survival, you don't want to keep forgetting things. And so the brain is designed, I believe, to undergo this critical period and solidify the circuits with what you learned as a child, and you use that for the rest of your life. And we humans stay even more plastic in our brain functions controlled by a gene called srgap two. We have an extra copy of it. That leaves our speech circuit in other brain regions, in a more immature state throughout life compared to other animals. So we're more immature. We're still juvenile like compared to other animals."

And that's a common finding out there in the literature. There are some that argue against it, but for those that support it, the idea there is you are born with a set of innate sounds you can produce of phonemes. And you narrow that down because not all languages use all of them. And so you narrow down the ones you use to string the phonemes together in words that you learn, and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. And here comes along another language that's using those phonemes or in different combinations you're not used to. And therefore, it's like starting from first principles. But if you already have them in multiple languages that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them in another third or fourth language."

What about modes of speech and language that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning, but for which it departs from structured language? Here's what I mean. Poetry. I think of musicians like there's some Bob Dylan songs that to me I understand the individual words. I like to think there's an emotion associated with it. At least I experienced some sort of emotion. And I have a guess about what he was experiencing. But if I were to just read it linearly, without the music and without him singing it or somebody singing it like him, it wouldn't hold any meaning. So in other words, words that seem to have meaning but not associated with language but somehow tap into an emotionality."

Communication that has more of an emotional feeling content to it, but not with the semantics. And the two can be mixed up, like with singing words that have meaning but also have this effective emotional. You just love the sound of the singer that you're hearing. And initially, psychologists, scientists in general, thought that these were going to be controlled by different brain circuits. And it is the case there are emotional brain centers in the hypothalamus, in the cingulate cortex, and so forth that do give tone to the sounds. But I believe, you know, based upon imaging work and work we see in birds, when, when birds are communicating semantic information in their sounds, which is not too often, but it happens, versus effective communication. Sing because I'm trying to attract the mate my courtship song or defend my territory. It's the same brain circuits, the same speech like or song circuits are being used in different ways."

It also, there's something about the intention and the emotional context in which something's spoken that can heavily shape the way that we interpret what we hear."

Effective communication to say I hate you but meant love, right, does have emotional meaning to it. And so one's more like an object kind of meaning or an abstract kind of meaning. There's several other points here. I think it's important for those listening out there to hear is that when I say also this effective and semantic communication being used by similar brain circuits, it also matters the side of the brain in birds and in humans, there's left right dominance for learned communication, learned sound communication. So the left in us humans is more dominant for speech, but the right has a more balance for singing or processing musical sounds as opposed to processing speech. Both get used for both reasons. And so when people say, your right brain is your artistic brain and your left brain is your thinking brain, this is what they're referring to. And so that's another distinction. The second thing that's useful to know is that all vocal learning species use their learned sounds for this emotional, effective kind of communication. But only a few of them, like humans and some parrots and dolphins, use it for the semantic kind of communication we calling speech. And. And that has led a number of people to hypothesize that the evolution of spoken language, of speech evolved first for singing, for this more like emotional kind of made attraction like the Jennifer Lopez, the Ricky Martin kind of songs and so forth. And then later on, it became used for abstract communication like we're doing now."

So in my family, my mother and father's side, they both went to the high school of music and Art here in New York City. And particularly my mother's family, going back multiple generations, they were singers. And I even did my family genealogy and found out I not only we have some relationships to some well known singers, distant relationships like felonious monk, but going back to the plantations in North Carolina and so forth, my ancestors were singers in the church, for the towns and so forth. And this somehow got passed on multiple generations to my family. And I thought I was going to grow up and be a famous singer, right? And me and my brothers and sister formed a band when we were kids and so forth. But it turned out that I didn't inherit the singing talents of some of my other family members, even though it was okay, but not like my brother, not like my mother or my aunts and my cousin puta Fey, who is now a talented native american singer, that then influenced me to do other things. And I started competing in dance contests. Actually, this is around the time of Saturday Night fever, and as a teenager, and I started winning dance contests. And I thought, oh, I can dance. And I auditioned for the high school of performing Arts, and I got in here in New York City and got into ballet. Dance and got in. Right. And thought, if I learn ballet, I can learn everything else. It was that idea. If you learn something classical, it can teach you for everything else. And I was. Yeah. At Alvin Ailey dance school, Joffrey Belli dance School. And at the end of my senior concert, I had this opportunity to audition for the Alvin Ailey dance company. And I had an opportunity to go to college. And I also fell in love with another passion that my father had, which was science. And so I liked science in high school. And I found an overlap also between the arts and sciences. Both required creativity, hard work, discipline, new discovery. Both weren't boring to me. And the one decision I made at that senior dance concert was when talking to the Alvin Ailey recruiter and thinking about it, I have to make a decision. And I thought something my mother taught me because she was growing up in the 1960s cultural revolution, do something that has a positive impact on society. And I thought, I can do that better as a dancer than a scientist. So now jump. I get into college, undergraduate school. I major in molecular biology and mathematics. I decide I want to be a biologist. Got into graduate school, wanted to study the brain at, you know, at the Rockefeller University. So I went from Hunter College to Rockefeller University. And so now I got to the brain, and I. And why did I choose the brain is because it controls dancing. But I didn't, there wasn't anybody studying dancing, and I wanted to study the brain, something that it does that's really interesting and complex. And I thought, ah, language is what it does. You couldn't study that in mice. You couldn't study in nonhuman primates. But these birds do this wonderful thing that Fernando nottebon was studying at Rockefeller. And so that's what got me into the birds and. And then jumping. Now, 15 years later. Yeah, that's right. Even after I'm into now having my own lab, studying vocal learning in these birds as a model for language in humans, it turns out that Ani Patel and others have discovered that only vocal learning species can learn how to dance."

And so when that was discovered in 2009, at that same time in my lab at Duke, we discovered that vocal learning brain pathways in songbirds as well as in humans and parrots. Right. Like snowball are embedded within circuits that control learning how to move. And that led us to a theory called the brain pathway, or motor theory of vocal learning origin, where the brain pathways for vocal learning and speech evolved by a whole duplication of the surrounding motor circuits involving learning how to move. Now, how does that explain dance? Right. Well, when snowball, the cockatoos are dancing, they're using the brain regions around their speech like circuits to do this dancing behavior. And so what's going on there, what we hypothesize and now like to test is that when this, when speech evolves in humans and the equivalent behavior in parrots and songbirds, it required a very tight integration in the brain regions that can hear sound, with the brain regions that control your muscles from moving your larynx and tongue and so forth, for producing sound. And that tight auditory motor integration, we argue, then, contaminated the surrounding brain regions. And that contamination of the surrounding brain regions now allows us, humans in particular and parrots, to coordinate our muscle movements of the rest of the body with sound in the same way we do for speech sounds. So we're speaking with our bodies when we dance."

You said something incredible that I completely believe, even though I have minimum to, let's just say minimum dancing ability. Okay. I can get by at a party or wedding without complete embarrassment, but I don't have any structured training, so the body clearly can communicate with movement. As a trained dancer and knowing other trained dancers, I always think of dance and bodily movement and communication through bodily movement as a form of wordlessness, like a state of wordlessness. In fact, the few times when I think that maybe I'm actually dancing modestly, well for the context that I'm in, where I see other people dancing and they seem to just be very much in the movement, it's almost like a state of non spoken language. And yet what you're telling me is that there's a direct bridge at some level between the movement of the body and language. So is there a language of the body that is distinct from the language of speech. And if so, or if not, how do those map onto one another? What does that Venn diagram look like?"

And the vocal learning species specialize in doing is synchronizing body movements of muscles to the rhythmic beat of music. And for some reason, we like doing that. We like synchronizing to sound and doing it together as a group of people. And that kind of communication amongst ourselves is more like the effective kind of communication I mentioned earlier, unlike the semantic kind. So we humans are using our voices more for the semantic, abstract communication, but we're using learn dance for the effective emotional bonding kind of communication. It doesn't mean we can't communicate semantic information in dance, and we do it, but it's not as popular like a ballet that in the nutcracker, it is popular where they are communicating. The arabian guy comes out, which I was the arabian guy in the ballet nutcracker. That's how I remember for the Westchester Ballet company when I was a teenager. We're trying to communicate meaning, and now ballet, dance, and it can go on with a whole story and so forth, but people don't interpret that as clearly as speech. They're seeing the ballet with semantic communication, with a lot of emotional content. Whereas you go out to a club. Yeah, you're not communicating. Okay, how you feeling today? Tell me about your day and so forth, you're trying to synchronize with other people in an effective way.

And there was one lab where they were putting eeg electrodes on the dancers, on two different dancers partnering with each other, as well as the audience seeing the dance. And some argued, okay, if you're listening to the music as well, how are you responding? Because you're asking a question about music, and I'm giving you an answer about dance.

But this discovery, maybe dancing even more so in terms of a talented, the genetic component, if it really exists. I don't know. You know, with my 23 andme results, you know, it says I have the genetic substitutions that are associated with, you know, high intensity athletes and fast twist muscles. And who knows? Maybe that could have something to do with me being able to synchronize my body to rhythmic sounds, maybe, maybe better than some others. It turns out that my genetics also show that I have a genetic substitute that doesn't, that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch. And so that does correlate with my, you know, even though I can sing on this pitch, especially if I hear a piano or, you know, kind of playing it. But, you know, maybe that's why my siblings, you know, who didn't have that genetic predisposition in his 23 me results can go along with the genetic component as well."

But there are, of course, you know, thousands, if not millions of micro expressions and things of that sort, many of which are subconscious. And we're. We are all familiar with the fact that when what somebody says doesn't match some specific feature of their facial expression that it can, um, call, you know, that mismatch can cue our attention, especially among people that know each other very well. Like, somebody will say, well, you said that, but your right eye twitched a little bit in a way that tells me that you didn't really mean that these kinds of things, or when, in the opposite example, when the emotionality and the content of our speech is matched to a facial expression, there's something that's just so wonderful about that, because it seems like everything's aligned."

And now we both share some students that were co mentoring and talk about this same question that you brought up. And what I'm learning a lot is that non human primates have a lot of diversity in their facial expression like we humans do. And what we know about the neurobiology of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face is that these non human primates and some other species that don't learn how to imitate vocalizations, they have strong connections from the cortical regions to the motor neurons that control facial expressions, but absent connections or weak connections to the motor neurons that control the voice. So I think our diverse facial expression, even though it's more diverse than these nonhuman primates, there was already a pre existing diversity of communication, whether it's intentional or unconscious, through facial expression in our ancestors. And on top of that, we humans now add the voice along with those facial expressions."

So at some point, everybody learns, for better or for worse, how to untangle these different components of hand movement, body posture, speech, and facial expression. But in their best form, I would say assuming that the best form is always. I guess there are instances where, for safety reasons, one might need to feign some of these aspects of language. But in most cases, when those are aligned, it seems like that could reflect that all the different circuitries are operating in parallel, but that the ability to misalign these is also a powerful aspect to our maturation. I even think of theater, for instance, where deliberate disentangling of these areas is important. But also, we know when an actor, when it feels real and when it looks like, when bad acting is, oftentimes when the facial expression or body posture just doesn't quite match what we're hearing. So are these skills that people that learn and acquire according to adaptability and profession? Or do you think that all children and all adults eventually learn how to couple and uncouple these circuits a little bit."

And by the way, when I say we humans have facial expressions associated with our vocalizations in a different way than primates, non human primates, it's the learned vocalizations I'm talking about. So there is a common view out there that facial expressions in non human species, like non human primates, or you can have them in birds too, are innate. And so they're reflexive, controlled. I don't believe that. I think there's some learned component to it and I think we have more learning component to it as well. But we also have an innate component. And so if you try to put your hands behind your back and hold your fist, or even just not and try to speak and try to communicate, it's actually harder to do. You have to force yourself or put it by your side. This comes naturally. Facial expressions comes naturally because there's an innate component. And yes, you have to learn how to dissociate the two communicate something angry with your hands or with your face, but, you know, politely with your voice. It's very hard to distinct, to separate at those two because there is that innate component that brings them together. So it's like an email too. You're emailing and someone says something by email, someone can interpret that angrily or gently, and it becomes ambiguous. The facial expressions get rid of that ambiguity."

Yeah, he sends his react, told me that his practice for writing and for thinking involves a quite painful process of forcing himself to sit completely still and think in complete sentences. To force thinking in complete sentences. And when he told me that, I decided to try this exercise and it's quite difficult. First of all, it's difficult for the reason that you mentioned, which is that with many thoughts, I want to look around and I start to gesticulate with my hands. So there it is again. The connection between language and hand movement, even if one isn't speaking. And the other part is that's challenging, is I realize that while we write incomplete sentences, most of the time, we'll talk about how that's changing now and texting, et cetera, that we don't often think in complete sentences, and specifically in simple declarative sentences, that a lot of our thoughts would be, if they were written out onto a page, would look pretty much like passive language, that a good copy editor, or a good editor would say, oh, we need to cross this out, make this simple and declarative. So what I'm getting at here is, what is the process of going from a thought to language to written word? And I also wanted to touch on handwritten versus typed, but thought to language to written word. What's going on there? What do we know about the neural circuitry?

And coming from the linguistic world, and even just the regular neurobiology world, going back to something I said before, is about a separate language module in the brain. There was this thought or hypothesis that this language module has all these complex algorithms to them, and they're signaling to the speech circuit, how to produce the sounds, the hand circuit, how to write them or gesture, the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading, and the auditory pathway for listening. I don't think that's the case. And that this thinking where there's this internal speech going on, what I think is going on is to explain what you're asking is about. I'm going to take it from the perspective of reading something. You read something on a paper. The signal from the paper goes through your eyes, it goes to the back of your brain, to your visual cortical regions, eventually. And then you now got to interpret that signal in your visual pathway of what you're reading. How are you going to do that in terms of speech? That visual signal then goes to your speech pathway in the motor cortex in front here in Broca's area, and you silently speak what you read in your brain without moving your muscles. Sometimes, actually, if you put electrodes, EEG, EMG electrodes, on your laryngeal muscles, even on birds, you can do this. You'll see activity there while reading or trying to speak silently, even though no sound's coming out. And so your speech pathway is now speaking what you're reading. Now, to finish it off, that signal is sent to your auditory pathway so you can hear what you're speaking in your own head."

Now, the hand areas next to your speech pathway has got to take that auditory signal, or even the adjacent motor signals, for speaking, and translate it into a visual signal on paper.

It allows me to slow down a bit, you know, breathe and inhale some oxygen and so on, because I tend to speak quickly if I'm not writing something out.

I can touch type. Now, I don't think I ever taught my. I think I taught myself. I never took a touch type course, but just sort of happened. Now, my motor system seems to know where the keys are with enough, enough accuracy that it works. This is remarkable to me that any of us can do this, but when it comes to writing, what I've found is that if my rate of thought and my rate of writing are aligned nicely, things go well. However, if I'm thinking much faster than I can write, that's a problem, and certainly if I'm thinking more slowly than I want to write, that's also a problem. And the solution for me has been to write with a pen. I'm in love with these, and I have no relationship to the company, at least not now, although if they want to come, you know, if they want to work with us. I love these pilot v five, v seven s because, not necessarily because of the ink or the feel, although I like that as well, but because of the rate that allows me to write. They write very well slowly, and they write very well quickly. And so I have this theory, supported only by my own anecdata, no peer reviewed study, that writing by hand is fundamentally different than typing out information.

So you have to coordinate your fingers more in opposite directions and so forth with typing. But also writing by hand requires more arm movement. And so, therefore, I would argue that the difficulty there could be in the types of muscles and the fine motor control you need of those muscles, along with speaking in your brain at the same time."

And I think it takes a longer time for us to write words with our fingers, because in terms of the speech.

We also have the assumption that if somebody's stuttering, that their thinking is slow. But it turns out there are many examples historically of people who could not speak well, but who were brilliant thinkers. I don't know how well they could write, but they found other modes of communication.

The first study we had, Washington, a brain area called the basal ganglia, or the striatum, part of the basal ganglia involved in coordinating movements, learning how to make movements when it was damaged in a speech like pathway in these birds. What we found is that they started to stutter as the brain region recovered. And unlike humans, they actually recovered after three or four months. And why is that the case? Because birdbrains undergoes new neurogenesis in a way that human or mammal brains don't. And it was the new neurons that were coming in into the circuit, but not quite with the right proper activity, was resulting in this stuttering in these birds. And after it was repaired, not exactly. The old song came back after the repair, but still, it recovered a lot better. And it's now known they call this neurogeneics, stuttering in humans with damage to the basal ganglia, or some type of disruption to the basal ganglia at a young age also causes stuttering in humans and even those who are born with stuttering.

And is going to finish it off because it's already going through their brain and they can predict it. That would be one theory. I don't think the verdict out there is known, but that's one. The other is synchronizing, turn taking in the conversation where you're acknowledging that we understand each other by finishing off what I say. And it's almost like a social bonding kind of thing. The other could be, I want the person to shut up so I can speak as well and take that turn. And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation.

Texting is a very, very interesting evolution of language, because what you've told us is that we have a thought. It's translated into language. It might not be complete sentences, but texting. I have to imagine this is the first time in human evolution where we've written with our thumbs. So I don't, you know, it seems more primitive to me than typing with fingers around your hands. But, hey, who am I to judge evolution of our species in one direction or the other? But the shorthand, often grammatically deficient, incomplete sentence form of texting is an incredible thing to see. Early in relationships, romantic relationships, people will often evaluate the other's text and their ability to use proper grammar and spelling, et cetera. This often quickly degrades. And there's an acceptance that we're just trying to communicate through shorthand, almost military like shorthand, but with internally consistent between people. But there's no general consensus of what things mean. But, you know, wtfs and like omgs and all sorts of things, I wonder sometimes whether or not we are getting less proficient at speech because we are not required to write and think in complete sentences. I'm not being judgmental here. I see this in my colleagues. I see this in myself. This is not a judgment of the younger generation. I also know that slang has existed for decades, if not hundreds of years. But I also know that I don't speak the same way that I did when I was a teenager because I've suppressed a lot of that slang, not because it's inappropriate or offensive, although some of it was, frankly, but because it's out of context. So what do you think's happening to language? Are we getting better at speaking, worse at speaking?

But if I really think about it, clearly, texting actually has allowed for more rapid communication amongst people. I think without the invention of the phone before then, or texting back and forth, you had to wait days for a letter to show up. You couldn't call somebody on the phone and talk as well. And so this rapid communication, in terms of the rapid communication of writing in this case. So I think actually it's more like a use it or lose it kind of thing with the brain. The more you use a particular brain region or circuit, the more enhanced it's like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the more healthier it is, the bigger it becomes and the more space it takes and the more you lose something else. So I think texting is nothing decreasing the speech prowess or the intellectual prowess of speech. It's converting it and using it a lot in a different way, in a way that may not be as rich in regular writing because you can only communicate so much nuance in short term writing.

That brings me to what was going to be the next question anyway, which is we are quickly moving toward a time where there will be an even faster transition from thought to speech to motor output and maybe won't require motor output. What I'm referring to here is some of the incredible work of our colleagues, Eddie Chang at UCSF and others who are taking paralyzed human beings and learning to translate the electrical signals of neurons in various areas, including speech and language areas, to computer screens that type out what these people are thinking. In other words, paralyzed people can put their thoughts on into writing. That's a pretty extreme and wonderful example of recovery of function that is sure to continue to evolve. But I think we are headed toward a time not too long from now where I. My thoughts can be translated into words on a page if I allow that to happen."

So, and Eddie Chang's work, which I admire quite a bit in cite in my papers, I think he's really one of those at the leading edge of trying to understand within humans the neurobiology of speech. And he may not say it directly, but I talked to him about this. It supports this idea that the speech circuit in a separate language module. I don't really think that there's a separation there. So with that knowledge. Yes. And putting electrodes in the human brain and then translating those electrical signals to speech currents. Yeah. We can start to tell what is that person thinking? Why? Because we often think in terms of speech without saying words. And that's a scary thought. And now imagine if you can now translate those into a signal that transmits something wirelessly and someone from some distant part of the planet is hearing your speech from a wireless signal without you speaking. So probably that won't be done in an ethical way. Who knows? But I mean, the ethics of doing that probably might not happen. But who knows? We have these songbirds, you know, we apply the same technique to them. We can start to hear what they're singing in their dreams or whatever, even though they don't produce sound. So we can find out by testing."

Are there any tools that you recommend? And here again, I realize you're not a speech therapist, but here I'm nothing thinking about ameliorating any kind of speech deficiency. I'm thinking, for instance, do you recommend that people read different types of writing? Would you recommend that people learn how to dance in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally? And feel free to have some degrees of freedom in this answer. These are obviously not peer reviewed studies that we're referring to, although there may be. But I'm struck by the number of things that you do exceedingly well. And I can't help but ask, well, that the singing, which I realize it may, your brother didn't pay me to say, this, may not be quite as good as your brothers yet, but you'll surpass him, I'm guessing, at some point. Exactly. There you go. Should kids learn how to dance and read hard books and simple books? What do you recommend? Should adults learn how to do that? Everyone wants to know how to keep their brain working better, so to speak. But also, I think people want to be able to speak well, and people want to be able to understand well."

        "text": "Yeah. So what I've discovered personally, right, is that. So when I switch from pursuing a career in science, from a career in dance, I thought one day I would stop dancing, but I haven't because I find it fulfilling for me, just as a life experience. So, ever since I started college, my late teens and early twenties, I kept dancing, even till this day. There have been periods of time, like during the pandemic, where I slowed down on dancing and so forth. And when you do that, you realize, okay, there are parts of your body where your muscle tone decreases a little bit somewhat, or you could start to gain weight, or I somehow don't gain weight that easily, and I think it's related to my dance, if that's meaningful to your audience. But what I found is, in science, we like to think of a separation between movement and action and cognition. And there is a separation between perception and production. Cognition being perception, production being moving, right? But if the speech pathways is next to the movement pathways, what I discover is by dancing, it is helping me think. It is helping keeping my brain fresh. It's not just moving my muscles, I'm moving or using the circuitry in my brain to control a whole big body. You need a lot of brain tissue to do that. And so I argue, if you want to stay cognitively intact into your old age, you better be moving and you better be doing it consistently. Whether it's dancing, walking, running, and also practicing speech, oratory, speech and so forth, or singing is controlling the brain circuits that are moving your facial musculature, and it's going to keep your cognitive circuits also in tune. And I'm convinced of that from my own personal experience."

I definitely want to get the opportunity to talk about some of the newer work that you're into right now about genomes of animals. As you perhaps can tell from my quite authentic facial expressions, I adore the animal kingdom. I just find it amazing. And it's the reason I went into neurobiology, in part. So many animals, so many different patterns of movement, so many body plans, so many specializations. What is the value of learning the genomes of all these animals? I can think of conservation based schemes, of trying to preserve these precious critters. But what are you doing with the genomes of these animals? What do you want to understand about their brain circuits? And how does this relate to some of the discussion we've been having up until."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I've gotten very heavily involved in genomes, not just to get at an individual gene involved in the trait of interest, like spoken language, but I realized that nature has done natural experiments for us. But all these species out there with these various traits, and the one that I'm studying, like vocal learning, has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom. Even if it's rare, it's multiple times. And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species, but to find out what those genetic changes that are associated with the trait of interest and not some other trait, like flying in birds as opposed to singing. You have to do what's called comparative genomics, even in the context of studying the brain. And you need their genomes to compare the genomes and do like a gwas, a genome wide association study, not just within a species like humans, but across species. And so you need good genomes to do that. Plus, I've discovered I'm also interested in evolution and origins. How did these species come about a similar trait in last 300 million years, or 60 million years, depending who you're talking about. And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that. And to get a good phylogenetic tree, you also need their genomes. And so because of this, I got involved in large scale consortiums to produce genomes of many different species, including my vocal learners and their closest relatives that I'm fans of. But I couldn't convince the funding agencies to give me the money to do that just for my own project. When you get a whole bunch of people together who want to study various traits, you know, heart disease or what, or loss and gain of flight and so forth, suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this. And so now that got me into a project to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes project, to eventually sequence all 70,000 species on the planet. And IRF biogenome project, all eukaryotic species, all 2 million of them, and to no longer be in a situation where I wish I had this genome. Now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet, create a database of all their traits, and find the genetic association with everything out there that makes a difference from one species to another. One more piece of the equation to add to this story is what I didn't realize as a neuroscientist were that these genomes are not only incomplete, but they have lots of errors in them. False gene duplications, where mother and father chromosomes were so different from each other that the genome algorithm, assembly algorithms, treated them as two different genes in this part of the chromosome. So there are a lot of these false, duplicated genes that people were thought were real, but were not, or missing parts of the genome, because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA couldnt get through this regulatory region that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence. I ended up in these consortiums, pulling in the genome sequencing companies, developing the technology to work with us to improve it further. Computer science guys who then take that data and that technology and try to make the complete genomes and make the algorithms better to produce what we now just did recently, and led by an effort by Adam Philippi, is the first human telomere to telomere genome with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence. And now we're trying to do the same thing with vertebrates and other species. Actually, we improved that even before we got to the, what we call telomere to telomere from one end of the chromosome to another. And what we're discovering is in this dark matter of the genome that was missing before, turns out to be some regulatory regions that are specialized in vocal learning species and we think are involved in developing speech circuits."

        "text": "Incredible. Well, so much to learn and that we're going to learn from this information early on in these genome projects and connectome projects. I confess I was a little bit cynical. This would be about 1015 years ago. I thought, okay, necessary, but not sufficient for anything. We need it, but it's not clear what's going to happen, but you just gave a very clear example of what we stand to learn from this kind of information. And I know from the conservation side, there's a huge interest in this, because even though we would prefer to keep all these species alive rather than clone them, these sorts of projects do offer the possibility of potentially recreating species that were lost due to our own ignorance or missteps or what have you."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yes. And along those lines, because we got involved in genomics, some of the first species that we start working on are critically endangered species. And I'm doing that not only for perspectives to understand their brains and the genes involved in their brain function, I feel like it's a moral duty. So the fact that now I become more involved in genome biology and have helped develop these tools for more complete genomes, let's capture their genetic code now before they're gone. And could we use that information to resurrect the species at some future time? If not in my lifetime, in the future, in generations ahead of us. And so in anticipation of that, we create a database we call the genome arc, no pun intended, like Noah's ark, meant to store the genetic code as complete genome assemblies as possible for all species on the planet, to be used for basic science, but also some point in the future. And because of that, funding agencies or private foundations that are interested in conservation have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist, to help them out in producing high quality genome data of endangered species that they can use, like revive and restore, who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon, or colossal, who wants to resurrect the woolly mammoth. And so we're producing high quality genomes for these groups, for their conservation projects."

And I think for those listening today, they now certainly understand the value of deeply understanding the brain structures and genomes of different species. Because, I confess, even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature, and I certainly understand that humans have speech and language, I had no idea that there was so much convergence of function, structure and genomes. And to me, I feel a lot more like an ape than I do a songbird. And yet here we are with the understanding that there's a lot more similarity between songbirds and humans than I certainly ever thought before."

We use it also for good things to let in more light or let out less light, depending on the part of the planet our population evolved in. And most people think dark skinned people all evolved from the same dark skinned person, and light skinned people all evolved from the same light skinned person. But that's not the case. Dark skin and light skin amongst humans has evolved independently multiple times, like in the pacific islands versus Africa. And it's just depending on the angle of light hitting the earth as to whether you need more protection from the sun or less protection, that's also associated with vitamin d synthesis in the skin. And each time where darker or lighter skin evolved independently, it hit the same gene, the melatonin, melanin. Melanin receptors. That's right. Yes. Genes that are involved in melanin formation. And so those genes evolve some of the same mutations even in different species. It's not just humans. In equatorial regions, there are darker skinned animals than going away from the equator."
