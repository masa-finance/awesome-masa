        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Mark Andreessen. Mark Andreessen is a software engineer and an investor in technology companies. He co founded and developed Mosaic, which was one of the first widely used web browsers. He also co founded and developed Netscape, which was one of the earliest widespread used web browsers. And he co founded and is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most successful Silicon Valley venture capital firms. All of that is to say that Mark Andreessen is one of the most successful innovators and investors ever. I was extremely excited to record this episode with Mark for several reasons. First of all, he himself is an incredible innovator. Second of all, he has an uncanny ability to spot the innovators of the future. And third, Mark has shown over and over again the ability to understand how technologies not yet even developed are going to impact the way that humans interact at large. Our conversation starts off by discussing what makes for an exceptional innovator, as well as what sorts of environmental conditions make for exceptional innovation and creativity more generally. In that context, we talk about risk taking, not just in terms of risk taking in one's profession, but about how some people, not all, but how some people who are risk takers and innovators in the context of their work also seem to take a lot of risks in their personal life and some of the consequences that can bring. Then we discuss some of the most transformative technologies that are now emerging, such as novel approaches to developing clean energy, as well as AI or artificial intelligence. With respect to AI, Mark shares his views as to why AI is likely to greatly improve human experience, and we discussed the multiple roles that AI is very likely to have in all of our lives in the near future. Mark explains how not too long from now, all of us are very likely to have AI assistance, for instance, assistants that give us highly informed health advice, highly informed psychological advice. Indeed, it is very likely that all of us will soon have AI assistance that govern most, if not all, of our daily decisions. And Mark explains how, if done correctly, this can be a tremendously positive addition to our life. In doing so, Mark provides a stark counterargument for those that argue that AI is going to diminish human experience. So if you're hearing about and or concerned about the ways that AI is likely to destroy us today, you are going to hear about the many different ways that AI technologies now in development are likely to enhance our human experience at every level. What you'll soon find is that while today's discussion does center around technology and technology development, it is really a discussion about human beings and human psychology. So whether you have an interest in technology development and or AI, I'm certain that you'll find today's discussion to be an important and highly lucid view into what will soon be the future that we all live in. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com huberman Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, NiDRA sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the Waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations. And there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep, deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with Mark Andreessen. Mark, welcome."

        "text": "Delighted to have you here and have so many questions for you about innovation AI, your view of the landscape of tech and humanity in general. I want to start off by talking about innovation from three different perspectives. There's the inner game, so to speak, or the psychology of the innovator, or innovators, things like their propensity for engaging in conflict or not, their propensity for having a dream or a vision, and in particular, their innovation as it relates to some psychological trait or expression. So we'll get to that in a moment. The second component that I'm curious about is the outer landscape around innovators, who they place themselves with, the sorts of choices that they make and also the sorts of personal relationships that they might have or not have. And then the last component is this notion of the larger landscape that they happen to find themselves in. What time in history? What's the geography? Bay Area, New York, Dubai, et cetera. So, to start off, is there a common trait of innovators that you think is absolutely essential as a seed to creating things that are really impactful?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So I'm not a psychologist, but I've picked up some of the concepts, some of the, some of the terms. And so it was a great moment of delight in my life when I learned about the big five personality traits, because I was like, aha. There's a way to actually describe the answer to this question in at least reasonably scientific terms. And so I think what you're looking for, when you're talking about real innovators, like people who actually do really creative breakthrough work, I think you're talking about a couple things. So one is very high in what's called trait openness, which is one of the big five, which is basically just like flat out open and new ideas. And of course, the nature of trade openness is trade openness means you're not just open to new ideas in one category. You're open to many different kinds of new ideas. And so we might talk about the fact that a lot of innovators also are very creative people in other aspects of their lives, even outside of their specific creative domain. So that's important. But of course, just being open is not sufficient, because if you're just open, you could just be curious and explore and spend your entire life reading and doing, talking to people and never actually create something. So you also need a couple other things. You need a high level of conscientiousness, which is another one of the big five. You need somebody who's really willing to apply themselves. And in our world, typically over a period of many years to be able to accomplish something right. They typically work very hard. That often gets obscured because the stories that end up getting told about these people are, it's just like, there's this kid, and he just had this idea, and it was like a stroke of genius. And it was like a moment in time. And I was just like, oh, he was so lucky. And it's like, no, for most of these people, it's years and years and years of applied effort. And so you need somebody with an extreme basic willingness to defer gratification and really apply themselves to a specific thing for a long time. And of course, this is why there aren't very many of these people, is there aren't many people who are high in openness and high in conscientiousness because to a certain extent, they're opposed traits. And so you need somebody who has both of those. Third is you need somebody high in disagreeableness, which is the third of the big five. So you need somebody who's just like, basically ornery, right? Because if they're not ornery, then they'll be talked out of their ideas by people who will be like, oh, well, because the reaction, most people have new ideas is, oh, that's dumb. And so somebody who's too agreeable will be easily dissuaded to not pursue, not pulling the thread anymore. So you need somebody highly disagreeable. Again, the nature of disagreeableness is they tend to be disagreeable, disagreeable about everything, right? So they tend to be these very sort of iconoclastic, you know, kind of renegade characters. And then there's just a table stakes component, which is they just also need to be high iq. They just need to be really smart because it's just, it's hard to innovate in any category if you can't synthesize large amounts of information quickly. And so those are four, like, basically like high spikes, you know, very rare traits that basically have to have to come together. You could probably also say they probably at some point need to be relatively low in neuroticism, which is another the big five, because if they're too neurotic, they probably can't handle the stress. So it's kind of this dial in there. And then, of course, if you're into the sort of science of the big five, basically these are all people who are on the far outlying kind of point on the normal distribution across all these traits. And then that just gets you to, I think, the sort of hardest topic of all around this whole concept, which is just there are very few of these people."

        "text": "Do you think they're born with these traits?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. Well, so they're born with the traits. And then, of course, the traits are not genetics, are not destiny, and so the traits are not deterministic in the sense of that just because they have those personality traits doesn't mean they're going to deliver great creativity, but they need to have those properties because otherwise they're just not either going to be able to do the work or they're not going to enjoy it. I mean, look, a lot of these people are highly capable, competent people. It's very easy for them to get high paying jobs in traditional institutions and get lots of traditional awards and end up with big paychecks. And, you know, there's a lot of people at, you know, big institutions that we know, you and I know well. And I deal with many of these where people get paid a lot of money and they get a lot of respect and they go for 20 years and it's great and they never create anything new. Right. And so there's, there's a lot of administrators and a lot of them, yeah, a lot of them end up in administrative jobs. And that's fine. That's good. The world needs, you know, the world needs that also. Right. The innovators can't run everything because everything, you know, the rate of change would be too high. Society, I think, probably wouldn't be able to handle it. So you need some people who are on the other side who are going to kind of keep the lights on and keep things running. But there is this decision that people have to make, which is okay if I have the sort of latent capability to do this. Is this actually what I want to spend my life doing? And do I want to go through the stress and the pain and the trauma and the anxiety and the risk of failure? Do I really want to? Once in a while, you run into somebody who just can't do it any other way. They just have to."

        "text": "Elon's the paramount example of our time. And I bring him up in part because he's such an obvious example, but in part because he's talked about this in interviews, wherever, he basically says, like, he's like, I can't turn it off. Like, the ideas come, I have to pursue them. Right. It's why he's like running five companies at the same time and, like, working on a 6th. Right. It's just like he can't turn it off. You know, look, there's a lot of other people who probably have the capability to do it who ended up talking themselves into or, you know, whatever events conspired to put them in a position where they did something else. You know, obviously there are people who try to be creative who just don't have the capability. And so there's some Venn diagram there of determinism through traits, but also choices in life. And then also, of course, the situation in which they're born, the context within which they grow up, culture, what their parents expect of them and so forth. And so you have to kind of get all the way through this. You have to thread all these needles kind of at the same time."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Do you think there are folks out there that meet these criteria who are disagreeable, but that can feign agreeableness for those just listening? Mark just raised his right hand. In other words, they can sort of the phrase that comes to mind maybe because I can relate to a little bit, they sneak up through the system, meaning they behave ethically as it relates to the requirements of the system. They're not breaking laws or breaking rules. In fact, quite the opposite. They're paying attention to the rules and following the rules until they get to a place where being disagreeable feels less threatening to their overall sense of security."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, look, the really highly competent people don't have to break laws, right? Like, it's the, there was this, there was this, there was this myth, you know, that sort of happened around the movie the Godfather. And then there was this character, Meyer Lansky, you know, who's, like, ran basically the Mafia, you know, 50, 60, 70 years ago. And there was this great line of like, well, if Meyer Lansky had only, like, applied himself to running General Motors, he would have been the best CEO of all time. It's like, no, not really. Right? Like, the people who are, like, greater running the big companies, they don't have to, they don't have to be mob bosses. They don't have to, like, break laws. They can, you know, they can, they can do. They can work. They're smart and sophisticated enough to be able to work inside the system. You know, they don't need to take the easy out. So I don't think there's any implication that they have to, you know, that they have to break laws. That said, they have to break norms, right? And specifically, the thing, this is probably the thing that gets missed the most, because the process of innovating, the process of creating something new, once it works, the stories get retconned, as they say in comic books. So the stories get adapted to where it's like it was inevitable all along. Everybody always knew that this was a good idea. The person has won all these awards. Society embraced them. And invariably, if you were with them when they were actually doing the work, or if you actually get a couple drinks into them and talk about it, it'd be like, no, that's not how it happened at all. They faced a wall of skepticism, just like a wall of basically social, essentially denial. No, this is not going to work. No, I'm not going to join your lab. No, I'm not going to come work for your company. No, I'm not going to buy your product. No, I'm not going to meet with you. They get just tremendous social resistance. They're not getting positive feedback from their social network the way that more agreeable people need to have. This is why agreeableness is a problem for innovation. If you're agreeable, you're going to listen to the people around you. They're going to tell you that new ideas are stupid. End of story. You're not going to proceed. And so I would put it more on like, they need to be able to deal with. They need to be able to deal with social discomfort to the level of ostracism, or at some point they're going to get shaken out and they're just going to quit."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Do you think that people that meet these criteria do best by banding with others that meet these criteria early? Or is it important that they form this deep sense of self, the ability to cry oneself, to sleep at night or lie in the fetal position, worrying that things aren't going to work out and then still get up the next morning and get right back out there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right? So Sean Parker has the best line, by the way, on this. He says being an entrepreneur, being a creator, is like getting punched in the face over and over again. He said eventually you start to like the taste of your own blood. And I love that line because it makes everybody, like, massively uncomfortable. Right. But it gives you a sense of, like, how basically painful the process is. If you talk to any entrepreneur who's been through it about that, they're like, oh, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what it's like. So there is a big individual component to it. But look, it can be very lonely and especially very hard, I think, to do this if nobody around you is trying to do anything even remotely similar. And if you're getting just universally negative responses like very few people, I think very few people have the ego strength to be able to survive that for years. So I do think there's a huge advantage, and that's why you do see clusters. There's a huge advantage to clustering, right? And so you have, and, you know, throughout history, you've had this clustering effect, right? You had, you know, clustering of the great artists and sculptors and renaissance florists. You know, you have the clustering of the philosophers of Greece, you have the clustering of tech people in Silicon Valley. You have the clustering of creative arts, movie, tv, people in Los Angeles and so forth and so on. There's always a scene, right? There's always like a nexus and a place where people come together for these kinds of things. So, generally speaking, if somebody wants to work in tech, innovate in tech, they're going to be much better off being around a lot of people who are trying to do that kind of thing than they are in a place where nobody else is doing it. Having said that, the clustering has, it can have downsides, it can have side effects. And you put any group of people together and you do start to get groupthink, even among people who are individually very disagreeable. And so these same clusters where you get these very idiosyncratic people, they do have fads and trends just like every place else. Right. And so they get wrapped up in their own social dynamics. The good news is the social dynamic in those places is usually very forward looking. And so it's usually like, you know, it's. I don't know. It's like a herd of iconoclasts looking for the next big thing. Right. So iconoclasts looking for the next big thing. That's good. The herd part. Right. That's what you got to be careful of. So even when you're in one of these environments, you have to be careful that you're not getting sucked into the groupthink too much."

        "text": "When you say groupthink, do you mean excessive friction due to pressure testing each other's ideas to the point where things just don't move forward? Or are you talking about group think, where people start to form a consensus, or the self belief that, gosh, we are so strong because we are so different? What do you. Can we better define groupthink?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It's actually less. Either one of those things both happen, and those are good. Those are good. The part of group think I'm talking about is just like, we all basically zero in. We just end up zeroing in on the same ideas. In Hollywood, there's this classic thing. There are years where all of a sudden there's a lot of volcano movies. It's like, why are there all these volcano movies? And it's just like, there was just something in that stall, right? There was just something in the air. Silicon Valley has this. There are moments in time where you'll have these. It's like the old thing. What's the difference between a fad and a trend? Fad is the trend that doesn't last. Silicon Valley is subject to both fads and trends just like anyplace else. In other words, you take smart, disagreeable people, you cluster them together. They will act like a herd. They will end up thinking the same things unless they try very hard not to."

So you can recognize these traits. Here. I'm making the presumption that you have these traits. Indeed you do. We'll just get that out of the way. Have you observed people trying to feign these traits? And are there any specific questions or behaviors that are a giveaway that they're pretending to be the young Steve Jobs or that they're pretending to be the young Henry Ford? Pick your list of other names that qualify as authentic, legitimate innovators. We won't name names of people who've tried to disguise themselves as true innovators, but what are some of the litmus tests? I realize here that we don't want you to give these away to the point where they lose their potency. But if you could share a few of those."
    },

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's good. We're actually pretty open book on this. So first of all, yes. So there are people who definitely try to come in and basically present as being something that they're not, and they've read all the books. They will have listened to this interview. They study everything and they construct a facade and they come in and present to something they're not. I would say the amount of that varies exactly, correlated to the Nasdaq. Right. And so when stock prices are super low, like, you actually get the opposite. When stock prices are super low, people get too demoralized. And people who should be doing it basically give up because they just think that the industry is over, the trend is over, whatever. It's all hopeless. And so you get this flushing thing. So nobody ever shows up at a stock market low, right. And says, like, I'm the new next big thing and doesn't really want to do it because there are higher status. The kinds of people who do the thing that you're talking about, they're fundamentally oriented for social status. They're trying to get the social status without actually, without actually the substance. And there are always other places to go get social status. So after 2000, the joke was, so when I got to Silicon Valley in 93, 94, the valley was dead. We can talk about that. By 98, it was roaring. And you had a lot of these people showing up who were basically, basically had a lot of people showing up with stories. 2000, the market crashed. By 2001, the joke was that there were these terms, b, two c and b, two b. And in 1998 they meant b, two c, meant business to consumer and b, two b, meant business to business, which is the two different kinds of business models for Internet companies. By 2001, b, two b, meant back to banking and b, two c, meant back to consulting, which is the high status. People oriented to status who showed up to be in tech were like, yeah, screw it. Like, this is over. Stick a fork in it. Im going to go back to Goldman Sachs or go back to McKinsey, where I can be high status. You get this flushing effect that happens in a downturn. That said, in a big upswing, you get a lot of people showing up with a lot of, you know, with a lot of, you know, kind of, let's say, public Persona without the substance to back it up. So the way we stress that you can actually say exactly how we test for this, which, because the test exactly addresses the issue in a way that is impossible to fake. And it's actually this. It's actually the same way homicide detectives try to find out if you've, if you, if you're, if you actually, like, if you're innocent or whether you've killed somebody. It's the same, it's the same tactic, which is you, you ask increasingly detailed questions, right. And so, you know, the way the homicide cop does this is, you know, what were you doing last night? You know, oh, I was at a movie. Which movie? You know, which theater? You know? Okay, which seat did you sit in? You know, okay, what was the end of the movie? Right. Like, right. And you ask increasingly detailed questions and people have trouble. At some point, people have trouble making up, and things just fuzz into just kind of obvious bullshit. And basically fake founders basically have the same problem. They have a, they're able to relay a conceptual theory of what they're doing that they've kind of engineered. But as they get into the details, it just, it just fuzzes out. Whereas the true people that you want to back, that can do it, basically what you find is they've spent five or ten or 20 years obsessing on the details of whatever it is they're about to do. And they're so deep in the details that they know so much more about it than you ever will. And in fact, the best possible reaction is when they get mad, which is also what the homicide cops say. What you actually want is you want the emotional response of, like, I can't believe that you're asking me questions this detailed and specific and picky, and they kind of figure out what you're doing, and then they get upset. That's perfect. But then they have to prove in themselves in the sense of they have to be able to answer the questions in great detail."

Or do you think that they have a vision and no matter what, it will work out because the world will sort of bend around it? I mean, in other words, do you think that they place their vision in context, or they simply have a vision and they have that tunnel vision of that thing and that's gonna be it? Let's use you for an example with Netscape. I mean, that's how I first came to know your name when you were conceiving Netscape. Do you think, okay, there's this search engine and this browser, and it's going to be this thing that looks this way and works this way and feels this way. Did you think that, and also think about that there was going to be a gallery of other search engines and it would fit into that landscape of other search engines?

        "text": "Let me give the general answer, and then we can talk about the specific example. So the general answer is what? Entrepreneurship, creativity, innovation is what economists called decision making under uncertainty. And so in both parts, those are important decision making. Like, you're going to make a ton of decisions because you have to decide what to do, what not to do. And then uncertainty, which is like, the world's a complicated place, right? And in mathematical terms, the world is a complex adaptive system with feedback loops. And, like, it's really, I mean, it's extreme. You know, Isaac Asimov wrote in his novels, he wrote about this field called psychohistory, right? Which is the idea that there's like a supercomputer that can predict the future of human affairs, right? And it's like, we don't have that. Not yet."

        "text": "We certainly don't have that yet. And so you're just dealing, you know, military commanders call this the fog of war, right? You're just dealing with a situation where the number of variables are just off the charts. It's all these other people, right, who are inherently unpredictable, making all these decisions in different directions. And then the whole system is combinatorial, which is these people are colliding with each other, influencing their decisions. And so, I mean, look, the most straightforward kind of way to think about this is just, it's amazing. Like, anybody who believes in economic central planning, it always blows my mind because it's just like, try opening a restaurant. Like, try just opening a restaurant on the corner down here. And, like, 50 50 odds the restaurant's gonna work. And like, all you have to do to run a restaurant is like, have a thing and serve food and, like. And it's like, most restaurants fail, right? And so. And restaurant people run restaurants are, like, pretty smart. Like, they're. They usually think about these things very hard. They all want to succeed, and it's hard to do that. And so to start a tech company or to start an artistic movement or to fight a war, you're just going into this basically about conceptual battleground or military terms, real battleground, where there's just incredible levels of complexity, branching future paths, and so there's nothing predictable. And so what we look for is basically the sort of drop the really good innovators. They've got a drive to basically be able to cope with that and deal with that. Basically do that in two steps. So one is they try to pre plan as much as they possibly can. And we call that the process of navigating the. We call the idea maze. The idea maze basically is I've got this general idea, and it might be the Internet's going to work or search or whatever, and then it's like, okay, in their head, they have thought through of like, okay, if I do it this way, that way, this third way, here's what will happen. Then I have to do that. Then I have to do this, then I have to bring in somebody to do that. Here's the technical challenge I'm going to hit. And they've got in there, they got in their heads as best anybody could. They've got as complete a sort of a map of possible futures as they could possibly have. And this is where I say, when you ask them increasingly detailed questions, that's what you're trying to get them to chart out is, okay, how far ahead have you thought? And how much are you anticipating all of the different twists and turns that this is going to take? Okay, so then they start on day one, and then, of course, what happens is now they're in it, now they're in the fog of war, they're in future uncertainty. And now that idea maze is maybe not helpful practically, but now they're going to be basically constructing on the fly, day by day, as they learn and discover new things and as the world changes around them. And of course, it's a feedback loop, because they're going to change. If their thing starts to work, it's going to change the world. And then the fact the world is changing is going to cause their plan to change as well. And so, yeah, the great ones, basically, they course correct the great ones course correct every single day. They take stock of what they've learned. They modified the plan. The great ones tend to think in terms of hypotheses, like a scientific sort of mentality, which is they tend to think, okay, I'm going to try this. Like I'm going to go into the world, I'm going to announce that I'm doing this for sure. I'm going to say this is my plan. I'm going to tell all my employees that, I'm going to tell all my investors that. I'm going to put a stake in there. That's my plan, and then I'm going to try it. Even though I sound like I have complete certainty, I know that I need to test to find out whether it's going to work. If it's not, then I have to go back to all those same people and I have to say, well, actually, we're not going left, we're going right. They have to run that loop thousands of times to get through the other side. This led to the creation of this great term pivot, which has been very helpful in our industry because the word, when I was young, the word we used was fuck up. Pivot sounds so much better, sounds like so much more professional. But yeah, you make mistakes. It's just too complicated to understand. You course correct, you adjust, you evolve. Often these things, at least in business, the businesses that end up working really well tend to be different than the original plan. But that's part of the process of a really smart founder basically working their way through reality, right, as they're executing their plan."

        "text": "The way you're describing this has parallels to a lot of models in biology and the practice of science, random walks, but that aren't truly random, pseudo random walks in biology, et cetera. But one thing that is becoming clear from the way you're describing this, is that I could imagine a great risk to early success. So, for instance, somebody develops a product, people are excited by it, they start to implement that product, but then the landscape changes, and they don't learn how to pivot to use the less profane version of it, right? They don't learn how to do that, in other words, and I think of everything these days, or most everything, in terms of reward schedules and dopamine reward schedules, because that is the universal currency of reward. And so when you talk about the Sean Parker quote of learning to enjoy the taste of one's own blood, that is very different than learning to enjoy the taste of success. That's right. It's about internalizing success as a process of being self determined and less agreeable, et cetera. In other words, building up of those five traits becomes the source of dopamine, perhaps in a way that's highly adaptive. So on the outside, we just see the product, the end product, the iPhone, the MacBook, the netscape, etcetera. But I have to presume, and I'm not a psychologist, but I have done neurophysiology and I've studied the dopamine system enough to know that. And what's being rewarded in the context of what you're describing sounds to be a reinforcement of those five traits, rather than, oh, it's going to be this particular product, or the Company's going to look this way, or the logo is going to be this or that. That all seems like the peripheral to what's really going on. That great innovators are really in the process of establishing neural circuitry that is all about reinforcing the me and the process of being me."

        "text": "Yeah, yeah. So this goes to. Yeah, so this is like extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation. So the Steve Jobs kind of Zen version of this, right? Or the sort of hippie version of this was the journey is the reward, right? He always told his employees that it's like, look, like, you know, everybody thinks in terms of these big public markers, like the stock price or the IPO or the product launch or whatever. He's like, no, it's actually the process itself is the point. Right? And if you had to your point, if you have that mentality, then that's it. That's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic motivation. And so that's the kind of intrinsic motivation that can keep you going for a long time. Another way to think about it is competing against yourself. It's like, can I get better at doing this? And can I prove to myself that I can get better? There's also a big social component to this, and this is one of the reasons why Silicon Valley punches so far above its weight as a place. There's a psychological component which also goes to the comparison set. A phenomenon that we've observed over time is the leading tech company in any city will aspire to be as large as the previous leading tech company in that city, but often not larger. Right? Because they sort of had, they have a model of success, and as long as they beat that level of success, they've kind of checked the box like they've made it. But then, in contrast, you're in Silicon Valley, and you look around and it's just like Facebook and Cisco and Oracle and Tulip Packard and gladiators. Yeah. And you're just like looking at these giants and many of them are still Mark Zuckerberg, still going to work every day and, like, trying to do, like. And so, like, these people are like, you know, the role models are like, alive. Right, right. They're like, right there. Right. And it's so clear, like, how much better they are and how much bigger their accomplishments are. And so what we find is young founders in that environment have much greater aspirations. Right. Because they just, again, it could, maybe it's, maybe at that point, maybe it's the social status, maybe there's, there's an extrinsic component to that, but maybe it helps calibrate that internal system to basically say, actually, you know, no, the opportunity here is not to build a local, you know, what you might call local maximum form of success, but let's build to a global maximum form of success, which is something as big as we possibly can. Ultimately, the great ones are probably driven more internally than externally when it comes down to it. And that is where you get this phenomenon where you get people who are extremely successful and extremely wealthy, who very easily could punch out and move to Fiji and just call it, and they're still working 16 hours days. Obviously, something explains that that has nothing to do with external reward. And I think it's an internal thing."

Athletic greens, now called ag one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics in athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com Huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera, and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D, three, k, two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com Huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D, three k, two. I've heard you talk a lot about the inner landscape, the inner psychology of these folks, and I appreciate that. We're going even deeper into that today. And we will talk about the landscape around whether or not Silicon Valley or New York, whether or not there are specific cities that are ideal for certain types of pursuits. I think there was an article written by Paul Graham some years ago about the conversations that you overhear in a city will tell you everything you need to know about whether or not you belong there in terms of your professional pursuits. Some of that's changed over time, and now we should probably add Austin to the mix because it was written some time ago. In any event, I want to return to that, but I want to focus on an aspect of this intrinsic versus extrinsic motivators in terms of something that's a bit more cryptic, which is one's personal relationships. If I think about the catalog of innovators in Silicon Valley, some of them, like Steve Jobs, had complicated personal lives, romantic personal lives, early on, and it sounds like he worked it out. I don't know. I wasn't there. Couples therapists. But when he died, he was in a marriage that for all the world, seemed like a happy marriage. You also have examples of innovators who have had many partners, many children with other partners. Elon comes to mind. I don't think I'm disclosing anything that isn't already. Obviously, those could have been happy relationships and just had many of them. But the reason I'm asking this is you can imagine that for the innovator, the person with these traits, who's trying to build up this thing, whatever it is, that having someone, or several people in some cases, who just truly believe in you when the rest of the world may not believe in you yet or at all, could be immensely powerful. And we have examples from cults that embody this. We have examples from politics. We have examples from tech innovation and science. And I've always been fascinated by this because I feel like it's the more cryptic and yet very potent form of allowing someone to build themselves up. It's a combination of inner psychology and extrinsic motivation. Because obviously, if that person were to die or leave them or or cheat on them or pair up with some other innovator, which we've seen several times recently and in the past. It can be devastating to that person. But what are your thoughts on the role of personal and in particular romantic relationship as it relates to people having an idea and they're feeling that they can really bring that idea to fruition in the world?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. Right. And, you know, maybe you just need to find the right person who, like, compliments that and is willing to. You know, there's a lot of relationships where, like you, it's always this question about relationships, right? Which is, do you want to have the same personality, you know, growth profile, the same behavioral traits, basically, as your partner, or do you actually want to have, you know, is it an opposites thing? And, you know, like, I'm sure you've seen this. There are relationships where you'll have somebody who's highly disagreeable, who's paired with somebody who's highly agreeable, and it actually works out great. Great. Because one person just gets to be on their soapbox all the time, and the other person's just like, okay, right. And it's fine, right? It's fine. It's good. You know, you put two disagreeable people together, you know, maybe sparks fly and they have great conversations all the time, and maybe they come to hate each other, right? And so, so anyway, so these people, if you're going to be with one of these people, you're fishing out of the disagreeable end of the pond. And again, when I say disagreeable, I don't mean, you know, these are. These are normal distributions. I don't mean, like 60% disagreeable or 80% disagreeable. The people we're talking about are 99.99% disagreeable. Right? So these are ornery, ornery people. So part of it's that. And then, of course, they have the other personality traits, right? They're super conscientious. They're super driven. As a consequence, they tend to work really hard. They tend to not have a lot of time for family vacations or other things. Then they don't enjoy them if they're forced to go on them. And so, again, that kind of thing can fray at a relationship. So there's a fair amount in there that's loaded. Like, somebody who's going to partner with one of these people needs to be signed up for the ride. And that's a hard thing. You know, that's a hard thing to do. Or you need a true partnership of two of these, which is also hard to do. So I think that's part of it. And then, look, I think a big part of it is people achieve a certain level of success, and either in their own minds or publicly, and then they start to be able to get away with things and they start to be able to, like, well, okay, now we're rich and successful and famous, and now I deserve. And this is where you get into. I view this now in the realm of personal choice. You get in this thing where people start to think that they deserve things, and so they start to behave in very bad ways, and then they blow up their personal worlds as a consequence. And maybe they regret it later, and maybe they don't. Right? It's always a question. So, yeah, so I think there's that. And then, I don't know. Yeah, some people just need. Maybe the other part of it is some people just need more emotional support than others. And I don't know that that's a big. I don't know that that tilts either way. Like, I know. I know some of these people who have, like, great, loving relationships and seem to draw very much on how having this kind of firm foundation to rely upon. And then I know other people who are just, like, their personal lives are just a continuous train wreck. And it doesn't seem. Doesn't seem to matter. Like, professionally, they just keep doing what they're doing. And maybe there's a. Maybe we could talk here about, like, you know, whatever is the personality trait for risk taking. Right. Some people are so incredibly risk prone that they need to take risk in all aspects of their lives at all times. And if part of their life gets stable, they find a way to blow it up. And that some of these people you could describe in those terms also."

        "text": "Yeah, I just have it on auto recall so that I can get out of these things. But so here's the thing that get me kicked out of a dinner party, especially these days. So think of the kind of person where it's very clear that they're super high. To your point, there's somebody who's super high output, whatever domain they're in, they've done things that have fundamentally changed the world. They've brought new, whether it's businesses or technologies or works of art, entire schools of creative expression, in some cases, to the world. And then at a certain point, they blow themselves to smithereens. And they do that either through a massive financial scandal, they do that through a massive personal breakdown. They do that through some sort of public expression that causes them a huge amount of problems. They say the wrong thing, maybe not once, but several hundred times, and blow themselves to smithereens. And there's this. There's this kind of arc, there's this moral arc that people kind of want to apply, which it's like the Icarus flying too close to the sun, and he had it coming, and he needed to keep his ego under control. And you get kind of this judgment that applies. So I have a different theory on this. So the term I use to describe these people, and a lot of, and by the way, a lot of other people who don't actually blow themselves up but get close to it, which is a whole other set of people. I call them martyrs to civilizational progress. We're backwards. Civilizational progress. So look, the only way civilization gets moved forward is when people like this do something new because civilization as a whole does not do new things. Groups of people do not do new things. These things don't happen automatically. By default, nothing changes. The only way civilizational change on any of these axes ever happens is because one of these people, people stands up and says, you know, no, I'm going to do something different than what everybody else has ever done before. So this is progress. Like, this is actually how it happens. Sometimes they get lionized or awarded. Sometimes they get crucified. Sometimes the crucification is literal. Sometimes it's just, you know, symbolic. But like, you know, they are those kinds of people. And then, and then, and then murders, like when they go down in flames, like they have. And again, this is where it really screws the people's moral judgments. Everybody wants to have this sort of super clear story of like, okay, he did a bad thing and he was punished. And I'm like, no, no, no. He was the kind of person who was going to do great things and also was going to take on a level of risk and take on a level of sort of extreme behavior such that he was going to expose himself to flying too close to the sun. Wings melt and crashed the ground. But it's a package deal, right? The reason you have the Picassos and the Beethovens and all these people is because they're willing to take these extreme level of risks. They are that creative and original, not just in their art or their business, but in everything else that they do that they will set themselves up to be able to fail psychologically. A psychologist would probably, or psychiatrist would probably say maybe. To what extent do they actually have a death wish? Do they actually at some point do they want to punish themselves? Do they want to fail? That I don't know. But you see this. They deliberately move themselves too close to the sun. You can see it when it's happening because if they get too far away from the sun, they deliberately move back towards it. They come right back and they, they want the risk. And so anyway, so martyrs to civilizational progress. This is how progress happens. When these people crash and burn, the national inclination is to judge them morally. I tend to think we should basically say, look, and I don't even know if this means even the memorial pass or whatever. But it's like, look, this is how civilization progresses, and we need to at least understand that there's a self sacrificial aspect to this that may be tragic and often is tragic, but it is quite literally selfdevelop sacrificial."

They're extreme risk takers in business. They're completely buttoned down on the personal side, they're completely buttoned down financially. They're scrupulous with following every rule and law you can possibly imagine, but they're still fantastic innovators. And then I know many others who are just like, their life is on fire all the time, in every possible way. And whenever it looks like the fire is turning into embers, they figure out a way to relight the fire, and they just really want to live on the edge. And so I think that's maybe, I think that's an independent variable. And again, I would apply the same thing. I think the same thing applies to the arts. You know, classical music as an example, like, I think Bach was, you know, as an example, one of the, you know, kind of best, you know, musicians of all time had just a completely sedate personal life, you know, never had any aberrant behavior at all in his personal life. You know, family man, tons of kids, apparently, you know, pillar of the community. Right.

Do you think that we are limiting the number of innovations in total by just simply frightening or eliminating an enormous category of innovators because they don't have the confidence or the means or the strategies in place to regulate?

        "text": "So the ultimate definition of an elite is who can get who fired, right? Like, that's the ultimate test. Who can get who fired. Boycotted, blacklisted, ostracized. Like when pushed, prosecuted, jailed, like, when push comes to shove. Right. I think that's always the question, who can destroy whose career? And of course, you'll notice that that is heavily asymmetric when these fights play out. Like, there's very clear which side can get the other side fired and which side. Which side can't. And so, yeah, so, look, I think we live in a period of time where the elites have gotten to be extreme in a number of dimensions. And I think it's characterized by, for sure, extreme groupthink, extreme sanctimony, extreme moral, I say dudgeon extreme, this weird sort of modern puritanism, and then an extreme sort of morality of, like, punishment and terror against their perceived enemies. But I want to go through that because I actually think. I actually think that's a very different phenomenon. I think what's happening at the elites is very different than what's happening in the population at large. And then, of course, I think there's a feedback loop in there, which is, I think the population at large is not on board with that program. Right. I think the elites are aware that the population is not on board with that program. I think they judge the population negative negatively as a consequence. That causes the elites to harden their own positions. That causes them to be even more alienating to the population. And so they're in sort of an oppositional negative feedback loop. And yeah, it's going to be. But again, it's a sort of question, okay, who can get who fired? And so elites are really good at getting normal people fired. Ostracized, banned, hit pieces in the press, like, whatever. For normal people to get elites fired, they have to really band together and really mount a serious challenge, which mostly doesn't happen, but might be starting to happen in some cases."

I mean, when you think social media, you think you're giving each and every person their own little reality tv show, their own voice. And yet we've seen a dramatic uptick in the number of cancellations and firings related to immoral behavior based on things that were either done or amplified on social media. It's almost as if the public is holding the wrong end of the knife."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So the way I describe it. So you use these two terms, and they're somewhat interchangeable, but elites and institutions. And then they're somewhat interchangeable because who runs the institutions? The elites. Right. And so it's a sort of a self reinforcing thing. Institutions of all kinds, institutions, everything from the government, bureaucracies, companies, nonprofits, foundations, NGO's, tech companies, on and on and on. People who are in charge of big complexes and that carry a lot of basically power and influence and capability and money as a consequence of their positional authority. So the head of a giant foundation may never have done anything in their life that would cause somebody to have a high opinion of them as a person. But they're in charge this gigantic multi billion dollar complex and have all this power results. And so that's just defined terms, at least institutions. So it's actually interesting. Gallup has been doing polls on the following on the question of trust in institutions, which is sort of a therefore proxy for trust in elites, basically since the early 1970s. And what you find, and they do this across all the categories of big institutions. Basically everyone. I just talked about a bunch of others. Big business, small business, bank, newspapers, broadcast television, the military, police. So they've got like 30 categories or something. And basically what you see is almost all the categories basically started in the early seventies at like 60 or 70% trust. And now they've basically almost across the board, they've just had a complete, basically linear slide down for 50 years, basically my whole life. And they're now bottoming out. Congress and journalists bottom out at like 10%. The two groups everybody hates are like Congress and journalists. And then it's like a lot of other big institutions are like 20, in their twenties, thirties, forties, actually. Big business actually scores fairly high. Tech actually scores quite high. The military scores quite high. But basically everything else has really caved in. And so this is sort of my fundamental challenge to everybody who basically says, and you didn't do this, but you'll hear the simple form of this, which is social media caused the current trouble. And let's call this an example, collapse in faith in institutions and elites. Let's call that part of the current trouble. Everybody's like, well, social media caused that. I was like, well, no, social media. Social media is new, right? In the last. Social media is effectively new, practically speaking, since 2010, 2012 is when it really took off. And so if the trend started in the early 1970s and has been continuous, then we're dealing with something broader. And Martin Gurry wrote, I think, the best book on this called the revolt to the public, where he goes through this in detail. And he does say that social media had a lot to do with what's happened in the last decade. But he says is, yeah, if you go back, you look further, it was basically two things coinciding. One was just a general change in the media environment. And in particular, the 1970s is when you started, especially in the 1980s, is when you started to get specifically talk radio, which was a new outlet. And then you also start, you also got cable television. And then you also, by the way, it's actually interesting, in the fifties, sixties, you had paperback books, which was another one of these, which was an outlet. So you had like a fracturing in the media landscape that started in the fifties, through the eighties. And then, of course, the Internet, like, blew it wide open. Having said that, if the elites and the institutions were fantastic, you would know it more than ever. Previous information is more accessible. And so the other thing that he says, and I agree with, is the public is not being tricked into thinking the elite institutions are bad. They're learning that they're bad, right? And the mystery, and therefore, the mystery of the Gallup poll is why those numbers all just zero, right? Which is arguably, in a lot of cases where they should be."

You're going to left with a completely, basically atomized, out of control society that has no ability to marshal any sort of activity in any direction.

But secondarily, that we've seen some movements that have essentially rooted themselves in tweets, in comments, in posts that get amplified. And those tweets and comments and posts come from everyday people. In fact, I can't name one person who initiated a given cancellation or movement because it was the sort of dog piling or mob adding on to some person that was essentially anonymous. So I think that for many of us, we have the bottom, to use neuroscience language as sort of a bottom up perspective. Oh, you know, someone sees something in their daily life, or experiences something in their daily life, and they tweet about it or they comment about it or they post about it, and then enough people dogpile on the accused that it picks up force, and then the elites feel compelled, obligated to cancel somebody. That tends to be the narrative. And so I think the logical conclusion is, oh, you know, social media allows for this to happen, whereas normally someone would just be standing on the corner shouting or calling lawyers that don't have faith in them, and you get like the Erin Brockovich model, that turns into a movie. But that's a rare case of this lone woman who's got this idea in mind about how big institution is doing wrong or somebody is doing wrong in the world and then can leverage big institutions. Excuse me, but the way that you describe it is that the elites are leading this shift. So what is the role of the public in it? I mean, just to give it a concrete example, if, for instance, no one tweeted or commented on me too, or no one tweeted or commented about some ill behavior of some, I don't know, university faculty member or business person, would the elite have come down on them anyway."

It's all wrapped up together like they're true believers, but they're also getting paid to do it.

So this is what the social media companies have been on the receiving end of for the last decade is it's basically a political media activism complex with very deep pockets behind it. And you've got people who basically, literally people who sit all day and watch the tv network on the other side or watch the Twitter feeds the other side, and they basically, wait. It's like every politician, this has been the case for a long time now. Every politician who goes out and gives stump speeches, you'll see there's always somebody in the crowd with a camcorder now with a phone recording them, and that's somebody from the other campaign who's paid somebody to just be there and, like, record every single thing the politician says. So that when Emitt Romney says whatever, the 47% thing, they've got it on tape and then they clip it and they try to make it viral. So this stuff is, and again, like, look, like these people believe what they're doing. I'm not saying it's even dishonest. Like, these people believe what they're doing. They think they're fighting a holy war. They think they're protecting democracy. They think they're protecting civilization. They think they're protecting whatever it is they're protecting. And then they know how to use the tool, and so they know how to, they know how to try to gin up the outrage. And then, by the way, sometimes it works in social cascades. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes they cascade, sometimes they don't. But if you follow these people on Twitter, this is what they do every day.

And all of a sudden, a different kind of boycott movement has all of a sudden started to work that wasn't working before that. And another kind of boycott movement is not working as well anymore. And so, for sure, there's an intermediation happening. Like, look, the stuff that's happening, the world today is being intermediated through social media because social media is the defining media of our time. But there are people who know how to do this and do this for a living. So, no, I very much view this as a, I view very much the cancellation wave. Like, this whole thing, it's an elite phenomenon. And when it appears to be a grassroots thing, it's either grassroots among the elites, which is possible because there's a fairly large number of people who are signed up for that, you know, that particular crusade. But there's also a lot of astroturfing that's taking place inside that. The question is, okay, at what point does the population at large get pulled into this? And maybe there are movements at certain points in time where they do get pulled in, and then maybe later they get disillusioned. And so then there's some question there. And then there's another question of, like, well, if the population at large is going to decide what these movements are, are they going to be the same movements that the elites want? And how are the elites going to react when the population actually, like, fully expresses itself? Right? And so there's, and like I said, there's a feedback loop between these where the more extreme the elites get, they tend to push the population to more extreme views on the other side and vice versa.

And everybody always wants to reform everything, and yet somehow, like, nothing ever quite ever gets reformed. Right. And so people are trying to reform, you know, housing policy in the Bay area for decades. And, you know, we're not building, we're building fewer houses ever before.

There's all the bureaucratic red tape about trying to get things done and how to implement decisions is very hard, and there are a lot of reasons for that. And then, of course, there are the things that many people are aware of are there are public accusations about people in positions of great leadership, and that's getting played out. And the whole thing becomes kind of overwhelming and a little bit opaque when you're just trying to run your lab or live your life. And so I think one of the reasons for this lack of reform that you're referring to is because there's no position of reformer, right? So deans are dealing with a lot of issues. Provosts are dealing with a lot of issues. Presidents are dealing with a lot of issues, and then some in some cases. And so we don't have a dedicated role of reformer, someone to go in and say, listen, there's just a lot of fat on this and we need to train or we need to create this or do that. There just isn't a system to do that. And that's, I think, in part because universities are built on old systems, and it's like the New York subway. It's amazing.

Most people have no connectivity to them whatsoever. In the statistics, in the polling, universities are not doing well. The population at large. Yeah, they may have fantasies about their kid going to Stanford, but, like, the reality of it is they have a very, very collapsing view of these institutions. So anyway, this actually goes straight to the question of alternatives then, right? Which is like, okay, if you believe that there's collapsing faith in the institutions, if you believe that it is merited, at least in some ways, if you believe that reform is effectively impossible, then you are faced, and we could debate each of those, but the population at large seems to believe a lot of that. Then there's a question of, okay, can it be replaced? And if so, are you better off replacing these things basically, while the old things still exist? Or do you actually need to basically clear the field to be able to have the new thing exists? The universities are a great case study of this because of the student, because of how student loans work, right? And the way student loans work is to be able to be, to be an actual competitive university and compete. You need to have access to federal student lending, because if you don't, everybody has to pay out of pocket, and it's completely out of reach for anybody other than a certain class of either extremely rich or foreign students. So you need access to federal student loan facility. To get access to federal student loan facility, you need to be an accredited university. Guess who runs the accreditation council?"

It probably can't be done as long as existing institutions are actually intact.

I mean, there's a nihilistic streak in the culture and the politics today. There are people who basically would just say, yeah, just tear the whole system down without any particular plan for what follows. And so I think he makes a good point in that you want to be careful that you actually have a plan on the other side that you think is actually achievable. But again, the counterargument to that is if you're not willing to actually tear down the old, you're not going to get to the new. Now, what's interesting, of course, is this is what happens every day in business, right? So, like, the entire way, like, how do you know that the capitalist system works? The way that you know is that the old companies, when they're no longer, like the best at what they do, they get torn down, and then they ultimately die and they get replaced by better companies."

It's like the best defense against antitrust charges is no, people are coming to kill us, and they're doing a really good job of it. That's how we know we're doing our job. And in fact, in business, we are specifically. It is specifically illegal for companies in the same industry to get together and plot and conspire and plan and have things like these accreditation bureaus. If I created the equivalent in my companies of the kind accreditation bureau that the universities have, I'd get straight to federal prison and a trust violation. Sherman acts straight to prison. People have been sent to prison for that. So in the business world, we know that you want everything subject to market competition. We know that you want creative destruction. We know that you want replacement of the old with superior new. It's just once we get outside of business, we're like, oh, we don't want any of that. We want basically stagnation and log rolling, right? And basically institutional incestuous, like entanglements and conflicts of interest as far as the eye can see, and then we're surprised by the results."

They're allowed to be there. They're allowed to be a student or a faculty member or administrator. And let's just say this accreditation bureau allowed student loans for this one particular university. Or let's say that there was an independent source of funding for that university such that students could just apply there. They didn't need to be part of this elite, accredited group, which sounds very mafia like, frankly, not necessarily violent, but certainly coercive in the way that it walls people out of.

Certainly cancellation and the risk of cancellation from the way that we framed it earlier, is going to discourage risk takers of the category of risk takers that take risk in every domain that really like to fly close to the sun and sometimes into the sun or are."

And the way that he did it was he went in ahead of time and hacked the simulator, right. It was the only way to actually get through.

And the big debate at the time was because they knew they wanted to build computers. They had the basic idea, and there had been, like, calculating machines before that, and there had been, like, there had been these looms that you basically programmed to punch cards. And so there was like a. There was a prehistory to computers that had to do with building sort of increasingly complex calculating machines. So they were kind of on a track, but they knew they were going to be able to build what they call a general purpose computer that could basically, you could program in the way that you program computers today. But they had a big debate early on, which is, should the fundamental architecture of the computer be based on either a, like, calculating machines, like cache registers and looms and. Right. And other things like that, or should it be based on a model of the human brain? And they actually had this idea of computers model on the human brain back then, and this was this concept of so called neural networks. And it's actually fairly astonishing from a research standpoint. The original paper on neural networks actually was published in 1943. So they didn't have our level of neuroscience, but they actually knew about the neuron, and they actually had a theory of neurons interconnecting and synapses and information processing in the brain even back then. And a lot of people at the time basically said, you know what? We should basically have the computer from the startbeat model after the human brain. Like, if we could, if the computer could do everything that the human brain can do, like, that would be the best possible general purpose computer. And then you could have it do jobs and you could have it create art, and you could have it do all kinds of things like humans can do. It turns out that didn't happen in our world. What happened instead was the industry went in the other direction. It went basically in the model of the calculating machine or the cash register. And I think practically speaking, that kind of had to be the case because that was actually the technology that was practical at the time. But that's the path. So what we all have experiences with, up to and including the iPhone in our pocket, is computers built on that basically calculating machine model, not the human brain model. And so what that means is computers, as we have come to understand them, they're basically like mathematical savants at best, right? So they're really good at doing lots of mathematical calculations. They're really good at executing these extremely detailed computer programs. They're hyper literal. One of the things you learn early when you're a programmer is as the human programmer, you have to get every single instruction to give the computer correct because it will do exactly what you tell it to do. And bugs in computer programs are always a mistake on the part of the programmer."

I can't blame the computer. The computer has no judgment. It has no ability to interpret, synthesize, you know, develop an independent understanding of anything. It's just, it's literally just doing what I tell it to do step by step. So, so for 80 years we've had this just, you know, this very kind of hyper literal, you know, kind of, kind of model computers. These are called, technically, these are what are called von Neumann machines based after the mathematician John von Neumann. They run in that way, and they've been very successful and very important, and our world has been shaped by them. But there was always this other idea out there, which is, okay, how about a completely different approach, which is based much more on how the human brain operates, or at least our best understanding of how the human brain operates, because those aren't the same thing. It basically says, okay, what if you could have a computer instead of being hyper literal? What if you could have it actually be conceptual and creative and able to synthesize information and able to draw judgments and able to behave in ways that are not deterministic, but are rather creative. And the applications for this, of course, are endless. For example, the self driving car, the only way that you cannot program a computer with rules. To make it a self driving car, you have to do what Tesla and Waymo and these other companies have done. Now you have to use AI, you have to use this other architecture, and you have to basically teach them how to recognize objects in images at high speeds, basically the same way the human brain does.

It's the same challenge we have when we're driving. You don't want to swerve to avoid a shopping bag because you might hit something that you didn't see on the side. If it's a small child, for sure, you want to swerve. But in that moment, and small children come in different, like, shapes and descriptions and are wearing different kinds of clothes."

And this is why there's always been such a stark divide between what the machine can do and what the. And what the human can do. And so basically what's happened is in the last decade, that second type of computer, the neural network based computer, has started to actually work. It started to work, actually.

Now, you would be smartest to put all your money on the machine. You want to find faces in airports, even with masks on.

And the likely to be most successful industries give chat JPT that. If it's pooling across all text, how does it know what is authentically Mark Andreessen's text? Because in the case of face recognition, you've got a standard to work from a verified image versus everything else. In the case of text, you have to make sure that what you're starting with is verified text from your mouth, which makes sense if it's coming from video.

Almost all text on the Internet was written by a human being, and then most of that was written by people under their own names. Some of it wasn't, but a lot. But a lot of it was. And why do you know this, for me, is because it was published in a magazine under my name, or it's a podcast transcript and it's under my name. And generally speaking, if you just did a search on what are things market reason is written and said 90 plus percent of that would be. Would be correct.

They take all that data collectively, they put it in there, and that's why this works as well as it does. And that's why if you ask chat GPT to speak or write like me or like you or like, you know, somebody else, it will actually generally do a really good job because it has that. It has all of our prior text in its training data. That said, from here on out, this gets harder. And of course, the reason this gets harder is because now we have AI that can create text.

Every kid in the class is using chat GPT to write their essays or to help them write their essays, and then the teacher is using one of. There's a tool that you can use that it purports to be able to tell you whether something was written by Chadgpt, but it's only right, like 60% of the time. And so there was this case where the student wrote an essay where their parents sat and watched them write the essay and then they submitted it, and this tool got the conclusion incorrect. And then the student feels outraged because he got unfairly cheated. But the teacher is like, well, you're all using the tool. Then it turns out there's another tool that basically you feed in text, and it actually is sort of, they call it a summarizer, but what it really is is it's a cheating mechanism to basically just shuffle the words around enough so that it sheds whatever characteristics were associated with AI. So there's like an arms race going on in educational settings right now around this exact question. I don't, I don't think it's possible to do. There are people working on the watermark. I don't think it's possible with the watermarking. And I think it's just kind of obvious why it's not possible to do that, which is you can just read the output for yourself. It's, it's really good. How are you actually going to tell the difference between that and something that a real person wrote a. And then, by the way, you can also ask jet GPT to write in different styles, right? So you can tell it like, you know, write in the style of a 15 year old, right. You can tell it to write in the style of, you know, a non native english speaker, right. Or if you're a non native english speaker, you can tell it to write in the style of an english speaker. Native english speaker. Right. And so the tool itself will help you evade.

And you would just publish like in the about me page on YouTube, you would just publish your public cryptographic key that's unique to you. And then anytime anybody wants to check to see whether any piece of content is actually you, they go to a registry in the cloud somewhere and they basically submit. They basically say, okay, is this him? And then they can basically to see whether somebody with your public key you had actually certified that this was something that you made. Now, who runs that registry is an interesting question. If that registry is run by the government, we will call that the ministry of truth. I think that's probably a bad idea. If that registry is run by a company, we would call that basically the equivalent of a credit bureau or something like that. Maybe that's how it happens.

Right. So there were no patients experimented on here. This was a test contained within the medical world.

The side effect of that. And by the way, look, it's a hell of a job to have to go in and tell somebody that they're going to die, right. Or that they have, so you're never going to recover, they're never going to walk again or whatever it is. And so there's sort of something inherent in that job where they need to keep emotional reserve from the patient to be able to do the job. And it's expected of them as professionals. The machine has no such limitation. The machine can be as sympathetic as you want it to be for as long as you want it to be. It could be infinitely sympathetic. It's happy to talk to you at four in the morning. It's happy to sympathize with you. And by the way, it's not just sympathizing you in the way that, oh, it's just lying.

Can you keep a patient off of drugs or alcohol? Right.

So there's a universe here that it goes to what you said, there's a universe here that's opening up, which is what I believe is it's partnership between man and machine.

I could imagine it being tactile, having some haptics, so tapping to remind me so that it's not going to enter our conversation in a way that it interferes or distracts you. But I would be aware. Oh, right. Things of that sort. How many different modalities are we going to allow these AI coaches to approach us with?

So the entrepreneurial community is going to try all of those, by the way, the big companies and startups are going to try all those.

There's lots of people doing voice. You know, the voice thing is, voice is a real possibility. It may just be an earpiece. There's a new startup that just unveiled a new thing where it's actually, they actually project. So you'll have like a pendant you wear on, like a necklace, and it actually, like, projects. Like, literally, it will like project images, like on your hand or like on the table or on the wall in front of you. So, like, maybe that's how it shows up. Up. Yeah. There are people working on so called haptic or touch based kinds of things. There are people working on actually picking up nerve signals, like out of your arm. Right. To be able to be able to. There's people, there's some science for being able to do basically, like sub vocalization. So maybe you could pick up that way bone conduction. So, yeah, these are all going to be tried. So that's one question is the physical form of it, then the other question is the software version of it, which is like, okay, what's the level of abstraction that you want to deal with these things in right now? It's like a question answer paradigm, so called chatbot. Ask question, get an answer, ask a question, get an answer. Well, you want that to go for sure to more of a fluid conversation. You want it to build up more knowledge of who you are, and you don't want to have to explain yourself the second time and so forth. And then you want to be able to tell it things like, well, remind me this, that, or be sure and tell me when x. But then maybe over time, more and more, you want it actually deciding to when it's going to talk to you, right. And when it thinks it has something to say, it says it.

So presumably these machines could learn my style of fragmented internal dialogue. And maybe I have an earpiece and I'm walking in, I start hearing something, but at some, you know, advice, et cetera, encouragement, discouragement. But at some point, those sounds that I hear in an earphone are very different than seeing something or hearing something in the room. We know this based on the neuroscience of musical perception and language perception. Hearing something in your head is very different. And I could imagine at some point that the AI will cross a precipice if it has inline wiring to actually control neural activity in specific brain areas. And I don't mean very precisely, even just stimulating a little more prefrontal cortical activity, for instance, through the earpiece, a little ultrasound wave now can stimulate prefrontal cortex in a non invasive way that's being used clinically and experimentally, that the AI could decide that I need to be a little bit more context aware. This is something that is very beneficial for those listening, that are trying to figure out how to navigate through life. It's like, know the context you're in, and know the catalog of behaviors and words that are appropriate for that situation and not others. And, you know, this would go along with agreeableness, perhaps, but strategic agreeableness, right. Context is important. There's nothing diabolical about that. Context is important, but I could imagine the AI recognizing we're entering a particular environment. I'm now actually going to ramp up activity in prefrontal cortex a little bit in a certain way that allows you to be more situationally aware of yourself and others, which is great, unless I can't necessarily short circuit that influence, because at some point, the AI is actually then controlling my brain activity and my decision making and my speech. I think that's what people fear, is that once we cross that precipice, that we are giving up control to the artificial versions of our human intelligence."

They're able to do things that increasingly are like the things that people can do in some circumstances. But these are machines. We build the machines, we decide how to use the machines. When we want the machines turned on, they're turned on, we want them turned off, they're turned off.

You know, inserting and deleting particular genes in adulthood. Right. Not having to recombine in the womb. A new organism is an immensely powerful tool. And yet the chinese scientists who did CRISPR on humans, this has been done. Actually, he did his postdoc at Stanford with Steve Quake, then went to China, did CRISPR on babies, mutated something. I believe it was the HIV, one of the HIV receptors. I'm told it was with the intention of augmenting human memory. It had very little to do, in fact, with limiting susceptibility to HIV per se, to do with the way that that receptor is involved in human memory. The world demonized that person. We actually don't know what happened to them. Whether or not they have a laboratory now or they're sitting in jail, it's unclear. But in China and elsewhere, people are doing crispr on humans. We know this. It's not legal in the US and other countries, but it's happening.

Yeah, nature. I mean, look, mutations, like, so this is the old. This is the old question of, like, basically state, you know, this is a state of nature, state of grace. Like, you know, basically, is nature good? And then therefore artificial things are bad, you know, which is kind of shot. A lot of people have, like, ethical views like that. I'm always of the view that, like, nature's a bitch and wants us dead. Like, nature's out to get us, man. Like, nature wants to kill us. Right? Like, nature wants to, like, evolve all kinds of like, horrible viruses. Nature wants to plagues, nature wants to, like, do weather, you know, like nature. Nature wants to do all kinds of stuff. I mean, look, the original nature religion was the original religion, right? Like, that was the original thing people worshiped. And the reason was because nature was the thing that was out to get you right before you had scientific and technological methods to be able to be able to deal with it. So, so the idea of not doing these things, to me is just saying, oh, we're just going to turn over the future of everything to nature. I don't think that, that there's no reason to believe that that leads in a particularly good direction or bad. You know, that's not a value neutral decision. And then the related thing that comes from that is this always this question around what's called the precautionary principle, which shows up in all these conversations on things like CRISPR, which basically is this. It's this principle that basically says the inventors of a new technology should be required to prove that it will not have negative effects before they roll it out. This, of course, is a very new idea. This is actually a new idea. In the 1970s, it was actually invented by the German Greens. The 1970s. Before that, people didn't think in those terms. People just invented things and rolled them out. And we got all of modern civilization by people inventing things and rolling them out. The German Greens came up with the precautionary principle for one specific purpose. I'll bet you can guess what it is. It was to prevent famine, nuclear power. It was to shut down attempts to do civilian nuclear power. And if you fast forward 50 years later, you're like, wow. Wow. That was a big mistake. What they said at the time was, you have to prove that nuclear reactors are not going to melt down and cause all kinds of problems. And of course, as an engineer, can you prove that that will never happen? You cant. You cant rule out things that might happen in the future. And so that philosophy was used to stop nuclear power, by the way, not just in Europe, but also in the US and around much of the rest of the world. If youre somebody whos concerned about carbon emissions, of course, this is the worst thing that happened in the last 50 years. Years in terms of energy. We actually have the silver bullet answer to unlimited energy. With zero carbon emissions nuclear power. We choose not to do it. Not only do we choose not to do it, we're actually shutting down the plants that we have now in California. We just shut down the big plant, Germany just shut down their plants. Germany's in the middle of an energy war with Russia that, we are informed is existential for the future of Europe."

And there's a whole conversation to be had, by the way, about that, because there's different views you could have on that. And then it was in the fifties and sixties where they started to roll out civilian nuclear power. And then there were exits. There was, like, three Mile island melted down, and then Chernobyl melted down in the Soviet Union, and then even recently, Fukushima melted down. And so there have been meltdowns.

So one is he defined in 1971 something called Project Independence, which was to create 1000 new state of the art nuclear plants, civilian nuclear plants, in the US by 1980. And to get the US completely off of oil and cut the entire us energy grid over to nuclear power, electricity, cut over to electric cars, the whole thing, like, detached from carbonous. You'll notice that didn't happen. Why did that not happen? Because he also created the EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which then prevented that from happening.

And then, of course, what happens? Okay, so then here's the other kicker of what happens, right? Which is they won't do nuclear, but they want to do renewables, right? Sustainable energy. And so what they do is they do solar and wind. Solar and wind are not reliable because it sometimes gets dark out and sometimes the wind doesn't blow.

And this is, you know, misinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, like, all that stuff, which I don't think is a real. Is a. Is actually a real problem. And then there's a. But people have a bunch of economic concerns around, you know, what's gonna take all the jobs and all those kinds of things. We could talk about that. I don't think those are. Those are. Those are. I don't think that's actually the thing that happens. But then there are two actual real concerns that I actually do very much agree with. And one of them is what you said, which is bad people doing bad things. And there's a whole set of things to be done inside there. The big one is we should use AI to build defenses against all the bad things. For example, there's a concern AI is going to make it easier for bad people to build pathogens, design pathogens in labs, which bad scientists can do today, but this is going to make it easier. Easier to do. Well, obviously, we should have the equivalent of an operation, warp speed, operating in perpetuity anyway. But then we should use AI to build much better bio defenses. And we should be using AI today to design, like, for example, full spectrum vaccines against every possible form of pathogen. So, defensive mechanism hacking, you can use AI to build better defense tools. And so you should have a whole new kind of security suite wrapped around you, wrapped I around your data, wrapped around your money, where you're having AI repel attacks, disinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, all that stuff. You should have an AI filter when you use the Internet, where you shouldn't have to figure out whether it's really me or whether it's a made up thing, you should have an AI assistant that's doing that for you."

And I don't want to hear from these other people who I don't like, by the way, it's going to be, my eight year old is using this. I don't want anything that's going to cause a problem. And I want everything filtered and AI based filters like that that you program and control are going to work much better and be much more honest and straightforward and clear and so forth than what we have today anyway. So basically what I want people to do is think, every time you think of a risk of how it can be used, just think of like, okay, we can use it to build a countermeasure. And the great thing about the countermeasures is they can not only offset AI risks, they can offset other risks, right? Because we already live in a world where pathogens are a problem, right? We ought to have better vaccines anyway. We already live in a world where there's cyber hacking and cyber terrorism. They already live in a world where there is bad content on the Internet.

And then, of course, they are going to spread their technology and their vision of how society should run across the world. So we're back in a cold war dynamic like we were with the Soviet Union, where there are two different systems that have fundamentally different views on concepts like freedom and individual choice and freedom of speech and so on. And we know where the Chinese stand and we're still figuring out where we stand.

It's evolution in action, if you think about it, is if there's no external threat, then the conflict turns inward, and then at that point, there's a big fight between, specifically tech. And then I was just generally politics. And my interpretation of that fight is it's a fight for status. It's fundamentally a fight for status and for power, which is like, if you're in politics, you like the status quo of how power and status work in our society. You don't want these new technologies to show up and change things because change is bad, right? Change threatens your position. It threatens the respect that people have for you and your control over things. So I think it's primarily a status fight, which we could talk about, but the China thing is just a straight up geopolitical us versus them. Like I said, it's a cold war scenario. And look, 20 years ago, the prevailing view in Washington was, we need to be friends with China and we're going to be trading partners with China. And yes, they're a totalitarian dictatorship, but if we trade with them, over time, they'll become more democratic. In the last five to ten years, it's become more and more clear that that's just not true.

It's not even owned by the state. It's owned by the party. It's owned by the Chinese Communist Party. So the Chinese Communist Party owns everything and they control everything. By the way, it's actually illegal to this day. It's illegal for an investor to buy equity in a chinese company. There's all these basically legal machinations that people do to try to do something that's economic equivalent to that, but it's actually still illegal to do that. The Chinese have no intention, the chinese communist party has no intention of letting foreigners own any of China. China like, zero intention of that.

When the party says you change the algorithm to optimize to a certain social result, you say yes. So it's whatever Xi Jinping and his party cadres decide, and that's what gets implemented. If you're the CEO of a chinese tech company, there is a political officer assigned to you who has an office down the hall.

And whether or not they succeeded in that isn't clear. Those babies are alive and presumably by now, walking, talking. As far as I know, whether or not they have super memories isn't clear. But China is clearly unafraid to augment biology in that way. And I believe that that's inevitable, that it's going to happen elsewhere, probably first for the treatment of disease. But at some point, I'm assuming people are going to augment biology to make smarter kids. I mean, people not always, but often will select make based on the traits they would like their children to inherit. So this happens far more frequently than could be deemed bad because either that or people are bad, because people do this all the time. Selecting mates that have physical and psychological and cognitive traits that you would like your offspring to have. CRISPR is a more targeted approach. Of course, the reason I'm giving this example and examples like it is that I feel like so much of the way that governments and the public react to technologies is to just take that first glimpse. And it just feels scary. You think about the old Apple ad, of the 1984 Ad. There was one very scary version of the personal computer and computers and robots taking over and everyone like automatons. And then there was the Apple version where it's all about creativity, love and peace. And it had this pseudo psychedelic California thing going for it. Again, great marketing seems to convert people's thinking about technology such that what was once viewed as very scary and dangerous and dystopian is like an oasis of opportunity. So why are people so afraid of new technologies?"

        "text": "So this is the thing I've tried to understand for a long time, because the history is so clear, and the history basically is. Every new technology is greeted by what's called a moral panic. And so it's basically this, like, historical freak out of. Of some kind that causes people to basically predict the end of the world. And you go back in time and actually, this historical sort of effect, it happens even in things now where you just look back and it's ludicrous. Right. And so you mentioned earlier the satanic panic of the eighties and the concern around, like, heavy metal music. Right. Before that, there was like a freak out around comic books, you know, in the fifties, there was a freak out around jazz music. In the twenties and thirties, you know, it's devil music, you know, there was a freak out. The arrival of bicycles caused a moral panic in the, like, 1860s. 18 six bicycles. Bicycles. Yeah. So there was this thing at the time. So bicycles were the first. They were the first very easy to use personal transportation thing that basically let kids travel between towns, you know, quickly, without any overhead. You know, you have to take care of a horse, just jump on a bike and go. And so there was a historical panic specifically around at the time, young women who for the first time, were able to venture outside the confines of the town to maybe go have a boyfriend in another town. And so the magazines at the time ran all these stories on this phenomenon, medical phenomenon, called bicycle face. And the idea of bicycle face was the exertion caused by pedaling a bicycle would cause your face. Your face would grimace. And then if you were on the bicycle for too long, your face would lock into place. Right, sorry. I was just saying you would be unattractive and therefore, of course, unable to then, you know, get married. Cars. There was a moral panic around car red flag laws. There were all these laws that created the automobile. Automobile freaked people out. So there are all these laws. In the early days of the automobile, in a lot of places, you would take a ride in automobile and automobiles, they broke down all the time. So it would be only rich people had automobiles. It would be you and your mechanic in the car for when it broke down. And then you had to hire another guy to walk 200 yards in front of the car with a red flag, and he had to wave the red flag, and so you could only drive as fast as he could walk as the red flag was to warn people that the. The car was coming. And then. And then in, I think it was Pennsylvania, they had the most draconian version, which was they were very worried about the car scaring the horses. And so there was a law that said if you saw a horse coming, you need to stop the car. You had to disassemble the car, and you had to hide the pieces of the car behind the nearest hay bale, wait for the horse to go by, and then you could put your car back together. So anyways, this example is electric lighting. There was a panic around, like, whether this is going to completely ruin, you know, this is going to completely ruin, like, the romance of the dark. And it was going to cause, you know, you know, a whole new kind of, like, terrible civilization where everything is always brightly lit. So there's just, like, all these examples. And so it's like, okay, what on earth is happening? That this is always what happens? And so I finally found this book that I think has a good model for it. The book is called men machines in modern times. And it's written by this MIT professor, like, 60 years ago. So it predates the Internet, but it uses a lot of historical examples. And what he says, basically, is, he says there's actually a three stage response. There's a three stage societal response to new technologies. It's very predictable. He said, stage one is basically just denial. Just ignore. We just don't pay attention to this. Nobody takes it seriously. There's just a blackout on the whole topic. He says, that's stage one. Stage two is rational counterargument. So stage two is where you line up all the different reasons why this can't possibly work. It can't possibly ever get, you know, cheap or, you know, this, that. Not fast enough, or whatever the thing is. And then he says, stage three, he says, is when the name calling begins. So he said, stage three is like, when? Right, right. So when they fail to ignore it and they fail to argue society out of it, I love it. They move to the name calling. Right, and what's the name calling? The name calling is, this is evil. This is moral panic. This is evil. This is terrible. This is awful. This is going to destroy it, everything. Like, don't you understand? Like, you know, all this, you know, it's just like, this is horrifying. And you, the person working on it are being reckless and evil and, you know, all this stuff, and you must be stopped. And he said the reason for that is because basically, fundamentally, what these things are is they're a war over status. It's a war over status, and therefore a war over power. And then, of course, ultimately money. But human status is the thing. And so, because what he says is, what is the societal impact of an technology? The societal impact of a new technology is at reorder status in the society. So the people who are specialists in that technology become high status, and the people who are specialists in the previous way of doing things become low status. And generally, people don't adapt. Right. Generally, if you're the kind of person who is high status because you're an evolved adaptation to an existing technology, you're probably not the kind of person that's going to enthusiastically try to replant yourself onto a new technology. And so this is like every politician who's just, like, in a complete state of panic about social media. Like, why are they so freaked out about social media? Is because they all know that the whole nature of modern politics has changed. The entire battery of techniques that you used to get elected before social media are now obsolete. Obviously, the best new politicians of the future are going to be 100% creations."

And like, here's how you, like, do things, and here's how you give speeches, and here's the clothes you wear and the tie and the thing in the pocket square.

And then it all of a sudden started to work dramatically well, like seemingly overnight. And so it went from basically, as far as most people were concerned, it went from it doesn't work at all to it works incredibly well in one step, and that almost never happens. And so, and so I actually think that's exactly what's happening. I think it's actually speed running this progression just, just because if you use mid journey or you use GPT or any of these things for five minutes, you're just like, wow. Like, obviously this thing is going to be like, obviously in my life, this is going to be the best thing ever. Like, this is amazing. There's all these ways that I can use it.

        "text": "Name calling in the face of all this, there are innovators out there. Maybe they are aware they are innovators. Maybe they are already starting companies, or maybe they are just some young or older person who has these five traits in abundance or doesn't, but know somebody who does and is partnering with them in some sort of idea. And you have an amazing track record at identifying these people. I think in part because you have those same traits yourself. I've heard you say the following. The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. That's a remarkable quote, because it says at least two things to me. One is that you have a very clear understanding of the inner workings of these great innovators. We talked a little bit about that earlier, these five traits, etcetera, but that also you have an intense understanding of the world landscape. And the way that we've been talking about it for the last hour or so is that it is a really intense and kind of oppressive landscape. You've got countries and organizations and elites and journalists that are trying to, not necessarily trying, but are suppressing the innovation process. I mean, that's sort of the picture that I'm getting. So it's like we're trying to innovate inside of a vice that's getting progressively tighter. And yet this quote argues that it is the person, boy or girl, man or woman, who says, well, you know what? That all might be true, but my view of the world is the way the world's gonna bend, or I'm gonna create a dent in that vice that allows me to exist the way that I want, or you know what? I'm actually gonna uncurl the vice the other direction. And so I'm at once picking up a sort of pessimistic, glass half empty view of the world, as well as a glass half full view. So tell me about that. Tell us about that from the perspective of someone listening who is thinking, I've got an idea. And I know it's a really good one, because I just know I might not have the confidence of extrinsic reward yet, but I just know there's a seed of something. What does it take to foster that? And how do we foster real innovation in the landscape that we're talking about?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So part is, I think you just, I think one of the ways to square it is, I think you as the innovator, need to be signed up to fight the fight. Right? So, and again, this is where, like, the fictional portrayals of startups, I think, take people off course, or even scientists or whatever, because they, when there's great success stories, they get kind of prettified after the fact, and they may get made to be, like, cute and fun, and it's like, yeah, no, like, if you talk to anybody who actually did any of these things, like, no, there was, it was just like, these things are always just like brutal exercises and just like sheer willpower and fighting, you know, fighting, fighting forces that are trying to get you. So part of it is you just, you have to be signed up for the fight. And this kind of goes to the conscientiousness thing we're talking about. We also, my partner Ben uses the term courage a lot, right? Which is some combination of, like, just stubbornness, but coupled with, like, a willingness to take pain and not stop and, you know, have people think very bad things of you for a long time until it turns out, you know, you hopefully prove yourself, prove yourself correct. And so you have to be willing to do that. Like, it's a, these are, it's a context sport. Like, it's, these aren't easy roads, right? It's a context sport. So you have to be signed up for the fight. The advantage that you have as an innovator is that is, at the end of the day, the truth actually matters. And all the arguments in the world, the classic Victor Hugo quote is there's nothing more powerful in the world than idea whose time has come, right? Like, if, if it's real, right? And this is just pure substance. If the thing is real, if the idea is real, like, if it's a legitimately good scientific discovery and, you know about how the nature works, if it's a new invention, if it's a new work of art, and if it's real, you know, then you do. At the end of the day, you have that on your side. And all of the people who are fighting you and arguing with you and telling you, no, they're the have that on their side, right? It's not like they're showing up with some other thing and they're like, my thing is better than your thing. Like, that's not the main problem, right? The main problem is like, I have a thing. I'm convinced everybody else is telling me it's stupid, wrong, it should be illegal, whatever the thing is. But at the end of the day, I still have the thing, right? And so at the end of the day, like, yeah, the truth really matters. The substance really matters. If it's real, it's real. I'll give you an example. It's really hard historically to find an example of a new technology that came into the world that was then pulled back. And nuclear is maybe an example of that. But even still, there are still nuclear plants like running today that still exists. I would say the same thing as scientific. At least you this. I don't know of any scientific discovery that was made. And then people like, I know there are areas of science that are not politically correct to talk about today, but every scientist knows the truth. Truth. The truth is still the truth. I mean, even the geneticists in the Soviet Union who were forced to buy into Lysenkoism, like, knew the whole time that it was wrong. That I'm completely convinced of."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, they couldn't delude themselves, especially because the basic training that one gets in any field establishes some core truths upon which even the crazy ideas have to rest. And if they don't, as you pointed out, things fall to pieces. I would say that even the technologies that did not pan out and in some cases were disastrous, but that were great ideas at the beginning are starting to pan out. So the example I'll give is that most people are aware of the Elizabeth Holmes Theranos debacle, to put it lightly analyzing what's in a single drop of blood as a way to analyze hormones and disease and antibodies, et cetera. That's a great idea. It's a terrific idea. As opposed to having a phlebotomist come to your house, or you have to go in and you get tapped with and the pulling vials and the whole thing. There's now a company born out of Stanford that is doing exactly what she sought to do, except that at least the courts ruled that she fudged the thing, and that's why she's in jail right now. But the idea of getting a wide array of markers from a single drop of blood is an absolutely spectacular idea. The biggest challenge that company is going to confront is the idea that it's just the next theranos. But if they've got the thing and they're not fudging it, as apparently Theranos was, I think everything will work out. A la Victor Hugo."

        "text": "Well, this is why I think people who need to be loved probably stand a reduced chance of success. And maybe that's also why having people close to you that do love you and allowing that to be sufficient can be very beneficial. This gets back to the idea of partnership and family around innovators, because if you feel filled up by those people local to you in your home, then you don't need people on the Internet saying nice things about you or your ideas because you're good and you can forge forward. Another question about innovation is the teams that you assemble around you, and you've talked before about this small squadron model. David and Goliath examples as well, where a small group of individuals can create a technology that frankly outdoes what a giant like Facebook might be doing or what any other large company might be doing. There are a lot of theories as to why that would happen, but I know you have some unique theories. Why do you think small groups can defeat large organizations?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "The conventional explanation is, I think, correct. And it's just that large organizations have a lot of advantages, but they just have a very hard time actually executing anything because of all the overhead. So large organizations have combinatorial communication overhead. Right. The number of people who have to be consulted, who have to agree on things gets to be staggering. The amount of time it takes to schedule the meeting gets to be staggering. You get these really big companies and they have some issue they're dealing with, and it takes like a month to schedule the pre meeting to plan for the meeting, which is going to happen two months later, which is then going to result in a post meeting, which will then result in a board presentation, which will then result in a planning offsite."

I mean, look, you'd have these organizations at 100,000 people are more like you're. You're more of a nation state than a, than a, than a, than a company. And you've got all these competing internal. You know, it's the Bedouin thing, I think, before you've got all these internal. Like, at most big companies, your internal enemies are, like, way more dangerous to you than anybody on the outside."
    },

        "text": "Can you elaborate on that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Oh, yeah. Yeah. Your big competition, the big company. At a big company, the big competition is for. For the next promotion. And the enemy for the next promotion is the next executive over in your company. That's your enemy. The competitor on the outside is like an abstraction. Maybe they'll matter someday. Whatever. I got to beat that guy inside my own company. And so the internal warfare is at least as intense as the external warfare and so, yeah, so it's just, I mean this is just all the iron law of all these big bureaucracies and how they function. So if a bureaucracy ever does anything productive, I think it's like a miracle. Like, it's like a miracle to the point where there should be like a celebration, there should be parties, there should be like dick or tape parades for like big, large organizations that actually do things like that. That's great because it's like, so, it's so rare. It doesn't happen very often. So anyway, so that's the conventional explanation. Whereas look, small, small companies, small teams, you know, there's a lot that they can't do because they can't, they're not operating at scale and they don't have global coverage and all these kind of, you know, they don't have the resources and so forth, but at least they can move quickly, they can organize fast, they can have, if there's an issue today, they can have a meeting today, they can solve the issue today. And everybody they need to solve the issue is in the room today. So they can just move a lot faster. I think that's part of it. But I think there's another deeper thing underneath that that people really don't like to talk about. That takes us back full circle to where we started, which is just the sheer number of people in the world who are capable of doing new things is just a very small set of people. And so you're not going to have 100 of them in a company or 1000 or 10,000. You're going to have three, eight or ten maybe."

        "text": "Some of them are blowing themselves up, some of them are IBM. I actually first learned this, my first actual job job was at IBM when IBM was still on top of the world right before it caved in in the early nineties. And so when I was there, it was 440,000 employees, which, and again, if you inflation adjust like today for that same size of business, inflation adjusted, market adjusted, it would be it's equivalent today of like a two or 3 million person organization. It was like a, it was a nation state. There were 6000 people in my division. You know, we were next door to another building that had another 6000 people in another division. So you just, you could work there for years and never meet anybody who didn't work for IBM. The first half of every meeting was just ibmers introducing themselves to each other. Like it was just mind boggling and the level of complexity. But they were so powerful that they had four years before I got there in 1985, they were 80% of market capitalization of the entire tech industry. So they were at a level of dominance that even Google or Apple today is not even close to at the time. So that's how powerful they were. And so they had a system and it worked really well for like 50 years. They had a system which was. Most of the employees in the company were expected to basically follow rules. So they dressed the same, they acted the same. They did everything out of the playbook. They were trained very specifically, but they had this category of people they called Wildenhouse Ducks. And this was an idea that the founder, Thomas Watson, came up with, wild ducks. And the wild ducks were, they often had the formal title of an IBM fellow, and they were the people who could make new things. And there were eight of them. And they got to break all the rules and they got to invent new products. They got to go off and work on something new. They didn't have to report back. They got to pull people off of other projects to work with them. They got budget when they needed it. They reported directly to the CEO. They got whatever they needed. He supported them in doing it. And they were glass breakers. And, you know, they showed, the one in Austin at the time was this guy Andy Heller. And he would show up in, you know, jeans and cowboy boots and, you know, amongst an ocean of men in, you know, blue suits, white shirts, red ties and put his cowboy boots up on the table. And it was fine for Andy Heller to do that. And it was not fine for you to do that, right? And so they very specifically identified. We haven't, we haven't. We have like a, like almost like an aristocracy, aristocratic class within our company that gets to play by different rules. Now the expectation is they deliver. Their job is to invent the next breakthrough product. But we, IBM management, know that the 6000 person division is not going to invent the next product. We know it's going to be crazy Andy Heller and his cowboy boots. And so I was always very impressed. And again, ultimately, IBM had its issues, but that model worked for 50 years, worked incredibly well. And I think that's basically the model that works. But it's a paradox, right? Which is like, how do you have a large bureaucratic, regimented organization, whether it's academia or government or business or anything, that has all these rule followers in it and all these people who are jealous of their status and don't want things to change but then still have that spark of creativity. I would say mostly it's impossible. Mostly it just doesn't happen. Those people get driven out. Right. And in tech, what happens is those people get driven out because we will fund them. These are the people we fund. Right."

        "text": "The wild ducks. That's exactly right. And actually, this is actually close the loop. This is actually, I think, the simplest explanation for why IBM ultimately caved in. And then HP sort of, in the eighties also came, IBM and HP kind of were model. There were these incredible, monolithic, incredible companies for 40 or 50 years, and then they kind of both caved in in the eighties and nineties. And I actually think it was the emergence of capital. It was the emergence of a parallel funding system where the wild ducks, or in HP's case, their superstar technical people, could actually leave and start their own companies. And again, it goes back to the university discussion we're having is like, this is what doesn't exist at the university level. This certainly does not exist at the government level."
