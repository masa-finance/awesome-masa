        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Lane Norton. Doctor Norton is one of the foremost experts in protein metabolism, fat loss and nutrition. He did his degrees in biochemistry and nutritional sciences and is considered one of the world experts in understanding how we extract energy from our food and how exercise and what we eat combine to impact things like body composition and overall health. Today we discuss an enormous number of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness, including, for instance, what is energy balance? That is, how do we actually extract energy from our food? We also discuss the somewhat controversial topic of artificial sweeteners, whether or not they are safe or not, and whether or not they are an effective tool for weight loss, in particular for people suffering from obesity and different types of diethyde. We also talk about gut health, that is the gut microbiome, and how it's impacted by food and how it can actually impact the metabolism of the foods that we eat. We also discuss fasting, or so called intermittent fasting or time restricted feeding. What it does and what it does not do, in terms of how effective it is for weight loss, and perhaps even for health and longevity. We also talk about protein and define very clearly how much protein each and all of us need, depending on our daily activities and life demands. We discussed the various types of diets that you've probably heard about, including ketogenic diets, vegan diets, vegetarian diets, and pure carnivore diets, as well as more typical omnivore diets, and how to make sure that you get all of the essential amino acids that are critical for healthy weight maintenance, weight loss, or directed muscle gain. We also talk about supplements, in particular the supplements for which there is an immense amount of science pointing to their safety and efficacy for fitness and for overall body composition. What I'm sure will become clear to you as you hear Lane talk about each and every one of these topics, is that he has an incredible ability to both understand the mechanistic science, but also the real world applications of the various discoveries that are made in particular papers, and in particular in the randomized controlled trials. That is when a given scientific hypothesis has been raised. He's extremely good at understanding why it was raised, but also at evaluating whether or not it works in the real world, which is what I believe most everybody out there is concerned with. I think this is one of the things that really distinguishes him from the other voices in the nutritional landscape. I assure you that by the end of today's discussion, you will have a much clearer understanding about what the science says about nutrition, about fitness, and about how different diets and fitness programs combine to achieve the results that you want. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com hubermandhe. Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, NidRa sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with Doctor Lane Norton. Lane Doctor Norton, thank you so much for being here. This is a long time coming and I have to say I'm really excited because I've seen you in the social media sphere. I've also listened to a number of your other podcasts, and as a fellow PhD scientist, I feel a great kinship with you. I know you have tremendous experience in fitness and nutrition, a number of areas. We also got a lot of questions from our audience and I'm really looking forward to talking with you today."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, indeed. And I think some of the audience has requested a debate or a battle, and I can tell you right now it's not going to happen. Actually, one of the things that brought Lane and I together in conversation online and then via text, et cetera, was the fact that I love to be corrected. And that's what happened. I did a post about artificial sweeteners, which we will talk about a little bit later in the episode, and Lane pointed out some areas of the study that I had missed or maybe even misunderstood, and I revised my opinions and I think it's wonderful. And other studies have come out since then. So hopefully our conversation will serve as a message of how science and actionable science can be perceived and that it doesn't always have to be a battle. But hey, if we get into it, we get into it, it won't get physical, because we know you would win. In any case, I'd like to start with something that's rather basic and yet can be pretty complex. And that's this issue of energy balance and energy utilization. I think most people have heard of a calorie. I'm assuming that most people don't actually know what that is in terms of how it works, what it represents. And so maybe you could just explain for people what happens when we eat food of any kind. And how is that actually converted into energy as a way of framing up the discussion around weight loss, weight maintenance, weight gain, and body composition."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "This is a great question. And like you said, this is one of those things where people use the term calories in, calories out, and they say, well, that's way too simplistic. And I'm like, if you look at what actually makes up calories in, calories out, it's actually very complicated. Right? So let's deal with what you mentioned first. What is a calorie? Because I think a lot of people don't quite understand this. So a calorie just refers to a unit of energy, of heat, specifically. And so what does that have to do with food? What does that have to do with, like, what we digest and eat? Really, what you're talking about is the potential chemical energy that is in the bonds of the macronutrients of food, right? And by digesting, assimilating, and metabolizing those nutrients, we are able to create energy. And the end product of that mostly is ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is your body's energy currency. So to understand ATP, just try to think about if you're trying to power these various reactions in your body, and we're talking about tens of thousands of enzymes that require ATP, it doesn't make sense that you would have to create a bunch of micro explosions, right? You want something that can transfer high energy phosphates to power these reactions, to give up, essentially its energy to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable. So a lot of metabolism is simply creating ATP, which the end of the line of that I'm going to kind of work backwards is what's called oxidative respiration. So that happens in the mitochondria. Everybody's heard mitochondria, powerhouse of the cell. And that is done through essentially creating a hydrogen ion gradient across the mitochondria which powers the production of ATP by converting free phosphate plus adp to ATP. Now, the way that hydrogen ion gradient is created is through, you know, creating hydrogen ions that can be donated through the Krebs cycle. Now, the Krebs cycle is linked to glycolysis. So if we talk about carbohydrate metabolism, carbohydrates, basically other than fructose, get converted into glucose, which can go into glycolysis. And you can produce some atps through glycolysis. And then it boils down to pyruvate. Then acetyl CoA, which goes through the Krebs cycle, produces a lot more atps from that. If you talk about protein, protein is a little bit different because protein gets converted to amino acids, which can be used for muscle protein synthesis or protein synthesis in other tissues, but it also can be converted through gluconeogenesis to glucose. And there also are some ketogenic amino acids as well. And so you can have a few different ways to get to the Krebs cycle, either being through acetyl CoA or through glucose going through the glycolysis to pyruvate. Then you have fatty acids, which are able to create energy through what's called beta oxidation, where essentially you're taking these fatty acids and you're lopping them off two carbons at a time to produce acetyl coa, which, again, can go into the Krebs cycle, produce those hydrogen ions that can then power the production of ATPDez. So that's kind of like at the cellular level of how this stuff works. But stepping back and taking it back out, like, what does that have to do with weight loss or weight gain? Right. Well, when you think about the balance of energy in versus energy out, sounds very simple, but let's look at what actually makes up energy in versus energy out. First of all, you've got to realize that the energy inside of the equation is more difficult to track than people think. Right. So one food labels, which we like to think is being from upon high, can have up to a 20% error in them."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So 100 calorie, if something listed as 100 calories per serving, it could. What's actually in there could be 80 or 120."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right, exactly. So that's one aspect of it. The second aspect is there's what's called your energy, but then there's also metabolizable energy. Right. So if you have food stuff with, say, a lot of insoluble fiber, typically, insoluble fiber is not really digestible and so you could have, you know, quite a bit of carbohydrate, you know, but if you can't extract the energy from it, and typically, this is because insoluble fiber from, like, plant material, the carbohydrate, or, and even some of the protein is bound up in the plant structure, which makes it inaccessible to digestive enzymes. And so this is what, like, adds bulk to your stool and whatnot, but, again, reduces the metabolizable energy in there. And there's some evidence that, based on people's individual gut microbiome, that some people may actually be better at extracting energy out of fiber compared to other people. So just starting off right there. Okay, there's, there's quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things. Now, one of the things people will say is, well, see, that's why you shouldn't worry about tracking calories, because, you know, if the food label is going to be 20% off, and what I'll say is, okay, that's a, that's. I understand where you're coming from, but typically, if it's off, it's going to be consistently off. And if you're consistent with how you track it, eventually you'll be able to know kind of what you're taking in. And it's kind of, that's kind of like saying, well, don't worry about tracking. I like to use financial examples. We know that to save money or you have to earn more money than you spend, well, you can't exactly know how much money you're earning at a time because there's inflation. And then if you have investments, those can be different interest rates and whatnot. It's like, okay, but if you have a budget, you have a reasonable idea of what it's going to be, and you make. You make certain assumptions, but you can relatively guess."

        "text": "Yeah, that's a good example."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So now let's look at the energy outside of the equation, which is actually way more complicated. Right? And so your energy out is a few different buckets. The first one and the biggest one is your resting metabolic rate. So your RMR. And that, for most people, is anywhere from 50% to 70% of your total daily energy expenditure. Now, people use the term metabolic rate and energy expenditure kind of interchangeably, but they're not the same thing. So your total daily energy expenditure is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Walking upstairs, exercise, if you do it, fidgeting. Plus your resting metabolic rate."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So resting metabolic rate is a big part of that, but it's not the only thing. So that's usually about 50% to 70%. And sedentary people will be on the higher end of that, so it'll be a bigger proportion, whereas people who are more active, it'll be a little bit lower, not because their metabolic rate is lower, but because they're expending a greater percentage of their calories from physical activity. Then you have something called the thermic effect of food, which is a relatively small percentage of your total daily energy expenditure. It's about five to 10% and very difficult to measure. And usually what researchers do when they're kind of looking at this stuff is they just kind of make an assumption about it. They use a constant, but that's about five to 10% of your daily energy expenditure. And that refers to the amount of energy it takes to extract the energy out of food. So think about your body. Kind of like a car, right? You don't just have gas in your tank and it spontaneously starts up, right? Like you have to have a battery. So you put in energy so you can get the energy out of the petrol that you have in your car. Similar with food. You can't just eat food and then it just appears in your cells and you start doing stuff. It has to be systematically broken down and put into forms that can actually produce energy. And so you have to put some energy in to achieve that. And a lot of times people will say something like, well, not all calories are created equal. That's not true, because calories, just a unit of measurement, right? That would be like saying not all seconds on a clock are created equal. Yes, they are. All sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So if we look at something like fat, for example, the TEF of fat is about zero to 3%, meaning if you eat 100 calories from fat, your net will be about 97 to 100."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So the process of breaking down that fat essentially subtracts some of the calories away because you used it in creating energy by breaking those chemical bonds to create ATP."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Correct. So you have, like, for example, some enzymes that require ATP to run these processes. Now, fat is actually the easiest thing to convert into energy. Then you have carbohydrate, which has a Tef of like five to 10%. So you eat 100 calories from carbohydrate. And obviously, like, the fiber content makes a big difference on this. But if you eat 100 calories, you'll net 90 to 95 protein is about a 20% to 30% teflo. So if you eat 100 calories from protein, you're only netting 70 to 80 now, you're still net. You know, people say, well, you can't eat too much protein. Well, you know, people will ask, well, can protein be stored as fat? The carbons from protein, it's unlikely it's going to wind up in adipose tissue. But if you're eating a lot of protein overall as part of a lot of calories, it does, it has to be oxidized and it can provide a calorie cushion for other things to be stored in fat. But protein itself does provide a net positive for calories, but less so than carbohydrate or fat and tends to be more satiating. So again, when people talk about, are all calories created equal? Yes, but all sources of calories may have differential effects on energy expenditure and appetite. So that's the Tef bucket and the BMR bucket. Then we go to physical activity. And physical activity is essentially two parts. There's exercise, which is kind of your purposeful movements. Like you go out for a walk, you do a training session, I mean, whatever, any purposeful activity. And then you have what's called neat, which is non exercise activity, thermogenesis, which I think is actually really cool."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it is. So it's. I was actually hanging out with somebody last night and I was noticing them, they were fidgeting their feet and their fingers, and I said, you know, have you always, like, been pretty lean? And they were like, yeah, I never really had a problem maintaining leanness. And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype, people think they have high bmr or, you know, they exercise a lot. And really what it seems to be is neat. They tend to, if they overeat, they just spontaneously increase their physical activity. Now, people get neat, confused. I've heard people say, well, I'm going to go out for a walk to get my neat up. That's not neat. Neat is not something you can consciously modify what you're doing there. If it's purposeful, it's exercise. So, for example, when I'm talking, if I'm waving around my hands, if I'm tapping my feet, if I'm whatever, that's neat, but trying to get yourself, well, I'm just going to tap my foot more. Well, now, if I'm consciously having to do this, then my focus, I mean, you know how the brain works very hard to do, you know, you don't really do two things at once. You kind of switch quickly between tasks. Right?"

But anyway, I'll have to go check and we'll measure your fidgeting about non exercise induced thermogenesis neat. My understanding of the old papers on this old being, I guess back to the mid nineties, is that the calorie burn from neat is actually pretty significant. We're not talking about 100 calories or 200 calories per day. We're talking about, in some cases, hundreds of thousand, excuse me, hundreds to maybe even close to 1000 calories per day.

        "text": "So I believe they had people overeat. And I think it was by like 1000 calories a day and I think for six weeks. And I mean, this is the metabolic ward. So they are, this is very tightly controlled. It's as tight as you get. And what was interesting is, of course, on average, people gained weight and gained fat mass, but some people gained more than expected. And there was one person in particular who only gained like just over half a kilo. Right. They should have gained like, I think it was something like three to four kilos was predicted. And what they found is this individual just spontaneously increased their physical activity. He didn't purposefully do it. It just happened. And I mean, anecdotally, I've seen people who are, again, very lean, even eat a meal, sit down and start sweating, you know, and be very fidgety. There was a natural bodybuilder back in the day named Jim Cordova, and this guy was just very lean all the time. And he was exactly that phenotype. You know, he would walk up a flight of stairs and all of a sudden he's sweating. Sit down, eat a meal. He's sweating. You know, he just. He's a furnace, just expending energy. And what's very interesting about neat is that seems to be the most modifiable. I mean, exercise is very modifiable because you can be intentional with that. But of BMR, TEF and neat, neat seems to be far more modifiable. So even a body weight reduction of 10%, they've observed a decrease in neat of almost 500 calories a day for a 10% reduction in body weight. Now, you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight. One, because you're just in a smaller body now, and so it takes less energy to locomote. But also there's what's called metabolic adaptation, which is a further reduction in your BMR than expected from the loss of body mass. And that's on average, usually around like 15%. But it does seem to be, there's new evidence coming out on the metabolic adaptation from bmR, and it seems to be a little bit of, um, kind of in the transition phases. So if you, if you start a diet within the first few weeks, you will have a reduction in BMR that then kind of just thereafter, any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose. And then, if you like, for example, finish a diet and move your calories to maintenance, um, within a few weeks, BMR kind of starts to come back up. There is still a small reduction, but I used to be somebody who thought the BMR, the metabolic adaptation, was a big reason why people stopped losing weight or plateaued. And now I think it's much more to do with neat."

I don't know if you've had a chance to look at this study and I'll send it to you. Maybe it'd be fun to do a kind of an online journal club about this at some point soon. But there's a study that came out at University of Houston recently, having people do. Now, this is a long period of time, 4 hours a day, of basically a soleus pushup, which is basically a heel raise, kind of a seated calf raise, with 1ft, not weighted. And then they looked at a bunch of things about glucose metabolism and glucose clearance and insulin levels, and they didn't conclude that people burned a ton of calories. But what they concluded was that blood sugar regulation improved greatly. And I think you know, there was a lot of excitement about this at some level, but based on everything you're telling me, this fits perfectly with what's known about neat. So this sort of fell somewhere in between with in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise and spontaneous movement. I guess they've tried to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Can I ask one? Sorry to intro, but one quick question about that. When you say, go to the bathroom, not to get too detailed here, for unnecessarily, but are you talking about urination and emptying your bowels, ideally because you eat a big meal the night before? Yeah, got it. So wake up, use the bathroom in all forms that you're ready, and then get on the scale, take that measurement, average that across the week, and then maybe every Monday, you take that value and see progress."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And the reason I recommend doing that is if you're just kind of sporadically weighing in, as somebody who weighs themselves pretty regularly, I mean, my weight will fluctuate five, six pounds and not seemingly changing much. And that's just those short term changes are fluid. I've had it before where week to week, my average didn't change. But between the lowest weigh in from a previous week and the highest weigh in might have been like eight pounds. Right. So if you're somebody who just randomly is weighing in and you're eating in a calorie deficit, and you just weigh in one day where you just, whatever reason, holding some more fluid, then you, oh, see, this isn't working, when in reality, your average might be dropping. So that's one of the reasons. And actually, believe it or not, weight fluctuations are actually identified as a major reason why people get discouraged from weight loss, that it kind of stops the buy in when they have a fluctuation up. So that's one of the reasons. One of the reasons early on that low carb diets tend to work really well is because people lose a lot of water weight really quickly, and they get that buy in. Right. So. Oh, this is working."

And the fluid loss does hold that promise. I think fluid loss can do some other things that might. People literally make people literally feel lighter, although it can have some negative effects. I do have one quick question. And I do. We'll return to neat in a moment. But when you say the caloric burnt as a consequence of exercise, I want to ask about the caloric burn during that exercise. So, for instance, somebody is on the treadmill and they'll see, okay, they burn 400 calories. Actually, I think this is a month where a number of prominent podcasters like Burt Kreischer, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan, others are doing. They call it sober October. But in addition to avoiding alcohol, they're burning 500 calories per day during the exercise. They're measuring it. A lot of people do this. They think they take track of whether or, excuse me, take stock of how many calories they burned. My understanding is that if that particular form of exercise is a muscle building form of exercise, that at some point later there might be an increase in muscle. If you did everything right, do everything right, and then you will burn more energy as a consequence of adding that tissue. That's a long process, as you know, and we will discuss. But I have heard about this post exercise induced increase in oxidative metabolism. I'm probably not using the right language in here. So if I were to go out, for instance, and sprint, do some sprinting, run hard for a minute, jog for a minute, run hard for a minute, and do that ten times over, let's assume I burn 400 calories during that exercise bout. But my understanding is that in the hours that follow, my basal metabolic rate will have increased. Is that true? And is it significant enough to care about?"

So when they look at. And again, this is where I tell people, I think I have a good perspective on this, because my undergraduate degree was a biochemistry degree, so I was very into mechanisms, you know what I mean? It was like, oh, if we just do this and this, we'll get this right. And then I did nutrition as a graduate degree. And then my advisor was so great because you could do something over here and he could tell you how it would affect vitamin D metabolism over here."

So this is actually one of the things I changed my mind on was I used to be very much, well, I think high intensity interval training is probably better because you get this post exercise energy burn, which they do see in some of these studies, but in the kind of meta analyses and like more tightly controlled studies where they equate work between high intensity intervals and moderate or low intensity cardio, so, equating work, they don't see differences in the loss of body fat. And so to me, if I'm looking at that's the example of a mechanism which is, okay, we're seeing this small increase in basal metabolic rate that should lead to increased loss of body fat. But again, remember, you're capturing a snapshot in time, right? But we don't see a difference in the loss of body fat. So what may be happening? And again, I'm just speculating, but a way to explain it could be, you might have an increase, and then you might actually have a decrease. That tends to just kind of wash it out. Right."

So, for instance, if I go out for a 45 minutes jog, or which I do a 45 to 60 minutes hike or jog once a week, I just make it a point to do that or ruck or something like that, throw on a weight vest and hike. After that, I find I'm very thirsty. I want to hydrate, but I'm not that hungry. And that's true of most all cardiovascular exercise for me. But after I weight train about 60 to 90 minutes later, I want to eat the refrigerator. And so obviously, calories in, calories out dictates that that will play an important role as to whether or not I gain or lose weight, et cetera. So is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise that people choose needs to be taken in consideration of calories in, calories out? So how much is burned during the exercise? Also, how much that exercise tends to stimulate appetite? I don't know whether or not people explore this in the rigorous studies and whether or not that form of exercise actually increases lean muscle mass or not. So now we've taken exercise and split it into a number of different dimensions, but this is what you are so masterful at, is really parsing how the different components work individually and together.

Athletic greens, now called ag one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greenshouse while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera.

But if I go in tomorrow and I do 1300, it may not be accurate. I don't know what the exact number is, but I can be relatively confident that it's more than the previous session. Right. And so in terms of comparison, it might be okay, like, you know, kind of within subject. And then the other thing I was kind of circling around on was, if you're worried about neat tracking, your steps can be helpful because people's step counts can spontaneously decrease when they're on a fat loss diet. They don't even realize it. So, and that again, not a complete measure of neat, but what we've had some clients do with our team biling coaches is they'll say, okay, you're at 8000 steps right now. We're not going to add any purposeful cardio, but whatever you need to do to maintain that 8000 steps, do that. And sometimes they have to add, you know, 15, 2030 minutes of cardio because their spontaneous activity that they're not even aware of goes down."

So we're like eight hour intermittent fasting thing. There's a story behind that because I actually spoke to Sao Chin and it turns out that the graduate student in his lab that did that initial study, which was on mice, by the way, was limited to being in lab for about 8 hours by their significant other. So the eight hour feeding window is actually the consequence of this person's relationship."

And I'll tell people, like, listen, scientific studies are so confined. You need to be very careful with how broadly you apply what's in there, right? Like, they're a very big hammer is kind of the way I look at it. Okay, they're not a scalpel, they're a big hammer. And I think a lot of times in terms of coaching, scientific studies will tell you what not to do rather than what to do, right? But getting back to your question about like, exercise, appetite. So first off, I'm not really aware if there's evidence showing like differential effects of different forms of exercise on appetite. It's possible. But again, it also could be like a placebo effect, right? Because we, like, for example, you and I grew up in an era where the muscle magazines, it was like, well, as soon as you finish your workout, you got your biggest meal of the day, right? And, you know, when I say placebo effect, I think people have the wrong idea of what the placebo effect is. They think that's just a feeling. Placebo effect can actually change your physiology. People don't realize this. There's research showing that a placebo or the power of suggestion is basically as powerful as some pharmaceuticals. And one of the great examples I like to use is actually there was a study we just covered in our research review on creatine where they did four groups not supplemented with creatine, told they weren't supplemented with creatine. Not supplemented. Told they were supplemented, supplemented told they weren't supplemented, told they were. Basically, it just matters what they told them really. Oh yeah."

A colleague of mine at Stanford, she's been on the podcast I'd love to introduce you to because I think you guys really riffed. First of all, she was a former d one athlete and then runs a lab at Stanford in psychology. This is Leah Crumb and she's grew up in this very athletic, obviously, and very very smart. And her laboratory focuses on these belief placebo effects where if you tell people all the horrible things that stress do to you in terms of your memory and cognitive functioning and then you give them a memory test, they perform well below baseline. If you tell them that stress sharpens them in the short term and that adrenaline is this powerful molecule that can really tune up a number of memory systems, memory improves and it's remarkable and it's consistent. And they've done this for any number of different things, including food allergies, for instance. Incredible results. In any case, I'm so glad you're bringing this up. I take creatine monohydrate and I have for years 5 grams a day. I don't. That's great and it's great and I believe it's great. So is there a compound effect of believing it's great and it actually being great?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So not, not in this study, but so I think the thing to point out, people will misinterpret that as creatine doesn't work. And that's not what that says. What it says is your beliefs about what it does are probably just as powerful as what it does. Right. So they actually did a study and I don't have the citation, but it was, I think within the last ten years where they told people they were putting them on anabolic steroids. And wouldn't you know it, they had better gains. Even though they weren't actually on anabolic steroids, they had better gains than people that they didn't tell were anabolic steroids. And that's like hard outcomes, strength, lean body mass, you know, those sorts of things. So when people say, well, I wouldn't fall for the placebo effect, it's like, eh, you don't have to fall for it if you believe it to be true. The power of belief is very very powerful. And as a scientist I wish sometimes I was ignorant so that I could subject myself to the placebo effect more often. So kind of getting back to that's just a possible explanation of maybe why, you know, and I'm the same way. Like, I get done with a workout, like a resistance training session, I'm like, I'm ready to eat right now. If you look at the literature overall on exercise and appetite, it's not always what you'd expect consistently. It seems to show that exercise actually has an appetite suppressant effect. So people don't tend to compensate at least fully for the amount of movement they do. And there is some evidence that you've probably heard people say, well, exercise is a really poor weight loss tool. If you figure out how many calories you should be burning from it and you do that, you end up getting less weight loss than you. Than you would predict."

Not that those things don't necessarily work. We're not going through them in detail now, but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do for our health span and lifespan."

        "text": "Yeah, absolutely. I 100% agree. And when you're talking about weight loss, people miss the point of exercise. I think there's some work that came out from Herman Pontzer as well that basically showed like, well, if you do 100 calories from exercise, you have a 28 calorie reduction in your basal metabolic rate in response to that. So it's kind of like this constrained energy expenditure model. Right. But what I would say is, okay, well, there's still a net of 72, right? So it's still okay. And the other thing is, I think the effects of exercise on weight loss are actually more due to what it does to appetite. So if you look at people who lose weight and keep it off for a number of years, kind of outliers, because most people don't keep it off for years, over 70% of them engage in regular exercise. Of people who do not keep weight loss, like maintain weight loss, less than 30% exercise regularly. So now, that's just a correlation that doesn't necessarily prove causation. But there are some pretty compelling studies showing that exercise increases your sensitivity to satiety signals. So basically, you can have the same satiety signals, but you're more sensitive to them when you exercise. And there's actually a really classic study from the 1950s in Bengali workers where they looked at basically four different quadrants of activity. So you had sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, heavily active, basically based on their job choice. And they didn't have an intervention, they just wanted to track them and see how much, you know, how many calories did they actually eat? So it was like a j shaped curve. So the sedentary actually ate more food than the lightly active or moderately active. But from lightly active to heavily active, they almost perfectly compensated how many calories they should be eating. So to me, that suggests when you become active, you can actually regulate your appetite appropriately or much more appropriately than if you're sedentary."

And there's this kind of. And we'll get into this. When we talk about artificial sweeteners, there's this idea in mind I think I adopted, perhaps falsely, that, you know, you eat something that's sweet or that tastes really good and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more.

They can go together. But usually, like, the hypoglycemia is like, I am hot. I feel like I'm going to pass out.

So, again, when they look at actual randomized control trials of implementing some exercise where they're pretty controlled environment, they typically see people, if anything, they eat less as opposed to eating more. Now, some people, again, that's, you know, studies report averages, right. And there's individual data points. So there are some people who at least anecdotally report that exercise makes them more hungry. That's completely valid. It's. Now, it could be their beliefs around it. It could be a number of different things, but it's important to understand that there is individual variability. And I think one of the things that I've learned to appreciate more is not trying to separate psychology and physiology. We do this a lot and say, well, I want to know the physiology. I don't care about the psychology of it. And now I'm kind of appreciating more. Psychology is physiology with most things. Now we have kind of the biopsychosocial model, and I'll give you an example of this. A lot of people get really caught up with appetite, and if we could just suppress people's appetite, that's part of it. But people don't just eat cause they're hungry. They eat for a lot of different reasons, social reasons, especially. So can you remember the last social event you ever went to that didn't have food?"

And I'm like, I feel no need to try and convince them to do that with me. You know what I mean? But as humans, we're kind of herd animals. We don't want to be doing something out in isolation on our own. Now, this is a very tenuous, I guess, belief of mine, but doing things alone in isolation during kind of, you know, ancestral times, that's going to set off your alarm system, you know, because if you don't have other people, you can't protect yourself. Right? So typically, things were done together in groups. And I think that's a lot of the reason why we tend to be just tribal in nature about a lot of things. Right. So the whole point to that is, you know, on the list of reasons why people eat, I mean, I've gotten to the point where I think that hunger is actually not even the main reason people eat. A stress, lack of sleep, boredom. Boredom, absolutely. So unless we can do something that addresses all those things, there's a line from a review paper. This review paper came out in 2011 by a researcher named McLean, and it's the best review paper I've ever read. It was called biology's response to the impetus for weight regain and basically went through all the mechanisms of these adaptations that happened during fat loss diets, and how biology's response is to try to drive you back to your previous. And I'm going to butcher the quote, but at the end of the study, he said, basically, the body's systems are comprehensive, redundant, and well focused on restoring depleted energy reserves. And any attempt or any kind of strategy for weight loss that doesn't attempt to address a broad spectrum of these things is going to fail. And so that's why when people say, well, just do low carb, you won't be hungry. I'm like, yeah, but people don't just eat because they're hungry. So I think really like trying to get outside the box and think about these things, and especially when you read some of the literature. I recently read a systematic review of successful weight loss maintainers, which I thought was really interesting. So they took people who had lost a significant amount of body weight and kept it off for, I think it was three years, and they basically asked them questions and tried to identify commonalities. And there were some things that I expected, like cognitive restraint, self monitoring exercise. And then one of the things they said that I found really fascinating was pretty ubiquitous between people. They said I had to develop a new identity. So are you familiar with Ethan Suplee?"

Because I had to kill who I was because there was no way I was gonna be able to make long term changes if I just didn't become a new person. Because there's. I mean, and addicts talk about this, right? Like, people who were alcoholics, they had to get new friends. They had to hang out at different places because their entire life had been set up around this lifestyle for alcohol. And I would actually argue that eating disorders or disordered eating patterns is much harder to break than other forms of addiction. And you think about food addiction? Well, in some ways, bulimia and anorexia are still addictions. You can't stop eating. Like, if you're alcoholic, you can abstain from alcohol. If you become addicted to, say, cocaine, you can abstain from that. You can never abstain from food. And so now imagine telling a gambling addict, well, you've got to play this slot, you know, a couple times a day, but no, more like, that's. That's really challenging.

So important for people to understand this, because obviously, as a neuroscientist, I think the nervous system is creating our thoughts. Our thoughts and feelings are related to psychology. And therefore, of course, our physiology and our psychology are one in the same. It's bi directional. Now, there's. Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in brain body, in particular, gut brain access, and we can talk about that, but I really appreciate that you're spelling out how there are these different variables. Each one can account for a number of different things. Exercise clearly has a remarkably potent effect, both during the exercise in terms of caloric burn, overall health, and biomarkers. And then this is wonderful to learn that it can increase the sensitivity to satiety signals. I think that makes, at least my mind places it very high on the list of things that people should absolutely do, but that there are other factors, too. And the identity piece is fascinating. It reminds me also, your story reminds me also of David Goggins, who is. He talks about his former very overweight self almost as if it was a different person.

It's not like you defeat this former version of yourself, and then that person is buried and gone. You said, I killed my clone today. And that's the way that David talks about it also. So this is a daily process. And I think this is not just a small detail in tying together all these things. I think that what you are describing is fundamental because we can pull on each one of these variables and talk about each one of them, but at the end of the day, we're a cohesive whole as an individual. Sorry, you were about to say."

        "text": "That's actually into one of my favorite topics, which is, you know, why do we have such a hard time with losing weight, but more so keeping it off? Because of obese people. Six out of every seven obese people will lose a significant amount of body weight in their life. So why do we still have an obesity problem? They don't keep it off. Why don't they keep it off? When you look at the research, basically what it suggests is because people think about, I'm going to do a diet and I'm going to lose this weight, and they do not give any thought to what happens afterwards. Right. It's like, think about if you have some kind of chronic disease or a diabetic, right? You can't just take insulin once and that's it. Right? You got to take it continuously, otherwise you're going to have problems. If you do a diet and you lose you know, 30 pounds, fantastic. But if you then just go back to all your old habits, you're going to go back to where you were, if not more. You can't create a new version of yourself while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you. So what I'll tell people is because people say, well, I'm doing a carnivore diet or I'm doing this diet or that diet, and I'll say, that's fine. Do you see yourself doing that for the rest of your life? And if the answer is yes, if you really believe that that's going to be sustainable for you and plenty of people, low carb, intermittent fasting, whatever they say, felt easy, you know, I could do this forever. Great. What? If you're going to lose weight, you have to invoke some form of restriction, whether it is a nutrient restriction, like low carb, low fat, a time restriction, intermittent fasting, any form of time restricted eating or calorie restriction, tracking, macros, whatever. So you get to pick the form of restriction. So pick the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive to you as an individual. And also do not assume that it will feel the same for everybody else because I made this mistake. Whereas I track things and so I allow myself to eat a variety of foods, I allow myself to eat some fun foods, but I track everything and I'm able to modify my body composition and be in good health. Doing that now doesn't feel hard for me. Part of it is I've just been doing it for so long. But to other people that's very stressful. They don't want to. They say, well, I'd rather just not eat for 16 hours if that feels easy for them, do that. Because the one thing that there was a couple of meta analysis on popular diets and basically what they showed was they were all equally terrible for long term weight loss, but when they stratified them by adherence and none of them were better for adherence overall, but when they stratified people just according from lowest adherence to best adherence, it was a linear effect on weight loss. So really what it says is, what is the diet that's going to be easiest for you to adhere to in the long term? And you should probably do that. And people, again, this is where I step back and take the 10,000 foot view. Somebody will say, well, I'm going to do ketogenic because I want to increase my fat oxidation and I want to do this. And they're talking about all these mechanisms and everything, and that's great. Can you do it for the rest of your life? Right. Is this going to be something sustainable for you? And if the answer is no, you probably need to rethink what your approach is going to be."

And he talked about love as a sort of an interesting aspect of our psychology, where it's a story that you co create with somebody, but that you live into the future of that story. You know, when you pair up with somebody that he was referring to romantic love, that there's this sort of mutual agreement to create this idea that you're going to live into. So it's not just about how you feel in the moment. It's also that you project into the future quite a lot. I'm seeing a lot of parallels with a highly functional and effective diet, and I love it.

And another important point was there was, I think there was 22 studies in this, but all of them provided food to the participants. Right. That's important because that makes.

To me, that's like, this is great because you get to pick the tool. You want that one tool, it doesn't seem to be that much better than another. So pick the one that works for you. Right.

Is there ever a case for someone saying, look, I like to eat low carb or even keto for six months and then switch to a more standard omnivore, caloric maintenance type diet and then switch back? Is there any downside to doing that for sake of health or weight loss over time or weight maintenance over time? Because I realize not everyone is trying to lose weight. And I definitely want to talk about at some point how to eat to maintain weight, because I think there are a significant, um, fraction of people out there who are trying to do that. Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I don't think it's how I would usually set things up initially for somebody, but if somebody said, hey, I just like to have some variety and change it up as long as they're still, like, you know, their behaviors and they're doing portion control or whatever it is, and they're able to sustain a calorie deficit or, you know, depending on whatever their goal is, I don't think there's really any downside to it. I do think the one thing to keep in mind is when you look at, like, going between extremes. So, like, low fat to low carb or. Or vice versa, um, there can be in that transition period, a little bit of weirdness, for lack of a better term. Like, for example, if you've been on a ketogenic diet and all of a sudden you move to, like, a higher carb diet, you'll be, like, basically insulin resistant for just a short period of time. Now, is that gonna cause any health problems? Probably not in the long term as long, especially if you're still controlling calories. But just because your body has kind of, like, upregulated these systems, dealing most with mostly with fat and glucose production rather than glucose metabolism. So now, if you start taking glucose or carbohydrate back in, like, for example, you give somebody an oral glucose tolerance test after they've been on keto, they'll do pretty terribly at it.

I've tried very low carbohydrate diet, and I would have assumed, and now I know I'm completely wrong, but I assumed that I was so carbohydrate starved for so long that my insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing, by the way, folks, would have gone through the roof, and I would be able to just sponge up every bit of glucose that I would have ingested through carbohydrate. So I did indeed switch over, and I felt like I had pretty terrible brain fog. I even got some jitters, and I thought, wait, what is this? You know, my blood sugar was low before. Now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory. But based on what you just said, I had upregulated the enzymes and systems in the body for fat metabolism on the keto diet and then switching over, there was basically a ramping up of the molecules involved in presumably in glycolysis."

Like you're going to be sore and stiff and all that kind of stuff. But I will say you aren't necessarily wrong in what you said about being more insulin sensitive, because it depends on how you measure insulin sensitivity. So if you measure with something like, you know, fasting blood glucose or fasting insulin or even homa ir, those tend to be pretty good on low carb, but then if you do an oral glucose tolerance test, it tends to be pretty bad. And so it depends on your specific measure, right. So I think that, you know, the idea that keto makes you, you know, glucose intolerant or insulin resistant, I think, again, it's just a transition period and I'm not too worried about it, but it is something important to keep in mind. And one of the reasons, like if somebody was to transition out of keto, typically if I'm working with them or one of our coaches are working with them, we'll kind of instruct them to do it slowly and kind of systematically over like a four to eight week period. That way, hopefully they're not having that period of two weeks where they're like, oh, man, why do I feel so terrible?"

But we've been sort of top down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight loss maintenance and weight gain. But gut health, at least the more popular studies on gut health, have blown a lot of things out of the water. For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice and literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice. And yes, that sounds like what it sounds like. Fecal transplants definitely inserted through the same end in which it comes out. And I point that out because a lot of people have asked me that they, it was kind of scary to me. I thought, yes, this is not about ingesting feces. They literally do a transplant of feeds from lean mice into obese mice, and the obese mice get lean. And yes, this has been done in humans. Limited number of studies and observed some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that I have to assume could be related to placebo effect. They might have told these obese people, hey, look, you're going to get lean through this fecal transplant from lean people, but more likely it had some effect on their core physiology. I don't know which aspects, although I can speculate which ones. And they became leaner, they lost weight, and that is in some sense miraculous, especially given the important role of psychology and exercise and satiety signals, because I'm going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables.

Right. So it's going to take time before you really understand the implications of the gut and what it means. So when it comes to weight loss, there probably is a role in there. I mean, we've seen that there's something going on. Now, whether that's, is it something where a gut microbiome makeup that's more obese resistant, perhaps it extracts less calories out of the food you eat. Right.

So exactly what you're saying. And in the gut, it seems to create an activation of the mechanosensors in the gut. So the perception is that the gut is full, even or fuller, I should say not full, because I think people who take semaglutide don't feel bloated. I don't know. They might, but that one feels as if their gut is actually fuller because these mechanosensors that send stretch are sending signals to the brain. Oh, I actually have some food. I'm not empty down there. Right. Anyway, I'm tickled by this result, mostly because every time I hear about a drug or a molecule having effect, we think it has an effect at one location. But it's kind of interesting that, especially for something like appetite regulation, that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel. Anyway, forgive me.

And then, you know, there's. There's, you know, metabolism in the adipocyte and skeletal muscle, but none of this stuff exists in isolation. There's so much crosstalk between these pathways, and that's, you know, when we get into mechanisms, the. One of the things. I love mechanisms, but one of the things I tell people is, keep in mind that when you're dealing with an outcome, right? So, like, when I say outcome based, we're talking about physical outcomes like weight loss, fat loss, changes in blood markers, whatever. That is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms so, sure, sometimes you can affect a, a mechanistic pathway, and you get kind of straight down the line outcome, but not always. You know, whenever you make a treatment or, you know, kind of anything into the system, it's like throwing a pebble in a lake. Right. It creates ripples, and we don't always know what those are going to be. Right. And that's why, I mean, we've seen, you know, certain drugs, well, it works on this pathway, and then they list off all the side effects, and you go, well, how would it create that many side effects? Because nothing, for the most part, they don't just work in one place. There's a multitude of places it works. And to your point about semiglutide and the effects on mechano sensors, it's probably why a lot of people report actually kind of like low grade nausea when they're using semiglutide. Because of that. Because if you're, you know, that feeling is usually not like a real comfortable feeling, but, I mean, it will get you to not eat. So I think there's absolutely likely a connection, but we haven't fully elucidated how that works. And when you think about how complicated the gut is, I think I heard something like, there's more, you know, there's more cells in our microbiome by far than there are in our body.

You know, like, maybe we are just maybe they are exploiting us to take them around and interact because they interact and grow on one another. And so this idea, this freaks people out. Lex Friedman will love this, that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the microbiome and not the other way around. Anyway, kind of a scary thought.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Doctor JusTIN so again, I'm going to kind of go straight down the line. From what I've heard from Suzanne, other experts. So if you want to improve gut health, one of the biggest levers, the three biggest levers you can pull is not eating too many calories, exercising. There is a connection between exercise in the gut and fiber. So we, it is, of the things we know, dietary fiber seems to positively impact the gut because it is a, what's called a prebiotic. So your gut microbiota can take especially soluble fiber, although there's actually some evidence, at least in mice, that they might be able to use some insoluble fiber as well. I think Suzanne was doing a study looking at hemicellulose and actually seeing that some specific forms of microbiota flourish with hemicellulose, suggesting that they may actually be getting some kind of fuel out of it, which is really interesting, again, in mice. So just huge caveat. So your gut microbiome can produce these short chain fatty acids by fermenting this soluble fiber. And there's quite a bit of evidence that these volatile fatty acids, which can be then actually reabsorbed in through the liver, that they have some positive effects, like, for example, butyrate. When they've done butyrate supplementation, they've actually seen positive effects on insulin sensitivity. So what we seem to understand is that more diversity seems to be better. Fiber seems to be positive. Prebiotics seem to work much better than probiotics supplemented prebiotics. Yes. So the problem with most of the probiotics is they're typically not concentrated enough to actually colonize. And even if you do colonize, what happens is like, let's say you colonize some microbiota that you didn't really have much of. But if you're not fueling it with the appropriate fiber, it's not going to stay anyway because it's essentially going to starve. So the research seems to really clearly suggest that eating enough fiber, which is, again, a prebiotic, that that is a better way to get a healthier gut per se than probiotic."

Fruits and vegetables, obviously, you know, grains, some whole grains, some cereals, and then various other sources. So this is one of the things where we don't really have a good idea if this one source of fiber is better than another source of fiber. We just know that fiber overall is pretty good. And one thing I'll tell people is if you want a longevity hack. I mean, fiber is kind of the longevity hack. If you look at some of these cohort studies, there was actually a recent, really large meta analysis of over a million subjects. And basically what it showed was that for every ten gram increase in fiber, there was a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality. And that extended specifically also to cardiovascular disease and cancer. So one of the things I'll tell people when they get, like, really into, you know, whether it's intermittent fasting or, you know, all these other things say, that's great, that's great.

Unfortunately, there doesn't really appear to be a top end, at least for the benefits of fiber. It probably boils down to, like, how much you can tolerate without feeling uncomfortable. Right, right.

You poop just fine without it. And I'll always say, well, pooping is the last reason to have fiber. Like, yes, it does help. It does seem to make elimination easier. You can do it more frequently, adds bulk to stool. But that's not why you should eat fiber. Why you should eat fiber is because of the effects of mortality. And some of the pushback will be, well, this is healthy user bias."

And a great example of that is, like, red meat. Not every study shows red meat has an association with cancer and mortality. There's differences depending on the population used, depending on, like, what they define as high red meat, low red meat, whether it's processed unprocessed. But I have not found a study on fiber and cardiovascular disease and cancer and mortality where it did not show improvements from higher fiber. So to me, that suggests that that effect is real. And so, again, you know, as much fiber as you can get in comfortably, I would try to do it because it seems to have some really powerful effects and is good for the gut microbiome. The other thing that may be a consideration for the microbiome is there's some evidence that saturated fat may not be great for the microbiome, that it reduces the prevalence of some of the more positive strains of bacteria. And that appears to be not so much from the saturated fat itself, but from the bile end product that combine with saturated fat. Seems to have a negative effect on some of these more healthier forms of gut microbiota. But again, this is really difficult, because we don't even know necessarily yet which species of gut microbiota are positive or negative. And that's. I mean, this gets into some of these studies where they may call it dysbiosis. Sounds scary, but dysbiosis just means that the gut changed. It doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't tell you anything qualitative about whether the change was bad or good. And so these are just things I think we need to keep in mind when we talk about this stuff, that this stuff is still very much in its infancy. But in terms of the big levers, I mean, it pretty much fits with what we know about a healthy lifestyle. Exercise, don't eat too much, consume a good amount of fiber from diverse sources."

But usually, like, one study is just going to move me just a little bit, then maybe if another one comes out, move me a little bit more, and then very slowly I'm going to get some. I mean, my experience with ldl cholesterol, this is something I changed my mind on a while back when I was younger, like circa 2005, getting into grad school, kind of the prevailing thought was, well, it's not so much the LDL, it's the ratio of LDL to HDL. That's what matters. And probably about five years ago, and I was pretty strong about that opinion. And then five years ago, looking at these mendelian randomization studies, I kind of went, I can't hold this position anymore."

Very rarely will you have high hdl and like high crP, which is an inflammatory marker or dysregulated blood glucose, almost exclusively, people who have high hdl will have good biomarkers of metabolic health. But if you take drugs that raise HDL, it doesn't reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. In mendelian randomization studies, which Mendelian randomization basically uses natural randomization. So some people are, in the case of HDL, naturally higher secretors or naturally lower secretors of hdL. And we talked about how you can't really do a 20 year human randomized control trial. And when you're trying to examine something like heart disease, I mean, that is a lifetime exposure issue. It's very unlikely that you're going to pick out differences between treatments in two years or even five years. I mean, people don't develop, typically don't develop heart disease until they're in their fifties, sixties and seventies. What Mendelian randomization allows is to say, okay, we have these people who naturally secrete more or less, so we can stratify those and look at what is their risk. So if you look at people who are low secreters of HDL versus high secreters of HDL, withholding some of the other key variables, consistent, like LDL, you don't see an effect on heart disease, really."

And we know that it's actually not so much LDL, but it's more apolipoprotein B. But that tends to track with ldl, just in general. And if you look at the mechanism, I mean, we know that ldl can penetrate the endothelium. So there's. The mechanism is present. If we look at the epidemiology, it supports that it's an independent risk factor. And then again, these mendelian randomization studies, where we can kind of look at people's exposure over a lifetime, and then we see that linear dose dependent effect, to me, that was convincing enough to change my mind on that particular topic. And then if you look at some of the Framingham data, look at if you stratify high hdl versus low hdl, both groups looking at high ldl and low ldl. So if you have high hdl, low ldl, you will still be lower risk factor than somebody who has high hdl and high ldl, right?"

But it took. It was like not just one study came out, it was, okay, then there was another study, and then another study, and then another study. And at a certain point, I go, okay, well, now I either have to change my mind, or I'm basically just gonna be cognitively dissonant and say, nope, I don't believe all that, you know? And so I think that's one of the things to keep in mind. People will say, are you saying this is a bad study? Very rarely. Why call something a bad study? Because data is just data, but the issue becomes how it is presented and how broadly it's applied in the mainstream media or by people on fitness influencers. And what I'll do is try to step in and say, okay, let's consider x, y and z as well. And then it's not a bad study, but let's just be careful about how broadly we imply the interpretation."

Because for those of you who don't know out there, you know, a lot of laboratory studies on mice and humans, for instance, in the realm of biochemistry or in vitro studies, you'll see a change in some molecule can be quite traumatic. And then the assumption is, oh, you just take, you take the drug that will change that molecule in a particular direction, and then you'll get the effect you want at the whole organism level.

We wanted to see how long does this last and where does it peak? My thought was, okay, well, it'll probably track with plasma leucine. For those that are not familiar, leucine is the amino acid that is almost exclusively responsible for increasing muscle protein synthesis when you eat protein. So it's one of the branch chain amino acids. So we wanted to see, okay, how long does this effect last? So we fed these animals whey protein. And again, I thought, okay, well, however long plasma leucine stays up, that will be how long protein synthesis stays up. And so we got the protein synthesis data back, and it was peaked at 90 minutes or, sorry, peaked from 45 to 90 minutes, and then was back down to baseline by 180 minutes. And so when I went to do the plasma leucine analysis, my shock was at 3 hours, plasma leucine was still plateaued out. And I said, okay, well, when I look at the initiation factors, that will show me something. So for those not familiar, this is part of the mTor signaling pathway. So one of the two of the targets of mTor, when it's stimulated, leucine stimulates mTor. Two of the targets of mTOR are a protein compound called four, Ebp one, and then another one is called ribosomal protein S six k. So I don't want to get into the specifics about it because it's kind of beyond the scope, but basically when these things are phosphorylated by mToR, it increases the rate of translation initiation, which translation initiation is basically the process of the ribosome hooking onto the mRNA and then starting protein synthesis. So I was looking at the phosphorylation of four ABP one and RPS six. I was like, okay, well, I'll probably see these things come down at 3 hours, still plateaued. And so then it was like, what's going on here? So I actually kept rerunning the data and rerunning the data and rerunning the data. And I'll never forget, I went into layman's office, and this is like six months after we've done this study, because this analysis takes time. He's like, so where are we with this duration study? I said, well, I just got to run the plasma data again because it's not right. And he's like, well, why is it not right? And I said, well, it just doesn't make any sense, you know? And I kind of went through, he's like, well, like, describe to me your technique. Like, how are you doing this? And I described it. He said, well what? How's your standard error? And I told him what the numbers were. He said, it sounds like it's good data. He said, it sounds like you are trying to get the data to fit your conclusion, and you need to change your conclusion to fit the data. And that statement."

But so I looked at that and said, why am I eating every 2 hours then? You know, and there was even a study out of wolf's lab, like back in 99 I think, where they infused amino essential amino acids for 6 hours.

It wasn't. We looked at all the plasma essential amino acids because, you know, we were thinking, well maybe protein synthesis is, you know, sucking some of these amino acids out of the plasma and they're dropping and that's causing it to kind of short circuit the system. That wasn't the case. It just essentially what the evidence suggests. I think we're the only ones to show this so far. So I'm not ready to say that this is a real effect because I hold out the idea that data artifacts do exist and you can't be totally sure, but we saw an increase in Amp kinase kind of around this mark where protein synthesis started falling off. And we also saw a decrease in intracellular ATP. And protein synthesis is an ATP dependent process. And so what we think might be happening is you're consuming protein and you're increasing muscle protein synthesis and then at a certain point it has enough effect on your energy metabolism in your cells that it kind of short, not short circuits it, but it kind of cuts it off. Right. So again, we're the only ones to show that, that I'm aware of. So. And that was, again in rats. So I always talk about data like there's data I'm willing to bet my, my toe on, my foot on, my leg on and my life on. I'd probably barely bet the end of my little toe on that one. I'm not quite sure, but it's interesting nonetheless. So proportionally, that's a great example of, okay, we're looking at this mechanism of mTOR signaling, and if we just looked at that, we'd say, oh, well, protein synthesis is going to stay elevated for, you know, past 3 hours, but that's not what we saw. So, yeah, I think it's, again, that's why I really try to, you know, get people to say, well, let's. Mechanisms are important. It's. And especially if you're seeing an outcome, it's important to identify mechanisms that may explain that. But let's step back from the mechanisms, from trying to chase mechanisms, and let's look at, like, chasing outcomes in terms of what we recommend to people."

And several times throughout today's conversation, we've come back to this issue of satiety signals. Whether or not they're brain based, body based, or both, not wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain or lose weight because you simply don't want to. I heard you mentioned earlier that protein, and maybe specific types of protein or sources of protein, may provide better satiety signals than other macronutrients. Could you briefly talk about how macronutrients, including protein, but also carbohydrates and fats, impact satiety? And from the standpoint of somebody who, for instance, would like to, quote unquote, lose a few pounds, right. Probably would be happy to gain a little bit of lean body mass, provided it was in a particular location on their body. That seems to be a thing now, directed hypertrophy, if you will, and how much they should focus on protein as a core component of creating this diet, assuming everything else has been done correctly, they're going to hit the right number of calories relative to their output, meat, etcetera, how should we think about protein and satiety signals? And are animal sources of protein indeed more bioavailable? That's a tricky word. Um, it for sake of muscle building, but also for sake of somebody who just would like to lose body fat. They don't want to lose muscle, and they'd like to bring their weight down a few pounds."

Uh, of the macronutrients, protein is definitely the biggest lever that you can pull, because even if you know, it doesn't take a ton of protein to get a lot of the muscle building benefits. I mean, I think the benefits really start to plateau out around 1.6 grams/kg of body weight. There's some evidence that maybe even up to like 2.4 or 2.8 grams per kilo may give, like, a little bit more benefit. I think it probably looks something like an asymptote in terms of a curve where as you put more into the system, you always get a little bit more. But it just gets to the point where it's so infinitesimally small benefit that it's, for all intents and purposes, no benefit."

        "text": "I see very few downsides to hitting that. I mean, I know some people, and this is going to get into a separate conversation, but I know some people say, well, I don't want to stimulate mTor because that's going to make me die early. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is if you look at, there's kind of this thought process out there that if you're stimulating inventory, that protein is going to make you die early. And first off, we have very little human outcome data to support that claim. And the second thing is, if you look at any macronutrient isolation, I can make a mechanistic argument that it's going to kill you. So fat, if you take in fat, decreases flow mediated dilation. Flow mediated dilation is important for heart health in the short term. Carbohydrates stimulate insulin, insulin pro inflammatory, and all these other things. And so I can make an argument for any single macronutrient to be negative for longevity. I really want people, this is something that even scientists get wrong. They look at an acute response of something and assume that that is going to relate to long term outcomes and signaling. So let's just take exercise. For example. If I, if you didn't know anything about exercise, and I said to you, Andrew, I'm going to do something that's going to make you, your heart rate go up, your blood pressure go up, your inflammatory markers go up, your reactive oxygen species increase, you're going to say, and it's going to damage your muscles. You're going to say, I'm not doing that. That sounds horrible. You know, it does all those things in the short term, but what is the long term effect of exercise? You actually get healthier. All those things improve. Now, I'm not saying that protein is a longevity hack or anything like that, but what I'm saying is I think some of the arguments out there based on mechanistic this increases inventory, therefore we don't want to do it. I think it is a much more complicated argument than just that. So theres that. So protein is the biggest lever I would shoot for 1.6 grams/kg if you can do more, great. There doesnt seem to be really downsides to it, even up to very high levels of protein. Jose Antonio did a study that was a year long randomized control trial and again its just one year. But they were looking at all sorts of different biomarkers and basically even up to 4 grams/kg of protein, they couldnt really find any negative health outcomes from it other than people were just so satiated they ended up eating less calories. So protein is a big lever because one, it has a higher thermic effect of food. So you're getting a little bit more calorie burn per day even though it's not a ton because TEF is a pretty small percentage of your overall energy expenditure, but still a benefit. You're getting the effects on lean body mass. If you're in a diet, it's going to help preserve lean body mass. If you're at maintenance it's going to help build a preserve lean body mass. And if you're in a surplus, it's going to help build a preserve lean body mass. Then you get the effects on appetite. So now I want to be careful because appetite effects tend to be very specific to individual foods, right? So you can take a high protein food and make it not very, not very sadiating. So take for example like a really tasty protein bar, which, you know, back when we were getting into this, there no such thing existed. Now you have protein bars. Actually take pretty darn good. But if you eat one of them, I mean are you really satiated? I don't really feel satiated."

I mean, if I had to pick one food that I could eat, even though I'm not pure carnivore for the rest of my life, it would be that, because I think it would get me where I need to go and then I'd probably have to sneak some fiber. But it's an excellent point. I have a question that I don't want to take us off track, but I'm hoping it relates enough that you could answer it now in the context of this. If I'm going to eat, let's say, 2 grams/kg of body weight protein, and I'm not eating multiple meals, maybe I'm eating two or three meals per day, I'm certainly going to be eating more than the 30 grams threshold that was thrown around for a long time, that we can only assimilate 30 grams of protein per meal. Should I just not worry about that? Some of it is going to go towards the thermic effect of food. Some of that might be converted into glucose, of all things, through gluconeogenesis. So should I worry about this 30 grams cut off? Because I think balancing the 1.6 grams per kilogram body weight threshold with number of meals, with the need to exercise and work and live my life and sleep, etcetera, pretty soon you run into bottlenecks where you just can't do it all, or you're spending so much time trying to focus on, you can't optimize."

So if you look at that and then you consider that protein doesn't really have a storage mechanism, people will say, well, lean tissue is a storage mechanism. That's like saying a house is a storage facility for wood. Yeah, if the house is made out of wood, you could get wood out of it. But that's not why you build the house, right? Like, you're building the house out of a demand. Same thing for a muscle tissue. There is a free pool of amino acids, but it's very, very small. So when you consider things like fat, which basically has unlimited storage capacity, carbohydrate, a relatively large storage capacity. You can store four or 500 grams of carbohydrate between your liver and muscles. And then protein, which almost has no storage capacity. The idea that, okay, you could make up for low protein at one meal by over consuming another meal didn't make sense to me. So one of the studies we did, and again in rats we took, both groups were getting whey protein, so high quality protein. They were getting the exact same amount of calories, exact same amount of, you know, nitrogen, exact same macros. Everything was the same. The only difference was one group basically got kind of three meals of similar amounts of protein. Like, dinner was a little bit bigger because we wanted to keep it somewhat similar to how people eat. But each meal was going to be over the threshold to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, whereas the other group, I constructed it. So the first two meals of the day should not stimulate muscle protein synthesis. It should be under that threshold. And then the last meal was about 70% of their total daily protein. And so we had them eat those for eleven weeks. And I'll never forget this. This is how, like, obsessive I became about it is there was 110 animals in this study, and I made all the diets, and I weighed out exactly every single meal for every single animal for eleven weeks. So I was in there at 06:00 a.m. i was in there at noon and then I was in there at 06:00 p.m. i love it."

We didn't really see differences in lean body mass, but what we did see was a difference in hind limb weights. It wasn't massive, but there was a significant difference in the size of the muscles of the hind limbs of these animals. And so it's interesting that there wasn't a difference in lean body mass. And what we found, at least with the liver, the animals that were eating the, like, one meal with really high protein actually had bigger livers, not like a huge amount, and not something that I would consider unsafe, but it was a statistically significant difference. And so to me at least, like, if I'm trying to explain, like, no difference in lean body mass, but a difference in these hind limb weights, maybe there's some, like, sequestering of, you know, like that that's fueling a little bit more protein synthesis of the splanchnic tissues rather than, you know, because you're capping out skeletal muscle protein synthesis. And we do know that the splanchnic tissues are more sensitive or have a greater rate of protein synthesis per day. Like, the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in humans is about like 1% per day. So it takes like 100 days to turn over, you know, skeletal muscle, whereas, like, your entire gut, your entire gi, will turn itself over in like two to three days. Right. So really? And the liver also has a very high amount of protein synthesis, which is one of the reasons it's actually one of the most metabolically active organs. So all that to say, it has not. There's been one human study that showed something similar, and then there's been a couple others that didn't. And then in the intermittent fasting studies, which is maybe a good tool to look at compared to continuous feeding, one thing I will say is it looks like the 16 eight intermittent fasting style. There's been a couple studies with Grant Tinsley, and this is something I've changed my mind on as well. Grant Tinsley has done a couple studies where they did use the 16 eight protocol. They had them trained during their feeding window and they had them eat, I think it was at least three protein containing meals during those 8 hours."

And they saw no difference in lean body mass at the end of the study compared to people who were eating like, you know, as many times as they wanted throughout the day. Now, if you look at some of the more extreme forms of fasting, like alternate day fasting or like 22, two or 24, there are some studies where you do start to see differences in lean body mass. So my suspicion is, and I'm just guessing, so this is tenuous. My suspicion is probably if you're getting like two to three, like, high quality protein meals in a day, you're getting the vast majority of the benefits of protein. The most important thing is getting enough total and then secondarily trying to get at least two or three meals with high quality protein in. But if you're going like, pretty extreme with, like, alternate day fasting or, you know, maybe only one meal a day, then I think there may be some effects on lean body mass. But again, these can be mitigated as well. If you're doing, you know, hard resistance training, typically that is the biggest lever in terms of lean body mass. Yes. You know, protein distribution may make a difference, but I'm trying to put it in context so people don't feel like they need to go out and eat, you know, four meals a day. But again, so what I would say is, like, some of the more milder forms of, you know, time restricted eating appear to be fine for lean body mass. Now, the, the caveat is the following. One of the nice things about animal studies is when you consider, if you want to have a high subject number, high level of control and a long duration, it's pretty much your only option, right? So I have a, in our research review, reps, I created a Venn diagram, which basically is like three circles crossing over. One is study duration, one is level of control, and the other one is subject number. And to get all three of those circles to cross over, it almost has."

So basically, when people might look at, like, my study, well, why did you see a difference in muscle weights whereas some of these other studies don't see a difference? I weighed out every single meal for eleven weeks. And keep in mind that eleven weeks in a rodent's lifespan is a really long time. That's about an 8th of their total lifespan. So is it that there's no effect or is it that the effect is relatively small and would take a really long time and very high level of control to see in humans? I don't know, but I think what I would say relatively confidently is if you're going to do like a 16 eight intermittent fasting, you're probably fine, especially. And again, what is the goal? Right. Like if you're a bodybuilder looking to be the most massive person you possibly can, or you're a football player, you're some in some field that having as much lean body mass as possible is really important for you, then I would say, well, you're not really gaining a whole lot by doing some form of time restricted eating."

And again, I don't want somebody to think, well, I do, you know, alternate day fasting. There's no point to me resistance training because I'm going to lose muscle mass. No, no, no, no. You can still build muscle doing that. You just might not build as much muscle as you would if you were eating in a more traditional format. But if that's something that works for you and your goals, and especially if it's fat loss or controlling your calories, then again, it's about the hierarchy of what's important. To answer your question, I do think that timing and frequency matters. Not so much frequency, but distribution more. So. So I think the distribution matters, but it's a much smaller lever than just getting enough total protein in. And then as far as like animal versus plant, I used to be in the camp of there's no way somebody can build as much muscle on a plant based diet. And now I think I've come back to you can. It just requires a little bit more planning. And I don't want to say always, but it's very difficult to do without an isolated source of protein. So unless you're going to supplement with an isolated plant source of protein, it's very difficult to get enough without going over on total calories because you can figure that especially like take somebody who may be calorically restricted trying to get enough protein from whole intact plant sources. So you've got a few different things working against you. One, the sources of protein you're consuming also have carbohydrate and or fat. Two, it's a less bioavailable form of protein. And three, it's a lower quality of protein in terms of it has typically less leucine, less branched amino acids and less essential amino acids."

And it sounds like that is one of the components and that a lot of the vegan and vegetarian sources of excellent protein. That excellent protein, vegetarian or vegan source, is co packaged with calories from carbohydrates and or fat that make it hard to stay under the caloric threshold, whereas a steak is, I'm not. And obviously people might want to avoid that for ethical reasons, but that's a different matter entirely. But a steak or a piece of chicken or an egg is, well, an egg has a yolk, which is, there's fat there, but is almost a pure protein fat source. There's no carbohydrate along for the ride."

So I think what I would say is, you know, you can do it takes a little more planning and you're almost always, if you're a vegan especially, you're going to be better off like supplement with some isolated form of protein or vegan form of protein. Now this where it gets into people say, well, what about the limiting amino acids and those sorts of things? It's a consideration. Some of the better forms of vegan protein in terms of amino acid content are like soy. Now I can everybody hear everybody screaming online about their testosterone levels in terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone. There was a recent meta analysis looking at Soyez, and I think if it's your only source of protein, then maybe the dosage is high enough to cause some weird effects. But if you're just using it like once or twice a day, doesn't seem to have an effect on testosterone or estrogen. So that can be a decent source of protein because it is a complete protein source. It does have a PD coS of one, which PD coS is basically a measure of protein quality based on does it provide enough of all the amino acids so that none are limiting? And so soy is one of the only vegan sources that does that. Interestingly, potato protein isolate actually has a similar essential amino acid content to whey. So isolated potato protein, it's just really hard to find, I've been trying to find."

And actually, they're actually creating whey now out of, I think it's, I may mischaracterize this, but I believe they're able to produce it out of like yeast or something like that. Amazing that, you know. So for vegans now, this is a great option because you can have whey that's not animal based. That is going to be every bit as good as an animal based whey. So I think that's great. Getting to the leucine. Let me go back. Sorry. So another reason that the using an isolated protein can be helpful is because it's more bioavailable as well when it's been isolated out. When it's the protein bound up in the actual plant material, it tends to be less bioavailable. Now cooking can help increase the bioavailability because it breaks some of those bonds and whatnot, but it still seems to be lower and you don't. It's really interesting. There was a recent study where they did a corn, wheat and pea blend of protein versus whey. And basically the outcome was 30 grams of each stimulated protein synthesis to a similar degree. But the plasma amino acids in the plant based protein still did not get as high as with whey. Now it may be that that's just, it doesn't matter because once you get to a certain level you get all the benefits. But I still found it interesting nonetheless that they didn't quite get as high. The other thing to consider with the vegan sources of protein is the leucine content. So one of the studies we did was we looked at wheat, soy, egg and whey isonitrogenous, meaning we equated protein between the groups, isocaloric, we equated calories and we looked at muscle protein synthesis. And I think this was the meals were 15% of total energy from protein. So like a, like your food guide pyramid level of protein. And we saw that in the wheat and soy group, they did not increase muscle protein synthesis, but the egg and whey group increased muscle protein synthesis. Now what's really interesting is we went back and we took wheat and added free leucine to it to match the leucine content of whey. And the protein synthetic response was identical. So again, I don't like to simplify things too much, but leucine appears to really be driving this ship. And I'll never forget, layman called me in his office one day, and he would always do these like, thought experiments of he liked to think about why something occurs the way it does."

You would want something that really wasn't extensively metabolized by the gut and liver because you would want it to show up in the blood in values that reflect what you just ate. Makes sense.

And then theres options like blends, especially with corn. Corn is actually very high in leucine as a percentage of its protein. Now youve got to remember like, you go eat corn on a cob and youre getting like 2 grams of total protein. So its not that much leucine. But if you isolate out the protein, put it into a powder, well, now when you're getting like 80, 90% of the weight is now protein, corn is actually about 12% leucine in terms of the protein. So a great source of leucine. It is like almost frank deficient in some other amino acids, but you can blend it with a few other sources of protein. Like you could blend it with a soy, a pea, and you can create these complementary blends that would actually have quite a bit of leucine, but also some of the other essential amino acids. So there are options out there for plant based folks. And, I mean, we have seen people who are plant based, you know, build impressive amounts of muscle.

Can we come up with a relatively short summary of the following? Tell me if this is correct or not, that most of us should be focused on, for sake of health, health span and lifespan, should be focused on ingesting minimally non processed and minimally processed foods, maybe even cooking our own food.

I've been dying to ask you this, which is, if sugar intake is not actually going up as much as people think it is, why are people getting so much fatter?

You know, people said, well, it's carbon, it's sugar. It doesn't appear to be sugar in terms of just in isolation. Well, it's fats. Doesn't appear to be fats in isolation. Well, it's the combination of sugar and fat partly. Well, it's the combination of sugar, fat and salt, partly. But there's some kind of, like, overall magic to the texture and the mouth feel and just the overall palatability of stuff, which is always why I say theres, like, right and wrong ways to these different diets. Like, for example, theres a right way to do plant based, and then theres, you know, like, whats in some of these documentaries where theyre eating like plant based Mac and cheese, you know, and again, I love a good Mac and cheese, but like that should not form. Like that should not be pitched as a healthy diet just because its plant based. Right. Because I mean youre eating a highly processed food thats very palatable and easy to overeat. Same thing for keto. Youve now got like keto ice creams and youve got keto cookies and all these sorts of things. And im like, yeah. And if you look at them, they actually have more calories than the normal stuff. And im like, yeah, this is completely missing the point here. Like youre actually just taking yourself like the whole point of those diets is the reason you tend to lose weight is originally like good luck ten years ago doing a keto diet, eating processed food, right. Like you just couldn't do it really. Now you can. But the problem is it's not going to work because you're going to be still consuming too many calories because even though it's keto, what are they doing? Well, they're trying to make it more palatable. They're trying to make a better mouth feel, which I guess if you're being keto for the sake of being keto, great. But if there's, if you have hopes of body composition modification, it's going to, you know, really negatively impact. So, yes, I think minimizing the amount of processed food you consume can be important. Now, that being said, it depends on the individual and their goals. If your goal is to, for example, build muscle or maintain a high body weight for a sport, for example like an NFL offensive lineman or something of that nature, or if you're, you know, I worked with an NBA team. They were kind of, I can't disclose anything, but they were looking at drafting a certain player. And you know, like for them, processed foods may actually be a tool or teenagers, right."

Is it okay for me to buy $100,000 sports car if I still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities and like take care of my responsibilities, the things I should do. Is it okay if I do that? If it like makes me feel good and it's fun? Yeah, it's fine, right? Like it fits in your budget. If I make 50 grand a year, should I be going out and buying a sports car? Probably not, because I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage and all these other responsibilities. So your protein, your fiber, your micronutrients, these are your responsibilities.

Quite frankly, you'll be miserable because you're going to have such gut fill that you're going to feel like you can't even move. And so again now it becomes okay, well is there something inherent to that food processing? Is there something that we can pick out that we know? Okay, well this is going to be a negative effect on health. Even like body composition stuff aside. And I would say theres not really great evidence of that so far.

I think that people don't like the concept of energy balance, and I think because they insert judgment into it, which is okay if you're gaining weight over time, at a fundamental level, it means you are eating, you're consuming more energy than you're expending. People insert the judgment, which is you're lazy, you're a sloth, or whatever it is. And I think there's a lot of people out there who actually think that. I actually remember talking to somebody who was like, well, I would never hire an obese person for a job because it's just obvious that they're lazy. And I just remembered going, are you serious? Like, there are plenty of very, very smart, high achieving people who are obese. This is what happens when you just put people in buckets. People are much more complicated than this. Yes, there is some personal responsibility, but then when you look through the data and you take. There was a study done in Ob swimming where they found that women who were obese were 50% more likely to have had some form of sexual assault trauma in their past. Right. We know that people from lower income areas are more prone to be obese. There's several, like, people who have a higher ace score, I believe, which is kind of measures like traumatic childhood events. I believe there was a study showing they're more likely to be obese. So there's. Yes, it is an energy imbalance problem, but just saying, eat less, move more, that's like telling broke people, well, just earn more money than you spend. It's technically right, but it's very unhelpful. What is more helpful is to describe and implement the habits and behaviors that will allow them to achieve that. I realize we got off track a little bit, but circling back to, like, sugar circa 2005, I believe that sugar was fattening and bad for your health, independent of any other variable. So independent risk factor. And again, I want to be very clear about what independent means. Independent means independent of all other variables. This thing is bad for your health and body composition."

I was at a graduate school mixer, and one of the professors, there was somebody who had done research on high fructose corn syrup, and fructose specifically as well. And he was talking to another professor, and he had done this study in rodents where he'd fed, like, I think it was like, 60 or 70% of their calories from fructose. And they saw some really weird things happen in the liver with Anova, lipogenesis, and all this kind of stuff. And the other professor is saying to him, yeah, it's pretty obvious that high fructose corn syrup is, you know, fattening. And this professor who had done this research said, yeah, because it's people overeat. And he's like, don't you think there's something inherent to it? And he said, no, I think it's just calories. People are eating too many calories. He's like, we did a proof of concept looking at, you know, could we, like, try eating 70% of your daily calories from fructose? You actually can't do it. Like, high fructose corn syrup is only 55% fructose. So if you ate nothing but high fructose corn syrup, you would still not get to this level that they fed in this study. So that got me kind of, like, questioning my beliefs about it. So then I went through and I said, okay, like, let's take out the epidemiology. Not that epidemiology is useless, but people who eat more sugar are also likely to eat more calories. So then I looked for the randomized control trials where they, you know, match calories and vary the amount of sugar. And it doesn't seem to make a difference, at least from fat loss or fat gain."

They tend to have worse biomarkers of health. But people who eat fruit, a lot of fruit sugar, don't have those same associations. So why is that? Well, because fruit has fiber with it, right? So I started to kind of believe, based on the data I was looking at, that high sugar intake was not the problem per se. The problem was that high sugary foods typically are very low in fiber. But if you're getting enough fiber, is sugar a problem? So there was a classic study by Cerwit in 1997. I think it's still the best study to this day. Looking at this, and I know there's, people say, well, it was done in 1997, it has no relevance. You know, I know if it's a good study, it's a good study."

        "text": "We're not going to go back and undo the discovery of DNA because it was, you know, 60 years ago or whatever it is. So they looked at an 1100 calorie diet. So low calorie diet. One group was eating over 110 grams of sugar a day, like sucrose. The other group was eating about 10 grams of sugar per day. Calories, protein, carbs, fats, all matched. Right. And they provided all the meals to these participants, so very tightly controlled. And it was over six weeks. Both groups lost the exact same amount of body fat. So it doesn't seem to matter for body composition in terms of like sugar per se. Then they also looked at some biomarkers of health, like blood lipids and, you know, blood sugar and some other things. Again, there was no real differences. The only difference was so all their biomarkers improved in both groups. The only real difference was a small difference in LDL. So the group eating low sugar had a better improvement, slightly in LDL, but thats probably because they were eating more fiber. And we know fiber can bind to cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol. Now, I want to caveat. This sugar probably doesnt have any positive health effects. So theres that. Right. Nutrition is an exchange. If you're eating one thing, you're not eating another thing. Right. So I, but what I would tell people is focus probably less on sugar, focus more on fiber. So if you're eating 30, 40, 50, 60 grams of fiber a day, but your sugar is, you know, 80, 90 grams, I would not be that worried about it, especially if you're controlling calories as well. You know what I would be worried about is if you're eating just a decent amount of calories and not getting enough fiber in general. Right. And even in studies, there's a few meta analyses out now looking at ISO energetic exchange of different carbohydrates with sugar. Carbohydrates. So fructose and glucose and sucrose. Now, why is this important? Well, again, you know, if you're not equate, when I say ISO energetic, that means equal in energy, equal in calories, calories so basically, when they exchange either sucrose or glucose or fructose for other forms of carbohydrate, do they see differences in these markers of health like hbA, one c, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, and with rare exceptions, and I can't remember all the data points exactly, but the take home is, doesn't really seem to make a difference. Now before anybody out there, straw man's my argument. I am not advocating for sugar consumption, but I think it's important for people to not create weird associations in their minds because one of the things I've observed, especially in the fitness industry, is when people feel like they can't eat something. Like, it's one thing if you say I am choosing not to eat this just because I'm choosing to, but it's a very different thing when you're purposely restricting because you feel like something is bad. And this, I mean, you know, the human brain is in many ways amazing, in many ways really dumb. So when you purposely try to restrict something, what tends to happen is you're more prone to binge on it. So people who will try to, well, I'm never going to eat sugar again or I'm going to try and limit sugar. This isn't the case for everybody. But they have actually shown now in studies, people who are purposely restricting a specific nutrient, they tend to crave more of that nutrient. And if they do get exposed to it, they're more likely to have what's called a disinhibition reflex, which is basically a binge response because the thinking goes, well, this is bad. And there's no context on dosage making the poison. This is just bad in general. So if I have it, I've already screwed up. I might as well just have as much as I want. And I like Spencer Nadolsky's comparison to this is, you know, that's like, you know, getting a flat and then going out and slashing your other three tires because, you know, you might as well. So I really, I try to come from that perspective of, I've seen so many people struggle with, you know, maybe not an eating disorder, but disordered eating patterns because of these kind of associations they've made in their mind. And so that's why I'm so pedantic and a stickler about saying, okay, yes, it's a good idea to eat mentally processed food and try to avoid processed foods, but not because processed foods are bad per se, but what the outcome tends to be from a lot of processed food consumption, which is over consuming calories and then therefore, you know, energy toxicity negatively contributing to your health."

        "text": "Yeah, it seems like it again returns to the potential for a positive, negative or neutral behavioral change and perceptual change of like craving of food all the time that you can't have is terrible. That's a terrible state to be in. And this, I think, is a perfect segue for something that first brought us together, which was this thing about artificial sweeteners. And let me just for the record be very clear. I have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners. So I, throughout graduate school, I didnt have the best habits. Theyre healthier now than they were back then. But I would drink a Diet Coke or two per day. I still have the occasional Diet Coke. Im not completely averse to drink something that has artificial sweetener, although I do avoid sucralose for reasons that maybe can get into a little bit later. But a lot of the things I consume contain stevia, which is not artificial plant, but it is a plant based non caloric sweetener or low caloric sweetener. And I don't have a problem with that. I became very interested in artificial sweeteners because of the animal data pointing to the idea that they may disrupt the gut microbiome and then disrupt the gut microbiome, as you pointed out, is a very broad statement. We don't really know the percentage of lactobacillus exobacillus or whatever psilus illus in there. They all seem to end in ilis is ideal. And in fact, a lot of these companies that are having people send in their stool samples for analysis of the microbiome, I mean, take note. We don't really know what a healthy microbiome looks like, but we know what an unhealthy microbiome might look like. And it's one that doesn't have a lot of diversity in there. So I was interested in that. There's the recent human study, which we should definitely get into, but I was mostly interested in artificial sweeteners for the reason that there is this food conditioning effect. And you see it in animals and you see it in humans, that if you ingest, well, coffee is a really good example. Coffee doesn't actually taste good, folks, even though I like it. But when you taste coffee for the first time, most people think it's bitter and disgusting. Most everybody, like 95% of people say this doesn't taste good."

Caffeine is one of the few drugs we ingest just to feel ourselves enough that soon, myself included, really look forward to and enjoy a cup of coffee. So it's a powerful example, in my opinion, of the food conditioning effect. So it's like a pavlovian thing. Instead of salivating, you crave. Right. And it did seem that this study from Dana Small's lab, which admittedly was a small, no pun intended, study itself, not very many subjects, showed that if you ingested artificial sweeteners along with food that contained glucose, that you could or maybe even get a heightened glucose response just from the artificial sweeteners. After a while, you and I connected over this study on social media. You pointed out that the design of the study wasn't superb. There was co consumption of glucose, which made it complicated. We can go into that. But the reason I'm spouting off all this context is artificial sweeteners are many things I'd like to talk about their effects on blood sugar in the acute sense, and according to what we might ingest them with, and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation at the level of brain and or body, and then the gut microbiome data, I think, are interesting enough to discuss. And I have changed my view on artificial sweeteners based on what you've taught me. So this is a case where I've completely changed my view, which is that now I don't have any problem with them whatsoever, based on the current data, which is not to say that I'm gulping down cupfuls of superlose, but I feel okay ingesting some stevia and some aspartame, and I'm not too worried about it."

So there is no situation where it is not a net positive to take somebody who drinks sugar sweetened beverages and have them drink an artificially sweetened beverage. Like in the meta analysis, there was actually a recent network meta analysis looking at, like, markers of adiposity, you know, hba, one c, a bunch of different health markers. And when you substitute, you know, we'll call it non nutritive sweeteners, since stevia is not artificial. But. So when you substitute nns for the sugar sweetened beverages, you see improvements in a lot of different things. Okay. What was really interesting about this network meta analysis was they also looked at water substitution in place of sugar sweetened beverages. And the effect wasn't as powerful as, and these are randomized control trials."

Water and water and non nutritive sweetener beverages performed similar, but they were better than sugar sweetened beverages, obviously. So they then, based on a network meta analysis, is kind of where you can compare two things that didn't get compared directly. So there's not many studies comparing NNS versus water directly, but if you have a common comparator. So if you compare a to b and b gets compared to c, you compare a to c based on how they interacted with b, I'm butchering it a little bit. But that's kind of the crux of a network meta analysis. So they looked at NNS versus water and found that actually NNS was slightly better for improving adiposity."

Now, this gets a little more complicated because if these were people drinking sugar sweetened beverages, maybe theyve already developed a sweet taste and tried to go to water is too much of a jump for them. And so going to having something like intermediate is a little bit better. Like, theres a lot wrapped up in this. But these are the randomized control trials, which are a little bit more tightly controlled, which I tend to default to a little bit more than I do the epidemiology, which epidemiology is just so messy because sure, non nutritive sweetener consumption may be associated with different things, but theres also a whole other set of lifestyle and habits that are tied up in that. So I tend to hang my hat a little bit more on the randomized control trials. So understanding that, okay, now, all things being equal, understanding that this is a tool that may help some people. And whenever I post about non nutritive sweeteners in the comments, there's always one or two or three people who say, all I did was cut out soda and I drank diet soda instead, and I lost 50 pounds or I lost 75 pounds. I even had one per se. I lost 100 pounds. That's the only thing I did."

Is that obese person who lost 100 pounds by doing that, do I really care about maybe a small alteration to their gut microbiome? No, because their gut microbiome is actually much more healthy now by them having lost all that excess adipose tissue. So, again, the ranking of what I'm worried about can change depending on the specific situation. Now, let's take somebody like me, who's lean and doesn't really have any health problems that I'm aware of. What about artificial sweeteners? For me? Well, for me, I kind of got using them because of bodybuilding contest prep because it was about the only appetite suppressant that worked for me. But do I think that they are healthful? Probably not. Do I think they're unhealthy? I would say, based on the current data, I don't think that they're unhealthy. Now, the information on blood glucose. So there's some of the problems with some of these meta analyses or these reviews, is they kind of lump all the non nutritive sweeteners together, and then they may say, well, there's no effect on this, or there's an effect on this. Well, the problem is these are different molecules, and they can interact differently. Aspartame very clearly seems to have no effect on blood sugar or insulin. That has been repeatedly shown. Stevia doesn't appear to have much effect. Saccharin and sucralose, the jury is kind of mixed. Now, there was the study that we first connected on, which I think their primary outcome measure was actually, they were looking at kind of the sweet taste, like how it affected sweet taste. So what they did was the group that was getting the sucralose was also paired with maltodextrin. The control group was getting sucrose, which is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste, because maltodextrin is not as sweet as sucrose. So when you're trying to combine sucralose, which is already sweet, with another form of carbohydrate, you'd want something less sweet compared to your control. But for the outcome measure of insulin and blood glucose probably not as appropriate, because we know maltodextrin has a much higher glycemic index than sucrose."

I mean, it seemed like there was something hazardous about. This was at Yale School of medicine. It's a good place. I mean, there's a range everywhere. It just seemed like there's something about sweet tastes that, if taken to the extreme, might be able to impact blood sugar. This has impacted my sort of behavior. I try to avoid really sweet things unless they're exceptionally delicious or the occasion calls for them, because I do think that it increases my craving for sweet things."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, it might not be necessarily a craving, but it just programs you. So your taste buds are extremely adaptable. So take, for example, like, indian food. If you bring indian people over to America and have them eat some of our food, they think it tastes extremely bland because they are used to such spicy food that unless they have a certain level of spice, they hardly even taste it. If you've ever done a high sodium diet and then gone to a low sodium diethyde, it feels very bland."

Like, if somebody's obese and they said, well, this is going to help me, you know, eliminate sugar sweetened beverage. Like, why would you want to take that tool away from them? Like, that's a great lever to pull. I mean, if somebody can lose literally 100 pounds from just one change in lifestyle, that's not even really that inconvenient of a change. That is powerful. But again, is it the most healthy thing they could do? And I think that's kind of like, what tends to get asked. We don't know, is it healthier than water. Probably not. Maybe as healthy as it. Who knows? Now the. But I really make all those caveats because you don't want to have people who could use this as a tool think, well, no, I can't do this because it's actually bad for me."

And then there was a ten week study that came out that got a lot of press, and they showed, I think it was sucralose. I think they showed an effect of change on the gut microbiome. Now, what was interesting is when I went into the species that changed, the species that changed the most compared to the control, was a species called. I'm gonna butcher the name.

So, interestingly, that particular species of bacteria is actually associated with lower adiposity, better insulin sensitivity, and people who are obese and children who are obese tend to have less of it. So I said, well, based on that study, you could actually argue that maybe sucralose actually improved the gut microbiome. Now, again, I'm not making that claim because, you know, we have a hard time understanding what a healthy microbiome looks like already what this last study that came out, my biggest take home was. I think it's safe to say that some of these non nutritive sweeteners are not metabolically inert, that there are some effects. Now, are those effects good, bad or neutral? I think has yet to be fully elucidated. Now, I focused more on the blood glucose responses in my analysis. So in that ten week study, they looked at, they did oral glucose tolerance tests, and their conclusion, I didn't really feel like fit their data. So their conclusion was that. And again, I think it was sucralose that it elevated blood glucose. And this is where statistics can get kind of tricky. My take home was the area under the curve, the incremental area under the curve, which is looking at basically the entire glucose response, was not different between the control and the sucralose group. To me, that's the biggest take home. There was one time point at the end of the study in the sucralose group, the 30 minutes time point that was statistically significantly higher blood glucose than the control group. That's kind of one of those things where I go, okay, it was one time point, it's statistically significant. But even then, we've seen things be statistically significant that end up being data artifacts because they're not reproduced. So I'm not saying that's what's happening here. But again, the overall area under the curve was not different. So to me, that was the biggest take home."

Like, for example, if you have people who are already consuming artificial sweeteners and then you have them consume artificial sweeteners, the likelihood things are going to change is pretty low. Right. So I think that that's a strength. It's also a weakness. And I want to be really careful because I think people took my words a little bit too far, which means I probably didn't do a good job of being nuanced enough. There is the possibility for a placebo effect here. To me, if somebody has gone through that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweeteners, it's likely they have a preconceived notion that those are bad for you because they're difficult to avoid. Yes, it's possible if they're eating a very minimally processed diet, that they're just not exposed to them. And that's very true as well. But the other thing that the researchers acknowledged was they weren't able to blind the study. Because if you've never had an artificial sweetener before, you're only used to regular sugar and you have an artificial sweetener."

But again, I think it's, we can clearly say it's not inert right now how much emphasis we put on that, on a two week study. I'm, I still will say, okay, maybe if you're worried, don't consume sucralose, right. But if you're, you know, 100 pounds overweight and you want to use some sucralose as a replacement to help you lose weight, I would say don't let this study deter you from doing that because the net effect is still going to be more positive than you not losing the weight. Right. So if it's a tool that helps you, fine. But I do hold open the idea that, well, there could be negative effects from it as well. But again, we're looking at, like, what is the overall outcome, right. And then when I looked at, they examined, like, some of the different things that were increased with these different sweeteners. And again, this work gets messy because one of the things they saw was a big increase in butyrate production from the change in the gut microbiome, presumably. Well, as we discussed earlier, butyrate is actually associated with, like, positive outcomes in terms of insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and some other things. So I just, I want to be real cautious before people say, well, there's a change in the microbiome, it must be a bad change. We don't know it's possible. And again, if we have, you know, ten more studies come out and start to show this, then I will start to shift my personal opinion of artificial sweeteners."

And one of the questions that got a lot of upvotes, likes, if you will, was one that I think raises interesting questions about short term and long term health. And it's the following. I think it's a common scenario. A number of people want to know what is the healthiest way to approach a kind of rapid weight loss. And here what I think is happening is somebody has an event coming up, or they're just tired of being the weight they are carrying, the amount of adipose tissue they are, and they wanted to know whether or not it is safe to, for instance, lose three pounds a week for a few weeks in anticipation of a wedding or some other event. And whether or not straight caloric restriction and increasing activity is the best way to approach that, with the understanding that they may gain back a little afterwards, they might. I think ideally they'd like to maintain it afterwards. But what do you think of that sort of approach, cutting caloric intake in half, for instance, and then doubling and also doubling your physical output?"

        "text": "So it's interesting because you might be surprised by what I'm going to say, which is the research data actually tends to suggest that people who are obese, who lose a lot more weight early are more likely to keep it off, which seems a little bit contradictory. Right. Like, well, that doesn't seem very sustainable. But again, you're weighing competing things. So there's sustainability aspect, but then there's also like, buy in is huge for sustainability. Right. So for a lot of overweight or obese people, if they start a diet and they don't see something quickly, they kind of bail on it because it's not working, whereas if they see some rapid results pretty quickly, they buy in even harder. I think the conversation, especially if there's any coaches or trainers out there, is just presenting that as one of my favorite lines, is there are no solutions, there's only trade offs. I think Thomas Sowell said that. So you're having a trade off. Here it is. Yes. You're going to lose fat faster. You might lose lean mass a little bit faster, too, which can be a problem. But I will say the more adipose tissue you have, the more aggressively you can diet without negative consequences. Somebody like me doing a really aggressive diet is not going to be good for my lean mass. One, I have a higher lean mass than normal. Two, I have a lower body fat than normal. As your body fat goes down, the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up. So people who are very obese because they have so much adipose tissue to pull from, there's very little reason for the body to catabolize lean tissue. Now, that being said, if you go on a people misinterpret like, theyre like, well, I got a in body done and or a dexa done and ive lost, you know, two pounds of lean mass and theyve, you know, theyve lost 20 pounds overall. Well, keep in mind, adipose tissue itself is 13% lean mass. So theres actually like, you know, protein component to like the structural component of the adipose tissue. And it does have some water, so its about 87% lipid. But the other part is lean so, at minimum, you should expect a 13% reduction in lean mass when you diet. And then when you consider, like, you lose body water overall, which is registers as lean mass, and you lose, your splatnik tissues can shrink a little bit. So it's normal to lose, you know, for the average person to lose, like, 25 or 30% of the weight that they lose from lean mass, but that doesn't mean skeletal muscle tissue. And again, the more adipose you have, the more aggressively you can approach the diet without really negative long term consequences to lean mass or your overall health. But balance that with okay, if I'm going to do this, I need to understand that I'm not going to be dieting this way forever. I'm doing this to give myself a boost at the beginning, and I have to be okay at some point with transitioning to something that's a little more sustainable."

I just want to briefly mention that when Allie Crumb was on the podcast, she mentioned that they'd been doing a study that I have to pair you to and hear the conversation as a fly on the wall, because what she was telling me was that if people believe that a food is nutritious for them, then eating less of it registers as more satiating. Whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system, you know, like, oh, you know, dieting is hard, and the food sucks and it's terrible, well, then they crave all sorts of other things, whereas they could. They actually observe in their studies where people report reduced craving. If they are told, for instance, a chicken breast and broccoli and some olive oil and rice is actually quite nourishing, it's actually really good for you. Then people eat that, and they feel like they've actually eaten more. The satiety signaling goes up. So it's just a point that Allie made. Those aren't my days."

And for those of you that are listening who are wondering why we're sort of chuckling already, I should mention that both in the Twitter sphere and Instagram and online, there are these very polarized views that probably aren't worth focusing on for too long. But there are a number of folks out there who are arguing that seed oils are the source of all the obesity epidemic, everything. Inflammation, et cetera, illuminati, everything. And then there are those that would argue just the opposite, that meat is the source of all problems, et cetera. And I think we've, thanks to your nuance and expertise. We've hopefully appropriately framed things that it's never that black and white. It's simply not rarely. I love olive oil. I realize that doesn't fit exactly into the seed oil category. I love olive oil. I use it in moderation. I do also consume some butter in moderation, et cetera. But are there any data on seed oils? And here a good example, I think would be like canola oil, which comes from the rape seed that literally was renamed canola oil because rape seed oil is not good marketing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No, no, exactly. So the first thing I'll say is seed oils have negatively contributed to our overall health because people in the last 2030 years, what they have tend to add into their diet that has increased the overall calorie load is oil like these various, mostly from seed oils, but when we look at one to one replacement with other fats. And so if you look at the epidemiology, yeah, you can find some epidemiology showing people who consume more seed oil have more negative health outcomes. Problem is, again, tied up with a multitude of other behaviors. And then you can find mechanisms. And the idea is, well, these have, they're polyunsaturated, which means in the fatty acid chain, there's multiple double bonds, which those double bonds can be oxidized when they're exposed to heat and some other things. And so the idea is, well, when you cook with these things and, you know, they get, they make it oxidized and that's going to cause inflammation in your body. So that's a plausible mechanism. So as always, I defer to the human randomized control trials. And so what you tend to find is when you substitute polyunsaturated fats, or, sorry, when you substitute saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats, it's either neutral or positive in terms of the effects on, like, inflammation is basically neutral. There's some studies that show a positive effect of doing polyunsaturated fats, but it probably depends on the individual polyunsaturated fat. And that's the other thing I don't really is difficult because you're categorizing, like, everything in this one bucket. And there are some differences between individual fatty acids, even with saturated fat. Like, for example, stearic acid doesn't tend to raise ldl cholesterol, whereas saturated fat as a whole tends to raise ldl cholesterol. But there are some saturated fats that don't. So again, it's like we're putting things in buckets and it's a little more nuanced than that. Then if you look at the effects of polyunsaturated fats on markers of cardiovascular disease, again tends to either be a neutral or positive effect when you substitute saturated fat for polyunsaturated fat. Now if you want to get into like monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated, there's some, there's quite a bit of disagreement between the studies. What I would say based on the human randomized control trials is that you're probably better off consuming monounsaturated and polyunsaturated in place of saturated fat. But again, if the idea is well that means poly is unsaturated are good for me. So im just going to dump a bunch of oil on everything and now youre upping your calories. Well thats a negative now right because you have to deal with the bigger problem of overall energy toxicity. So im not somebody who likes to demonize individual nutrients. I just havent seen really compelling evidence that seed oils are the root cause of the problems that are being suggested. And I think this is a good example of kind of like whenever theres something that pops up in the fitness industry theres always the opposite thing that pops up. And its like the reactionary, extreme reaction to whatever this thing was over here. I think thats what were seeing with some of the seed oil stuff is its mostly people who are trying to expose the virtues of saturated fat. And listen, I think its fine to consume some saturated fat, but again, I think limiting it to seven to 10% of your daily calorie intake is probably wise. Again based on all the consensus of the evidence I've seen. And so once again we're struggling with this. Okay, we've got this epidemiology and these mechanisms that sound good, but then what actually happens when we, we do some human randomized control trials and so far I just haven't seen the evidence to suggest that seed oils are independently bad for you independent of the calories they contain."

And thank you for pointing out that most of the data point to the fact that saturated fat should make up about no more than seven to 10% of total daily caloric intake. Is there a lower end threshold that can be problematic? Um, for instance, I've noticed that my blood profiles, especially in terms of hormones, improve when I'm getting sufficient saturated fat. Maybe I'm a mutant, but years ago, because I'm a product of growing up in the nineties, I tried a low fat diet. I. It certainly crushed my androgen levels. I started adding some butter back in, and I was right back in the sweet zone where I wanted to be. So seven to 10% of daily caloric intake, I'm guessing, is probably about what I do now. I'll have to check. But is there a danger to going too low in saturated fats?"

I'm not making that claim specifically, but I think it's important to understand this, that I think we all have this idea. There's this one iconic diet out there that is going to be the best diet for building muscle and burning fat and preventing cancer and heart disease. And the reality is, like, there's overall healthy dietary patterns that we see that are good for those things. But when we get down into the weeds, there's probably some push and pull here as well, right? So when it comes to saturated fat, there is some evidence that if you're too low on it, that, yes, you can have a reduction in testosterone. Now, is that reduction in testosterone, let's say 15, 20%, whatever it may be, is that sufficient to actually cause loss of lean mass? That we don't know. That's never been shown. Interestingly, I just remembered this. There was one study that was comparing polyunsaturated fat versus saturated fat, and they equated total fat. And one of the really interesting things was the group getting the polyunsaturated fat had more lean mass at the end of the study compared to the group getting saturated fat. Now, it's only one study. I've never seen this replicated. So I'm very. This is a situation where I say, I would like to find out what the mechanism of that is, because this could just be random. But if that gets shown over and over, what I might say is, okay, well, what's the. What are we. If polyunsaturated are somehow increasing lean mass compared to saturated fat, who cares what happens with testosterone? Unless that reduction in testosterone is causing some kind of impedance impotence for your life. Right? So all that to say, I don't really know.

        "text": "Yeah. So if you look at the male versus female studies relation to diet, they seem to respond to some similar way, like similar calorie deficit, seems to produce similar results. If you do low carb, high carb, regardless, it seems to boil down to the same principles. Now, training wise, we do know that female, like, the muscle fibers adapt a little bit differently to training, but without getting too far into the weeds, it doesn't really change the way you should train, because for the most part, building muscle, there's a lot of different ways to build muscle. So we know that like, light loads up to maybe like 30 reps, as long as it's taken close to failure, have basically the same effect on building muscle, at least in the short term, as heavy loads. For low reps, it's mostly about taking the muscle close to fatigue or failure. Right. You don't have to go, you don't have to go to failure. But getting close within a few reps, if you're between one rep and 30 reps, if you're getting close to failure, seem to produce similar results. So again, great. You can pick with whichever form of discomfort you prefer. Right. When it comes to female specific training, again, females, actually, this is one thing that a lot of people don't know. They actually put on a similar amount of lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men. In fact, there's no statistically significant difference in the amount of lean mass they put on. Now, the absolute amount of lean mass that's added will be greater for men because they started with a greater amount of lean mass. But the relative increase in lean mass is pretty much the same from similar training. Now, females, there's some differences in, like, fiber types. Females tend to be a little bit less fatigable than men. They can go a little bit harder, a little bit longer, and there's also some evidence that they recover a little bit better. But that also could be simply due to the fact that they're not able to use as heavy of loads to induce hypertrophy. So I kind of have this theory that while, you know, as a percentage of your one rep max, you can program things, I think absolute load matters. When you look at, like, the most elite power lifters, the super heavyweights aren't squatting three or four times a week because, you know, they're squatting 8900 pounds."

But when you get into the lighter weight classes, and this goes for men too, you do see quite a few people who do, you know, many training sessions at high rpes and seem to be able to recover from that. So I do think the absolute load makes a difference. Now, when it comes to, like, menstrual cycle, this is one of those things where I kind of tell people, you know, do what you prefer. So there's some people who have said you should program, you should like, kind of schedule your training around your menstrual cycle, which is whenever you're going through your menstrual cycle, you know, reduce the intensity, reduce the volume, because you're, you know, you're not going to feel as good, you're not going to train as well. What I would say is just auto regulate that. If you go in and you're on your period but you, you feel good and you're doing well that day, then I don't think you necessarily need to back it off. And there, there was one study that kind of supported that notion. But if you go in and you feel terrible and, you know, you feel like you could use, you know, a reduction in intensity and volume, then it's totally fine to autoregulate that. And when I say autoregulation, I'm. Auto regulation means you are regulating the individual training session based on your performance. So I auto regulate insofar as, like, I'm a super nerd. So I have a velocity device so I can actually attach to the bar and see how fast the load moves. And I know at various different, like, warm up weights what velocities I should be hitting. So if I hit my last warmup and my velocity is about 10% higher than usual, I can be pretty confident that that's going to be a good day for me. If it's lower, then I can back it off a little bit. In fact, at worlds, when I hit my last deadlift, it was 30%. My last deadlift warmup, it was 30% faster than I usually hit in the gym. And I turned and looked at my coach and I said, yeah, we're going to get this today. So there's various forms of ways to auto regulate. But again, women, if you're on your period but you feel good, I don't think there's any reason you need to back off. But if you're not feeling good, then it's totally appropriate to back off."

Eggs are this way, meats are this way. People say, well, when you heat protein, you denature it. And I think they hear that word, denature and they think, destroy. And that is not what denature means. So proteins fold up into 3d dimensional structures. You know this, of course, based on their amino acid sequence and their specific energies of those amino acids. When you heat protein or add acid, it starts to unfold that. That protein structure that happens during digestion. Anyway. So I always chuckle when, like the, like, I've seen some companies come out with whey that you can cook with, right? That's not going to, you know, destroy the amino acids. I'm like, so you mean like regular whey, right. So, yeah, cooking, typically cooking actually makes amino acids more bioavailable, not less. Now, I would stay away from charring your meat because there is some evidence that charring creates polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which at least in animals, when they give those, they appear to be carcinogenic. So if you do char your meat by accident, I would just cut off the charred portions and then you should be fine."

What about, um, people referred to them in their questions as carb blockers, but I think what they're referring to are things like Berberine and some of the glucose scavengers. And, um, one glucose scavenger I'd love for you to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk after a meal, or maybe even a slow walk after a meal, some movement, can help, um, downshift the amount of circulating glucose in some way. I've heard that, um, not a lot of people, but. But some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things like berberine or even metformin. Um, can scavenge glucose. I personally can't take berberine. If I take it, I get massive headaches, unless I've ingested tons of sugar and carbohydrates. So I just don't mess around with it. But I. I know there are a number of people out there that want to know whether or not these glucose scavengers can be useful."

        "text": "I think that is really majoring in the minors, if I'm being honest. Um, as far as, like, the carb blockers, there's, like, some white kidney bean extract and those sorts of things. They can. They do block the digestion of carbohydrates some. So when I say block, that's those watching or listening. Metabolism is typically not on and off switches. Okay? So when we say things like block or attenuate or inhibit, typically, we're not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it and everything turns off. We're talking about a dimmer switch. Okay? Like, so you. It just changes the emphasis. But these carb blockers can reduce the absorption of carbohydrate. Now, they don't seem to cause weight loss when you just do it. A normal diet. Now, why is that? Well, all it does is once those carbohydrates get to the large intestine and your bacteria get a hold of them, they start fermenting them to volatile fatty acids, which get reabsorbed into your liver. So you don't get the increase in blood glucose, but you still get almost all the calories from it, because it's just in a different form. So, you know, if carb blockers, if they actually worked really well, I mean, if you block something from being absorbed, your GI typically does not just let undigested material sit in there. You get diarrhea. I mean, that would be the outcome. That's also how I, like, debunk the whole, like, 30 grams of protein at a meal. You can't absorb any more than that. I'm like, if that was the case when you ate a steak, you would just start having diarrhea every time you went over that 30 grams threshold. Right."

        "text": "I remember during college, so this would be early nineties, there was the olestra craze, this idea of putting in non digestible thing into things like potato chips so that it would clear through the GI tract faster, not absorb as many calories it does raise. This went nowhere. Obviously, you don't hear about this anymore, but it does raise an interesting question related to energy balance, which is gastric emptying time. And obviously, in the landscape of eating disorders, in particular, anorexia, abuse of lack use and abusive laxatives is a way in which people will, in an unhealthy way, try and control their weight. And there's a lot of problems with that approach. But what about gastric emptying time? Is this one way that people could control their energy balance in a healthy way? And where does fiber come into play?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Fiber tends to improve GI transit time because it adds bulk. So your GI system is basically a tube, and it has peristalsis, which is wave like contractions that moves the food down through the tube. Well, if you have more bulk to the food, like with fiber, you can move it through a little bit better. Now, in the gastric, the stomach specifically, fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit, probably because it congeals a little bit. Now, this kind of gets into, like, the glycemic index argument, right? Like if you do, if you do like low GI foods, you'll have a slower release of glucose. It's a slower gastric emptying time. Does that affect energy balance? And so there are quite a few studies looking at, like, low Gi versus high GI foods. In the studies where they don't control calories, low GI tends to outperform high Gi. But when they control calories, there's no difference. And so what that tends to, what I think that suggests is low GI foods, just by their nature, tend to be higher in fiber. And so I think it just kind of comes back to the fiber issue."

It's an enormous landscape, but I believe there are a few things that you believe in, meaning they exist and there are decent data to support their use, maybe even some anecdotal data based on your own experience. As long as we highlight it as such, it could be interesting. I've heard you talk about two in particular. One that I'm very familiar with, which is creatine monohydrate. If you could share your thoughts on that, not just for muscle building, but maybe any other purposes for it. And then the other one is one that, frankly, I'm learning more about all the time now thanks to your prompt, which is Ridolia Rosea. I think I pronounced that correctly. And why that might be interesting or of use to people."

        "text": "Yeah. So touching. On creatine, it is the most tested, safe and effective sports supplement we have. I mean, it's just, there are thousands of studies on creatine monohydrate now. And I would say very clearly, too, if you're using any other form of creatine, I think you're wasting your money. Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it. Apparently it's a little more soluble. The claim is that you need less, but there's only a couple studies on it, and it's more expensive."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it's gotten more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues. Even the. There's forms of creatine that appear to be as good, like hydrochloride, but it's more expensive. And then things like creatine ethyl ester has been shown to be worse than creatine. Monohydrate buffered creatine is as good or worse, and it's much more expensive. So I tell people, just take creative monohydrate. It is tried and true. It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatin, and that's what you want. So creatine works through a few different methodologies. One through increasing phosphocreatine content, which helps improve exercise performance. It also appears to improve. It appears to improve recovery, and it increases lean mass, a lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells. But that is. I mean, muscle cells are mostly water. So when people say, well, it's just water, that's what muscle cells mostly are. And it also increases strength and some other metrics. Now, it also has been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage. Now, that's probably because they're getting an increase in lean mass. And so the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage. But there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass as well. I don't think that creatine is a fat burner. I think that people are able to train harder, build more lean tissue, and so that's probably having an effect on fat mass. Then they've actually shown, more recently some cognitive benefits to creatine, which I find really interesting as well. But the only knock on creatine that anybody's been able to come up with because they've debunked the kidney stuff, they've debunked the liver stuff. There's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney, kidney or liver, is hair loss. So what about hair loss? Because there was one study in 2009 that showed that creatine increased DHT, but they didn't really show an effect on any other sex hormone. So it's kind of strange. Like you would think if there was an increase in DHT, there would be like something else that changes as well. And it's only one study, and again, didn't directly measure hair loss, measured DHT, which we know is involved in the loss of the follicule, the follicle. So what I would say is that I am not convinced. It's only one study, never been replicated to my knowledge, and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome. So, uh, if you, if you're somebody who's prone to hair loss and you want to avoid creatine because of that, I understand. But for most people, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's something to worry about."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So again, no solutions, only trade offs. You can load it and you will saturate your phosphocreatin stores faster, like usually within a week. If you just take 5 grams per day, it'll take two, three, four weeks, but you will get to the same place and youre a probably going to have a much lower risk of GI issues. Some people creatine can be a gut irritant. If it is for some folks, I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses. So maybe like multiple to one or two gram doses per day and definitely don't load it if you're somebody who has GI issues from it. As far as Rhodiola Rosea, the research is still in its infancy. I was just reading a new systematic review that kind of concluded that we need more high quality research. But the research that is out there seems to suggest that not only does it reduce physical fatigue, but also reduces the perception of fatigue and may also enhance memory and cognition as well. And it's referred to as an adaptogen. So I really like it. My anecdotal experience is when I combine that with caffeine, it tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffeine. It's a more pleasant experience. And theres also some evidence that if youre like coming off caffeine, that it can reduce the, uh, the negative side effects to caffeine withdrawal, which, by the way, I didnt really believe in that until I actually did a cold turkey. Uh, so before a meat, ill cut out caffeine for seven days because you can basically reset your caffeine tolerance in seven days. And like two days in, I mean, Im groggy, ive got the headaches. Usually I'll get like body aches that come up because caffeine is actually a mild analgesic. Um, and yeah, so it was very interesting to say, but I slept like a baby, I'll tell you that."

There was a new meta analysis that showed that citrulline malate can reduce fatigue and increase, I think, time to fatigue. And it may actually have some small recovery benefits as well.

But like you said, you're just used to it. So there's those things. Then you've got things like beta alanine, which it's in our pre workout, probably not super helpful for most people for resistance training. It does seem to have some benefits for, like, high intensity. Like, if you get out, you know, more than like, 45 seconds or 60 seconds of, like, really hard training, it does appear to help with delaying fatigue for that. And then you've got things like betaine or also called trimethylglycine, which there's some evidence it can improve lean mass. There's some evidence that it can improve power output. So there's a few things out there, but most of the stuff is not very good. So I think that those kinds of supplements, very useful. But again, I would never tell people they need supplements again. Even something like creatine is going to be a very small effect compared to proper nutrition recovery and hard training. You know, one of the things I was, I was talking with Ben Bruno the other day, and I said, you know, like, some people will ask me, like, how does this person make progress? Because, you know, their programming is, you know, it's not evidence based. Or this guy, how's he like? His exercises are dumb. And I'll say, yeah, but they train really hard for 20 years. Like, you know, one commonality you see between, like, really successful athletes or bodybuilders is they train really hard. And one of the things I have observed is the more into the weeds people tend to get. And again, this is just my own anecdote and observation. The more into the weeds they tend to get, the less hard I see them train. And so one of the things I really like that Mike Ezriatel said, who's got a PhD and is a bodybuilder himself, he said, you can't outscience hard training. That if you're looking to build muscle and you're looking to improve your body composition, the main thing is just doing."

Learning to really enjoy training hard, in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well, not just for the effects that it has on body composition. Excuse me, those two, of course, but just learning to really enjoy the process of training hard and a really hard workout or a really hard paper that you have to sort through or really digging through a book that's challenging, learning to really enjoy that, I think, is a, if there is a power tool out there, it's the psychological end."

How do I become more confident? And I'll tell people, you have to do. There's no hack. You can't read about it. You got to get in the arena. And I don't mean, like, compete in sports necessarily, but like doing a PhD or doing something, just something hard where you're putting yourself out there and you're saying, this is my goal and I'm going to go for it, but you just learn so much by doing that about yourself. And so just what you said, I will reframe things in my mind when bad things happen from. It's not to say I never get stressed out. Cause I do. And it's not to say that I never get down because I do, because I'm a human. But when something bad happens, I actually post about this in my store today. When something bad happens, I very rarely anymore do I go, woe is me. Why did this happen to me? Because you're in the universe. Random bad things are going to happen. So instead I say, if I'm not dead, instead I say, well, what an exciting opportunity to overcome an obstacle. And I bet because in the experience of my life, the biggest lessons and the best things in my life have actually come out of the most challenging, worst things that have happened. And so, again, this is, I would never have been able to do these sorts of things if I hadn't taken up weightlifting, because weightlifting taught me so much about perseverance, delayed gratification, overcoming obstacles.

And then what were some of the key things that you wanted to make sure sure were in there when you built it? Like, whats the sort of logical backbone behind it? Because I think there are a lot of food counting, calorie counting exercise apps out there. Everyone ive talked to that uses carbon, including our mutual friend cigar and Getty. This member of my podcast, et cetera, raves about it. So what is carbon and what does it do? And what was your mindset in building it? What did you really want to see there that you didnt see elsewhere?"

        "text": "So those listening may not know, but I really, I started online coaching people for nutrition back in 2005, and that was the vast majority of my business all the way up until, like, 2017. And I had a lot of success with that, whether it be just average folks looking to lose weight or build muscle, and right up to elite level competitors in physique sport. So I kind of had this idea. Like, I don't want to say I had the idea. A few people had the idea, what if we could take what I do in coaching and try to automate as much of that as possible? Because, you know, by the time I was becoming a really popular coach, I mean, I was expensive. You know, you were looking at, like, you know, me charging. I got to the point where I was charging about $1,000 a month for coaching, right? And not, most people cannot afford that. And I would like to not just coach rich people, you know what I mean? I would like to be able to help other people. So the idea was to create an app that could do some of this stuff. Now, there's always a place for human interaction, but for people who can't afford that, our app is basically $10 a month. And basically what we wanted to do was set up an app wherever. Think about if you went to a nutrition coach, what would they do? They would probably ask you some questions about your goals, take some anthropometrics, and they would use, like, that information, maybe dietary preference, and they'd use that information to kind of formulate a baseline plan. That's what carbon does. So we ask you, I think there's eight questions in the sign up flow about, like, your activity, your exercise, your lifestyle, your body weight, your body fat percentage. And if you don't know it, we help you calculate it. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. And then your dietary preferences, and we use that to come up with kind of your baseline. And your baseline will be, you know, your calories, your protein, your carbohydrates and fats. And what's different about our app? Because, like, apps like, you know, myfitnesspal or whatever will do that as well. What's different about ours is we encourage people to log their weight daily for the reasons that we talked about earlier. And then you can also track your food in the app. And honestly, I think our food tracker is actually way easier to use than most of them out there. What we typically get great rave reviews about is how user friendly our interface is, that it makes intuitive sense. You track your food, try to hit these macros that you're prescribed, and each week you will be prompted to check in with the coach on your check in day, and then you put in some information, and then based on how you're progressing, the app will adjust, or not adjust based on how you're progressing. So, for example, if you're hitting a weight loss plateau, it will sense that and it will reduce your calories. Or if you're trying to gain weight and, you know, hit a plateau, it'll increase your calories. And there's a lot of backend algorithm stuff that takes care of this. But the fundamental crux of the app is we try to determine your total daily energy expenditure, because that's going to tell us the first big thing we need to know, which is how many calories do you need to be eating for your goal. Right. So on the front end, we basically do our best guess based on your. Anthropometrics. Not gonna be perfect, but it'll get us in the ballpark. And if you do know, like some people already know, well, I know what I maintain my body weight on. There's actually a spot where you can manually enter that during the signup flow. So that's helpful for people who are super nerds like me. But then, if you're just. People will ask, well, do you. Do you take Apple Watch data? Do you take this? Do you take that? And no, for the reasons we talked about that, it. Overdose overestimates energy expenditure. What our app does is it's an algebra equation. If you. Because your body weight, your maintenance calories is your total daily energy expenditure, your average calories that you eat to maintain your body weight will be the same as your total daily energy expenditure. So if we know how body weight is changing and we know how many calories the person's consuming, we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is. You can see in the app that there's a maintenance calorie tracker, or energy expenditure tracker. Typically after about three to four weeks, even if the app was off at first, it will have you pretty darn close, because let's say somebody comes on and their goal is to lose a pound and a half a week or something like that, and the first week they lose three pounds. Now the app actually accounts for the fact that you can lose more water weight the first week, so they probably wouldn't get an adjustment. But let's say the next week they lose three pounds. The app will sense that and adjust their calories up because it will be estimating that their energy expenditures are actually higher than what it had previously estimated based on the amount of weight they're losing. And the same thing goes in reverse. If they're not losing the amount of weight that they're supposed to, it will lower them based on the fact that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure. But that's the first crux of it, is tracking that energy expenditure. And then the next thing is protein. So when the back end algorithm stuff is happening, calories are set first based on your energy expenditure and your goal. So for example, if you have, if you're on an aggressive diethouse, your calories are going to be lower, even if your energy expenditure might be a little bit high, just because if you're trying to lose two pounds a week, I mean, you're going to be in a pretty aggressive calorie deficit. So it's going to set the calories first, then it will set protein based on your lean body mass. Then the calories that are left over will be allotted to carbohydrate and fat, depending on your dietary preference. And we have a few different dietary preferences. There's balanced, which is about 50 50 to 60 40 carbohydrate to fat. Of the remaining calories. Then you have low fat, which is obviously a higher ratio of carbohydrate. You have low carb, you have a ketogenic diet, which is very, very low carb. And then there's also a plant based option. And within each of those options still, you can go in and actually shimmy the macros a little bit within a certain range so that you can kind of dial in what your specific dietary preference is. Because again, if we go back to what is going to produce the best long term results, it's whatever the person can adhere to. So we really try to start with the concept of adherence by allowing people to have the dietary preference that they want. And there's some other apps out there that are good apps. Like, for example, we get asked a lot, what's the difference in our app and the Renaissance periodization app. And they have a great app, but theirs is kind of more rigid. And it'll say, you know, you're going to eat this many meals and you're going to have these foods at these times. So we're kind of the opposite. We want to give you maximum flexibility. Now, for some people, they would prefer the rigid structure at first, but we find that for most people, giving them more flexibility typically improves adherence over the long run. So that's kind of how the app works. And again, like, there's multiple different goals. It's not just a weight loss app, there's a maintenance, there's a muscle building. So you've got all kinds of different goals that can be accommodated, different rates of each of those goals. And I mean, I've used the app for over three years now to do my body weight. And I mean, like when I say that, it's dialed me in because I'm very regimented with, you know, logging and, and logging my weight. So what I targeted to weigh in at worlds, I got down to the 0.1 kilogram. So it was pretty cool to be able to like use a tool that I helped develop to actually coach me. So it's a great tool. You know, we did some statistics. We polled 2500 members and one of the questions we asked is, would you recommend this to a friend? And 91% said yes. So I think our average retention is like seven months, which for an app that costs $10 a month is really great."

And what we know about the human brain is that winging it can work, but that the brain will cheat itself often. There's a Feynman quote about this, and I'll get it wrong, always bad to try and quote Feynman anyway because he said it so much better, but that we are the easiest. It's easy to fool ourselves, basically. Is what he was saying easiest to fool ourselves?"

It sounds like a wonderful tool and a tool that nets a lot of the principles that sit as major themes for weight loss. Weight gain, I would assume directed lean muscle, lean tissue, gain is what most people are after and weight maintenance because a number of people would like to just maintain. Listen, I really appreciate your time and all that you're doing, certainly your time and energy and knowledge today, but also what you're doing on the various social media channels. And just the fact that somebody from the depths of academia is out there sharing so much knowledge across so many domains. You're a gem in this landscape of nutrition and one that people really need to hear from. So thank you so much for your time."
