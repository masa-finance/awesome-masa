        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Doctor Robert Lustig. Doctor Robert Lustig is an endocrinologist. That is, he's a specialist in the function of hormones in the body and a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. He has authored more than 100 peer reviewed studies exploring how different types of nutrients, that is, food, impact our cellular functioning, our organ functioning, and thereby our health. During today's discussion, we discussed the idea of whether or not a calorie is indeed a calorie, and whether or not our body weight and body composition only reflects the number of calories we eat versus the calories that we burn. We talk about how different food types, that is, how the different macronutrients, protein, fat, and carbohydrates are processed in the body and the important role that fiber and the gut microbiome plays in that process. And we pay particular attention to the topic of how different types of sugars, and fructose in particular, can indeed be addictive to the brain and can modify the way that hormones in the body, in particular insulin, impact our liver health, kidney health, and indeed the health of all of our cells and organs. Indeed, doctor Lustig is an expert in how sugar impacts the brain and body. We talk about how certain types of sugars can indeed be addictive in the same way that certain drugs of abuse and behaviors can become addictive. So, in other words, how sugar actually changes the way that the brain works. And we discuss how the food industry, that is, the commoditization and sale of particular types of food, has altered the way that we eat and indeed, the foods that we crave. Today's discussion covers all of that. And by the end of today's discussion, you'll have a thorough understanding of how foods are processed when they enter your body, and how those different food choices are impacting your immediate and long term health. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try elemt, you can go to drink element. That's lmnt.com Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com Huberman Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditations since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga, Nidra, and something similar to it called non sleep, deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with doctor Robert Lustig. Doctor Robert Lustig, welcome."

And we'll start off simply talking about what most everyone believes and understands, which is that a calorie is a form of heat energy that's given off during the processing of some food bit or something. If that's mysterious to people, just understand that a calorie is a unit of energy. And I was taught, and still many, many people worldwide believe that a calorie is a calorie, meaning if I consume more calories in whatever form, then I metabolize by thinking, feeling, moving, exercising, etcetera, then I will gain weight. And if I consume fewer calories than I burn, I will lose weight. And we could talk a lot about where that weight loss comes from. Does it come from adipose, body fat stores, or from muscle? Or from protein? Or muscle, of course, is protein, et cetera. But let's start off with, is a calorie truly a calorie when it comes to the processing of different types of calories?"

        "text": "Everyone thinks that obesity is about energy balance. That is, calories in, calories out, therefore two gluttony and sloth. Therefore, if you're fat, it's your fault. Therefore, diet and exercise, therefore, any calorie can be part of a balanced diet. Therefore, don't pick on our calories. Go pick on somebody else's calories. This is actually what the food industry uses to assuage their culpability for the change in the food supply and the rise in obesity and chronic disease like diabetes. Now, it is true that a calorie is that unit of energy that raises 1 gram of water one degree centigrade. And so therefore, a calorie burned is a calorie burned. I don't argue that that's true. That's the first law of thermodynamics. But that doesn't mean a calorie eaten is a calorie eaten. That's not the same. And that's where people get it wrong. So let me give you some examples of how that calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten. You like almonds?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No. Turns out the fiber in those almonds, both soluble and insoluble fiber. And by the way, fiber is sort of the key to the kingdom in this story. It forms a gel on the inside of your intestine. The insoluble fiber, the cellulose, forms a fishnet, if you will. A lattice work on the inside of your duodenum, the soluble fiber, which are globular, plug the holes in that fishnet. Together they form a secondary barrier. You can actually see it on electron microscopy, a whitish gelatinous. And that prevents absorption of those 30 calories. So, yes, 130 get absorbed, but many of them don't. They end up going further down the intestine to the next part, called the jejunum. And that's where the microbiome is. Now. Everyone knows about the microbiome nowadays. It's all the bacteria. We always say when women are pregnant, you're eating for two. Well, we're always eating for 100 trillion. Now they have to eat. Well, what do they eat? They eat what you eat. The question is how much did you get versus how much did they get? Well, if you ate almonds, they're getting those 30 calories. So even though you count the calories at your lips, that doesn't matter. What really matters is counting the calories at your intestinal brush border, okay? And they're not the same. So if you feed your gut, that's a good thing, because then your gut will take those calories and turn it into things like short chain fatty acids, which end up being protective against chronic metabolic disease. Acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, those are actually good. They're anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's, because you fed your microbiome. So even though you ate 160, you absorbed 130. So a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten because if you ate it with fiber, it wasn't for you, it was for your bacteria. But that's not the way you count them up. So that's problem number one. Problem number two, amino acids. So we all eat protein. Let's say you eat too much protein. You had the Porterhouse steakhouse. Now, if you're a bodybuilder, those amino acids might go to muscle, and you might increase your muscle mass because you're a bodybuilder, because you're putting excess force on those muscles and you're growing those muscles. Okay, but let's say you're not a bodybuilder. Let's say you're a mere mortal like me."

You've taken on all these amino acids. There's no place to store it other than muscle. So your liver takes the excess and deamidates that amino acid, takes the amino group off to turn it from an amino acid into an organic acid. And then that organic acid can then enter the krebs cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle. What goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate ATP, the chemical energy that your body needs in order to power itself. Okay, now that's a good thing. It takes double the amount of energy to prepare that amino acid for burning as it does to prepare a carbohydrate for burning or fruit or."

Let's make it realistic for a really nice big porterhouse steak, which I love, by the way. Let's say. Let's say 800 calories. Well, it turns out how much of that is. So that's what goes in your mouth? My mouth? How much of it is actually eaten to stay with your calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten in the processing of that, what percentage actually goes into your total caloric intake?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So about 10% of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperature. It's called the thermic effect of food. But when you're eating protein, you actually generate more. And the reason is because it takes two ATP to phosphorylate that organic acid as opposed to one ATP to phosphorylate that carbohydrate for consumption. So you actually have a net loss of energy because it was an amino acid versus a monosaccharide, a sugar. Now you brought up fat. Fat doesn't need to be phosphorylated. So it actually doesn't have any thermic effect of food at that point. So depends on what it is as to whether or not you have loss."

Heart healthy, anti inflammatory, anti Alzheimer's, save your life. And over here we have trans fats, the devil incarnate consumable poison. Because you can't break the trans double bond, you don't have the desaturase to break that trans double bond. So it basically accumulates lines your arteries, lines your liver, causes chronic metabolic disease, causes insulin resistance. Omega three s don't even get broken down for energy because they're so important. They stay intact because your brain needs them, your heart needs them. Whereas trans fats can't be broken down because of that trans double bond. One save your life, other one kill you. They're both nine calories per gram. If you explode them in a bomb, calorimeter. Because a calorie burned is a calorie burned. But a calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten, because one will save your life, one will kill you. And finally, the big kahuna, the one that blows everything else out of the water. Fructose and glucose."

So we can dispense with that unless you have a disease called galactosemia, which is about one in 20,000 and causes neonatal meningitis. And, you know, it's a disease, as a pediatric endocrinologist, I would take care of. But we can dispense with that for the moment. All right, so, glucose, fructose. Glucose is the energy of life. Every cell on the planet burns glucose for energy. Glucose is so damn important that if you don't consume it, your body makes it. So it will take an amino acid and turn it into glucose."

So the inuit, they didn't have any place to grow carbohydrate. They had ice, they had whale blubber. They still have serum glucose level. And the reason is because you had to, you have to have a serum glucose level in order to power your brain, in order to power your heart. Yes, you can use ketones. Of course you can. But only if you're in a ketogenic state will you use exclusively ketones. And you also need glucose for structural changes in specific proteins and particularly hormones. So glucose molecules will stud tsH LH, FSH different pituitary hormones in order to increase their potency. It's one of the reasons why aging leads to defective hormonogenesis. For instance, hypogonadism. Hypothyroidism is the loss of glycosylation on individual peptide hormones. Because of the inability to add glucose because of insulin. It's an aging phenomenon."

Fructose, on the other hand, this sweet molecule, the molecule we seek, the reason why the food industry studs every food in the grocery store. 73% of all items in the american grocery store have added sugar on purpose. For the food industry's purpose is not for yours. Because fructose is addictive, activates the nucleus, accumbens the reward center of the brain, in the same way that cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol do and drives dopamine receptors down, just like nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, heroin do that molecule. Fructose is, number one, completely vestigial to all vertebrate life. There is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate that requires dietary fructose. That's number one. Number two."

Turns out fructose inhibits three, count them, three separate enzymes necessary for normal mitochondrial function. Mild, your mitochondria make ATP. Your mitochondria have to work at peak efficiency. That's what metabolic health is. Is mitochondria working at peak efficiency? Well, there are three enzymes that are inhibited by fructose. Number one, amp kinase. Now, amp kinase is the fuel gauge on the liver cell. It's the thing that tells the liver to make more mitochondria, fresher mitochondria, because if your amp levels are high, that means you've dephosphorylated a bunch of atps and you have to regenerate them. So you need some more mitochondria. So it's a negative feedback pathway. Well, you need that Amp kinase to generate that mitochondrial biogenesis signal. Except that fructose, a metabolite of fructose called methylglyoxyl mgo sits in the active site of the gamma subunit of that amp kinase and actually binds to arginines in that active site, rendering that enzyme now dead. It's an irreversible inhibition because of the covalent bonding of that methylglyoxyl, that aldehyde to the arginine. And now that enzyme is dead."

Carnitine is the shuttle mechanism by which you get the fatty acids from the outer mitochondrial membrane through to the inner mitochondrial membrane so that they can be beta oxidized for energy.

The reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com Huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera.

He asked the question, how come cancer cells don't need oxygen to grow? And the answer is, because no cell needs oxygen to grow. In fact, oxygen is the thing that prevents growth.

Now that mucin is a polysaccharide, and the bacteria can use that mucin layer for its own purposes, it will eat your mucin layer. If you don't feed your bacteria. You must feed your bacteria or your bacteria will feed on you. Okay, so you are in concert with your microbiome. If you deprive your microbiome of the food that it needs, it will use you as its food.

I'm not strict about this, the eleven versus noon thing, and probably eat my last bite of food somewhere around 08:00 p.m. and occasionally it's outside that window. I've done this for a long time. It just feels best to me. But other people use a shorter eating window. One thing that I learned from a colleague at Yale who studies the gut microbiome that was surprising to me is that when you eat in that way, there's a long stretch of time, sometimes longer, for people that have a shorter eating window, longer fasting window, that is where you're actually eating up your own intestinal lining. So this idea that fasting is so great for us, on the one hand, might be true. On the other hand, you're actually consuming components of your, you're not feeding your gut microbiome and you deplete it. But here's where I was positively surprised. When you do eat, provided that you eat a enough fiber, and in particular high quality fermented foods, low sugar fermented foods, it seems that the lining of the gut and the gut microbiome is replenished to a level that is greater than if you had eaten for longer periods of the 24 hours cycle.

And we actually have the demographic, the mechanistic, the imaging, and also the economic data to demonstrate that sugar is addictive and the food industry knows it. So have you ever heard of a phenomenon called price elasticity? Okay, price elasticity is an economic term that is used to ask the question, if the price of a given good goes up by 1%, that should result in reduction in purchase or consumption. Because price influences consumption, how much does it influence it? So if something's price elastic, when the price goes up, consumption goes down. Equivalently, a food that is price elastic. The most price elastic food is eggs. So when the price of eggs goes up 1%, consumption of eggs goes down 0.68%, meaning that eggs have a price elasticity of 0.32. Got it?"

And if you're a rational actor, you should be able to say, yeah, I'll buy that, but I won't buy that. Right. Okay. In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman described the irrational actor. Now, the irrational actor cannot determine value, and the reason is because he is risk averse. So the cost is always too great. So the utility may be the same, but the cost goes up because that's why they have aversive tendencies. The irrational actor Jeffrey Sachs has described the hedonic actor who also cannot determine value because it doesn't matter what it costs. They need their fix.

This is a phenomenon that the food industry uses called water activity. And so it will hold on to water, and so it will stay spongy and it will not stale as quickly as the bakery store bread, which did not have that sugar added to it.

Sucrose is what you put in your coffee. It's the crystals. It's cane sugar, beet sugar, the stuff that teaspoons of. This was all that was available for many, many years. That is one molecule of glucose, one molecule of fructose bound together, for the chemists out there, an oglycosidic linkage. The enzyme in your intestine, called sucrase, cleaves this oglycosidic linkage in about a nanosecond. You absorb the two molecules separately. The glucose goes to the entire body, generates an insulin response. The fructose goes straight to your liver, generates fat. That's sucrose. High fructose corn syrup is essentially one molecule of glucose, one molecule of fructose not bound together. No o glycosidic linkage. So they're free. The enzyme sucrase doesn't care because the bond's already broken. Ultimately, they do the same thing. And that's why high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are indistinguishable metabolically. What they are is they're very different economically. And the reason is because high fructose corn syrups half the price of sucrose. Because sucrose we get from importing and high fructose corn syrup we make at home. Sucrose is in bags. High fructose corn syrup is in barrels. Sucrose you can sell at the store. High fructose corn syrup you sell to the ultra processed food manufacturer. You can't buy high fructose corn syrup at the grocery store. They're very different in terms of what they're used for. High fructose corn syrup is particularly egregious because it's so miscible because it's already a liquid. So you probably remember chips ahoy, cookies in the old days, okay.

Why is it that more people don't know about know this information, although many more will know after today's conversation? But, and certainly in government, it's a mix. Regardless of what side of the aisle you're on or if you're right, in between, there are clearly people that care about the health of themselves and others. So I can understand how things might have gotten to this point. But what do you think are the barriers to getting people to appreciate just what a problem this is and getting people to change their choices in terms of what they're eating? Are they truly addicted to the point where they are sick? They can't make good decisions.

Tobacco ultimately needs a public health response because the sheer enormity of it and the egregiousness of it requires that public health response. Well, turns out this is no different. In order to exercise personal responsibility, four criteria have to be met. Those four criteria are the following. Number one, knowledge. You have to have the knowledge, because if you don't have the knowledge, then how can you exercise personal responsibility? Well, in fact, the public's being kept from the knowledge.

Now let's do growth. My colleague, Doctor Efrat Moncinego Ornan, who is the chairman of nutrition at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, actually looked at this question and showed that ultra processed food actually inhibits growth. It inhibits cortical bone growth, it inhibits trabecular bone growth, it inhibits cancellous bone growth, it inhibits linear bone growth, it hijacks growth for cancer because it inhibits mitochondria.

Was I just, since I'm not a dietitian, nutritionist or anything, I just say, eat meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits.

And they lose anywhere from 30 to 55 pounds and keep it off and they're like, hey, this is great. I can actually still eat ribeye steaks and salads, but they're not eating croutons. And so in some sense, it looks extreme. It sounds ketogenic, but it's nothing like that. You're just saying, basically, stay away from. You're eliminating processed foods, you're eliminating liquid calories in general, and on and on. And so there's nothing sophisticated about it. And my question to you is, how much of that weight loss effect do you think is a calories in versus calories out effect? Because they're eating a lot of food, and in some cases.

        "text": "It's nothing to do with the calories. It has everything to do with the insulin. If you get the insulin down, you're not shunting energy to fat. You can lose weight. Your fat will give up the triglycerides stored in it as soon as your insulin goes down. Insulin is pushing on your fat cell all the time. And as long as your insulin's up, your fat cell can't release it. The minute your insulin goes down, you can now engage in what we call lipolysis. Hormone sensitive lipase is an enzyme in the fat cell that is inhibited by insulin. As soon as the insulin is gone, hormone sensitive lipase can turn that stored triglyceride into free fatty acids and glycerol and release it, and you can lose weight. So get the insulin down, and it all works. So the question is, what makes insulin go up? Well, two things, refined carbohydrate and sugar. Those are the two things that make insulin go up. In addition, branched chain amino acids make insulin go up as well. Leucine, isoleucine, valine, which is in corn fed beef, chicken, and fish. Processed food. All right, here's the deal. In one concept, my colleague, Doctor Carlos Montero, who is a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo, has done the world a great service. He has developed a system for categorization of food processing. It is called the Nova system. Just means new. But he has basically categorized every food anywhere in the world into one of four classes. The easiest way to explain this would be an example. Let's take an apple. Nova class one would be an apple picked off a tree. Nova class two would be apple slices, de stemmed, deseeded, deskinned, maybe. Nova class three would be applesauce, cooked, macerated, possibly a preservative. Added maybe some extra sugar, maybe not. Nova class four would be a McDonald's apple pie.

It has no activity whatsoever. From there, 25 hydroxyvitamin D can be metabolized one of two ways. It can either be one alpha hydroxylated in the kidney to the active form, one alpha 125 dihydroxy vitamin D, which will then do all of the business of vitamin D, such as calcium absorption from the gut, suppression of the immune system at the toll like receptor four."

It can be 24 hydroxylated in inflammatory tissue like tuberculosis, sarcoid, gut inflammation. And so you will end up taking your 25 hydroxy D, which is a pro hormone, and turning it into the inactive 24, 25 dihydroxyd, which then just gets excreted out. So in other words, you consumed all this vitamin D and it didn't go where you needed it to go.

There is definitely a value to statins, but not for primary prevention. But that's what every doctor is doing. Oh, your ldl, it's over 80, you need a statin. That's ridiculous. That is absolutely a joke. And the data show that, in fact, my colleague Asim Malhotra in the UK participated in an analysis where they took the entire UK population and they took out everybody under age 65. So looking at people 65 to 90, and it turned out that the LDL level correlated with longevity. The higher the ldl, the longer they lived when you took out all the people who had problems. So LDL is not really the problem. And the reason is because there are two ldls. There's one called large buoyant, there's one called small dense. Turns out dietary fat raises your large buoyant. Your large buoyant is irrelevant. It is cardiovascularly neutral. But that's the one that statins affects. The small dense, that's the atherogenic particle.

And my understanding of the anti smoking campaign, at least for kids, for people 18 and younger, was that telling people it was bad for their health didn't work. Showing them lungs that were decrepit didn't work. What worked was showing them commercials of cackling, hand writhing white guys who were talking about how much money they were making off of these naive kids who were buying cigarettes and other tobacco products.

The fat vacuole gets bigger, bigger, bigger. The perilipin border that encompasses that fat vacuole that borders the space ultimately can't get any bigger, and it starts breaking down. When that happens, it spills the grease into the fat cell. The fat cell dies, becomes necrotic, that calls macrophages in to clean up the grease. And it's the macrophages that release the cytokines. All right? In fact, the fat cell is not the problem. It's the breakdown of the grease that leads to the macrophage activation that's the problem.

So alcohol and sugar, most metabolically egregious because it affects the liver directly, stress second most because it affects the visceral fat and subcutaneous fat, the least important in terms of metabolic derangement. So, yes, it may not look good in the bathing suit, but from a metabolic standpoint, it is actually the least important. So the question then becomes, all right, what are you trying to fix?

The insulin response from the food and the insulin response from the diet soda are compounded, but there's a classical conditioning effect, Pavlovian effect, such that then later, if they just drink the diet soda, they get an even bigger insulin response just to the diet soda than they would have originally if they only had the diet soda separate from food. So in other words, the food induced insulin response is conditioning a greater insulin response from the diet soda."

And each time, they started the morning fasting, and they did either a sucrose tolerance test or an aspartame tolerance test or a sucralose tolerance test or a monk fruit tolerance test. So 2 hours, you know, ingesting one of the three. One of the four. And measuring glucose and insulin over the course of the next 2 hours."

And I said, I'd be happy to do that. With one proviso. We get to publish what we did so that it can serve as a roadmap for the rest of the food industry. And they said, fine. And so I convened a scientific advisory team with my colleague, Wolfram Alderson, who started the very first farmers market in Los Angeles and is now actually the director of sustainability and nutrition for KDD. Tim Harlan, who is the head of culinary medicine at George Washington University. Rachel Gao, who is a fatty acid expert who ran the omega three for add trial at the NIH, and Andreas Kornstadt, who's actually a computer scientist from Stanford. And we basically stripped down every single thing that KDD did in terms of procurement, in terms of ingredients, in terms of packaging. We submitted every single ingredient to biochemical analysis because you couldn't trust what the vendors were basically telling KDD was in the food. We had to actually know what was in the food, and that was a half a million dollars all by itself. I mean, this was not a cheap little sojourn into the woods. This was a big deal. We basically re engineered their entire 180 item portfolio, and they have now turned over 10% of their products to be metabolically healthy. And the precepts that we set in this paper, which is in frontiers in nutrition, in March of this year, 2023, three things, three principles. If you adhere to these three principles, you can turn any food healthy, including ultra processed food. Number one, protect the liver. Number two, feed the gut. Number three, support the brain.

Number four, got to do something about the emulsifiers, because the emulsifiers are causing the gut inflammation. Because, after all, emulsifiers are detergents. They hold fat and water together.

There are two reasons that this happens. One is insulin, because insulin blocks leptin, signaling at the level of the hypothalamus and the nucleus accumbens. So if it blocks leptin, leptin is the hormone that your fat cells make that tells your brain you've had enough. So if insulin blocks leptin, it makes you hungrier, and it also stops the extinguishing of reward. Buy that food so that you want more of it. So it does both, because leptin normally suppresses food intake and reduces craving."

There's no such thing as dopamine inhibiting a post synaptic neuron. Dopamine stimulates the next neuron, and it doesn't matter which dopamine receptor it is. One through five. It's always excitatory. Now, neurons like to be excited. That's why they have receptors. But neurons like to be tickled, not bludgeoned. Chronic overstimulation of any neuron and, you know, this leads to neuronal cell death. And the reason is because the neuron needs energy. The neuron is the most energy dependent tissue in the body. It needs those mitochondria to be pumping out ATP like crazy to engage in neurotransmission. Well, when you're firing nonstop, you risk cell death. So the excitatory neuron, the postsynaptic neuron, has a plan b. It down regulates the receptor. It down regulates the dopamine receptor. So there's less chance that any stray dopamine molecule will find a receptor to bind to. And this is its plan b in order to try to mitigate the risk of dying. Well, what does that mean in human terms? It means you get a hit, you get a rush, receptors go down. Next time, you need a bigger hit to get the same rush, and receptors go down, and you need a bigger hit and a bigger hit and a bigger hit, until finally you need a huge hit to get nothing. That's called tolerance. And then when the neurons do start to die, that's called addiction. That's what we've got. And that's what's happened in terms of food addiction. So the question is, what's addictive? Is fat addictive? No. Because if fat was addictive, then all the people on the Atkins diet or on the ketogenic diet would be gaining weight, not losing it, and I'd be."

Overall body weight is a risk factor for a number of things, and there will be savings on the back end as a consequence of that weight loss. So that's the checkers version. The chess version is how you're describing it. And I think that, I mean, clearly people in government are. Well, most. Some perhaps are smart enough to play chess, not checkers, or to at least understand it. But there's very little incentive for the chess model. What would, quote unquote, solve this problem is the same thing that happened to fen fen or this romanovant, which is if suddenly there's a major issue with the drug, then everyone stops taking it, and traditionally, that's how it's gone.

I mean, we know there are these somatotopic maps of self, but that the neural machinery in the hypothalamus, sure, which is responsible for motivated states, etcetera, but also just the entire mapping of the self changes. In other words, if one is fat long enough that it becomes increasingly hard to get to a healthy weight because of the way that the neural circuitry is impacted, it basically remaps to maintain that fat person, not necessarily even just at the level of appetite, but just in terms of what do big animals do? I had a bulldog that weighed 90 pounds. Bulldog mastiff. He was very economical with his movement. Right. He was extremely powerful. He could run at least when he was younger.

If you are leptin sensitive, you are happy to burn. If you are leptin resistant, your brain thinks you're starving. And if your brain thinks you're starving, it's going to affect your behavior in two ways. It's going to make you want to eat, and it's also going to make you want to conserve, because the goal is to try to increase the leptin levels in order to overcome that resistance, which, of course, you can never do because all you're going to do is lay down more fat and make more leptin."

Insulin inhibits leptin signaling, and it does it at three separate places in the pomsine neuron, the pro opium melanocortinous neuron in the hypothalamus. It does it at IRS two, insulin receptor substrate two. It does it at sox three, suppressor of cytokine signaling. Three, and it does it at pip three, phosphatidyl inosital triphosphate. Those three separate arms of the leptin receptor are all basically put to sleep by high insulin. Insulin blocks leptin signaling. So the higher the insulin goes, the more your brain thinks you're starving. And the more your brain thinks you're starving, the hungrier you get and the less you want to move. So the gluttony and sloth that we've been talking about all in a podcast is really biochemical. It is secondary to this phenomenon of insulin blocking leptin signaling. You gotta fix that first, get the insulin down any way you can. And the best way, get rid of the refined carbohydrate and sugar. That's where you start."

And the very first time it was ever mentioned was 1962, and it didnt pick up in speed until 1986, which was the same year as Cipollone v.

Now, the problem with the label is it only tells you what's in the food. What you really need to know is what's been done to the food, because it's the ultra processed food that's the problem. They don't want to tell you that. That's secret. Okay. Secret from a proprietary standpoint, but also secret, because if you knew what they did to it, you wouldn't need it. You would never buy it. And they don't want you to know. So they only tell you what's in the food. That's not what's important. It's what's been done to the food that's important.

We have a business model whereby the food services director either purchases or rents a dilapidated factory in the center of the district, repurposes it into a food preparation facility. They can make 27 to 30,000 meals a day with a skeleton crew. And you control what's in it. And because you're buying in volume, it actually reduces the cost. So it's cheaper than buying it from Cisco or Aramark or Sodexo or wherever, and then you farm it out via truck or bus to all the different schools. So every kid gets a hot meal made from scratch each day. And we can solve this problem."

For people that want to cut out sugar, which you clearly stated is the most important thing to do for one's health, how do we know how much sugar is in something?

Don't. Don't eat it."

And the reason they use all of them is because they can include a different sugar as number five, number six, number seven, number eight, number nine on the list. When you add it up, it becomes number one. They hide it in plain sight and they do it on purpose. Now, do I expect everybody to memorize all 262 names? No, of course not. Can you figure it out yourself? Well, the answer is no. Unless they have the line where it says added sugars. If it says added sugars, it is either sucrose or high fructose corn syrup. No one's adding lactose, okay? That's not."

So if it says added sugars, that's a good place to start. No greater than one teaspoon per serving. No greater than 4 grams per serving of added sugars. Anything greater than that, leave at the."

The processing of fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, fructose in particular. The clear detriments of consuming fructose on so many different organ systems. I love, love, love that you separated out food science, nutrition, and metabolic health. That's a gazillion dollar delineation for people to understand and to shape their understanding of all the information that's out there and bins into these different categories. You've given us so many actionable tools, new conceptual frameworks. You've given us a real tour de force today, just oh, so clear language. So I want to thank you. I've learned a ton, and I know everyone else has as well. And if people have questions, they can, of course, put them in the comments section on YouTube. That's the best place. We'll provide links to all the companies and websites that you referenced and some of your other work. And listen, I just.
