        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today marks the first journal club episode between myself and doctor Peter Attia. For any of you that are not familiar with doctor Peter Attia, he is a medical doctor, an MD, who is an expert in all aspects of health and lifespan. He's the author of a bestselling book entitled Outlive, which is a phenomenal resource on all things health, span and lifespan. And he is the host of the very popular podcast the Drive, where he interviews various experts in all domains of medicine and scientists as well. Today, Peter and I hold our first online collaborative journal club. For those of you that aren't familiar with what a journal club is, a journal club is a common practice in graduate school and or medical school whereby students get together to discuss one or two papers, to critique those papers, and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers with the conclusions of the authors, and to highlight any key takeaways. Peter and I have been wanting to do a journal club together for a very long time and we decided to do that journal club and to record it for you. So today you will be sitting in on the first Huberman Attia journal club. By the way, it could just have easily been called the Attia Huberman Journal Club and we will discuss two papers. First, Peter is going to discuss a paper on metformin, which is a drug that many people are interested in for its potential role in longevity. I want to highlight potential there. He's going to compare that paper to previous findings on metformin. And by the end of that discussion, he will advise as to whether or not he himself would take Metformin and whether or not other people might be well advised or ill advised to take metformin based on the data in that paper. And at this time, then I present a paper which is about the placebo effect. I have to imagine that most of you have heard of the placebo effect, but what's interesting about the paper that we discussed today is that it shows that the placebo effect can actually follow a dose response. So it's not just all or none. It actually is the case that you can scale the degree of placebo effect depending on whether or not you're thinking you're taking low doses, moderate doses, or high doses of a particular drug. And the particular drug that's discussed in the paper that I cover is nicotine so for those of you that are interested in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmacology, or frankly, for people who are simply interested in how our beliefs can shape our physiology, I think you'll find that discussion to be very interesting. So by the end of today's episode, you will not only have learned about two novel sets of findings, one in the realm of longevity as it relates to Metformin, and another in the realm of neurobiology and placebos or placebo effects, but you will also learn how a journal club is conducted. I think you'll see in observing how we parse these papers and discuss them, even arguing in them at times, that what scientists and clinicians do is they take a look at the existing peer reviewed research, and they look at that peer reviewed research with a fresh eye, asking, does this paper really show what it claims to show or not? And in some cases, the answer is yes. And in other cases, the answer is no. What I know is for certain is that by the end of today's episode, you will learn a lot of science. You'll learn a lot about health practices, some of which you may want to apply or avoid, and you'll learn a lot about how science and medicine is carried out. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklimentlmnt.com huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my journal club discussion with doctor Peter Attia. Peter, so good to have you here."

But this time we've opted to try talking about these papers that we find particularly exciting in real time for the first time as this podcast format. First of all, so that people can get some sense of why we're so excited about these papers. We do feel that people should know about these findings. And second of all, that it's an opportunity for people to learn how to dissect information and think about the papers they hear about in the news, the papers they might download from Pubmed if they're inclined to, but also just to start thinking like scientists and clinicians and get a better sense of what it looks like to pick through a paper, the good, the bad, and the ugly. So we're flying a little blind here, which is fun. I'm definitely excited for all the above reasons."

And actually we used to run a journal club inside the practice where once a month one person would just pick a paper and we would go through it in kind of a formal journal club presentation. We've gotten away from it for the last year just because we've been a little stretched. Then I think it's something we need to resume because it's a great way to learn and it's a skill people probably ask you all the time because I know I get asked all the time, hey, what are the do's and don'ts of interpreting scientific papers? Is it enough to just read the abstract? And usually the answer is, well, no, but the how to is tougher. And I think the two papers we've chosen today illustrate two opposite ends of the spectrum. You're going to obviously talk about something that we're going to probably get into. The technical nature of the essays, the limitations, et cetera, and the paper ultimately, I've chosen to present, although I apologize, I'm surprising you with this, up until a few minutes ago, is actually a very straightforward, simple epidemiologic paper that I think has important significance. I had originally gone down the rabbit hole on a much more nuanced paper about ATP binding cassettes in cholesterol absorption, but ultimately, I thought this one might be more interesting to a broader audience. By the way, I got to tell you a funny story. So I had a dream last night about you. And in this dream you were obsessed with making this certain drink that was like your elixir, and it had all of these crazy ingredients in it. Supplements. Tons of supplements in it. But the one thing I remembered when I woke up, cause I forgot most of them. I was really trying so hard to remember them? One thing that you had in it was dew. Like, you had to collect a certain amount of dew off the leaves every morning to put into this drink. It was so. It was like."

And all of your clothing had to be tailored with a special pocket that you could put the thermos into so that you were never without the special Andrew drink. And again, you know how dreams, when you're having them, seem so logical and real, and then you wake up and you're like, that doesn't even make sense. Like, why would he want the thermos in his shirt like that? That would warm it up, like, you know, all these. But, boy, it was a realistic dream and there were lots of things in it, including dew, special dew off the leaves every morning."

In fact, in its many forms, usually the loose leaf, I don't tend to drink it out of the gourd. My dad's argentine, so that's where I picked it up. I started drinking it when I was, like five years old or younger, which I don't recommend people do. It's heavily caffeinated. Don't drink the smoked versions either, folks. I think those are the potentially carcinogenic. But this thing that you describe of carrying around the thermos close to the body, if you are ever in Uruguay, or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant anywhere in the world carrying a thermos with them and to their meals and hugging it close, chances are they're uruguayan and they're drinking yerba mate. They drink it usually after their meals. It's supposed to be good for your digestion, so it's not that far from. From reality. I don't carry the thermos, but I do drink mate every day and I'm going to start collecting dew off the leaves."

It was just I was at a sticking point with a certain process in my life. And then I was taking a walk while waking and realized that my brain, my subconscious, was going to keep working on this. I just decided it's going to keep working on it. And then two nights later, I traveled to a meeting in Aspen and I had the most profound dream ever where I was able to sense something and feel something I've always wanted to feel as so real within the dream. Woke up, knew it was a dream, and realized this is what people close to me that I respect have been talking about. But I was able to feel it. And therefore I can actually access this in my waking life. It was absolutely transformative for me. Anyway, sometime I can share more details with you or the audience, but for now, we should talk about these papers."

So we're going to talk about a paper titled reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in type two diabetics treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes, a retrospective cohort study. This is by Matthew Thomas Keys and colleagues. This was published last fall. Why is this paper important? So, this paper is important because in 2014, Bannister published a paper that I think, in many ways, kind of got the world very excited about metformin. So this is almost ten years ago, and I'm sure many people have heard about this paper, even if they're not familiar with it, but they've heard the concept of the paper. And in many ways, it's the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential for giro protection with metformin. And I should probably just define for the audience what zero protection means when we think."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "That's a great point. So I'll start with the latter. So metformin is a drug that has been used for many years. Depends, you know, where it was first approved, I think was in Europe. But call it, directionally, 50 plus years of use as a first line agent for patients with type two diabetes in the US, maybe 40 plus years. So this is a drug that's been around forever, trade name glucophage or brand name, but again, it's a generic drug today. The mechanism by which metformin works is debated hotly, but what I think is not debated is the immediate thing that metformin does, which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria. So again, maybe just taking a step back. So the mitochondria, as everybody thinks of those, as the cellular engine for making ATP, the most efficient way that we make ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation, where we take either fatty acid pieces or a breakdown product of glucose. Once it's partially metabolized to pyruvate, we put that into an electron transport chain, and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates onto ADP. So it's, you think of everything you do. Eating is taking the chemical energy in food, taking the energy that's in those bonds, making electrical energy in the mitochondria. Those electrons pump a gradient that allow you to make ATP to give a sense of how primal and important this is. If you block that process completely, you die. So everybody's probably heard of cyanide. Cyanide is something that is incredibly toxic, even at the smallest doses. Cyanide is a complete blocker of this process. And if my memory serves me correctly, I think it blocks complex four of the mitochondria. I don't know if you recall if it complex three or complex four."

        "text": "These things that block audio, latrotoxin, bungarotox. I really geek out on this stuff because it allows me to talk about neuroscience, animals and scary stuff. It's like, combines it. So we could do that sometime for fun, maybe at the end, if we have a few moments."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So something like cyanide that is a very potent inhibitor of this electron transport chain will kill you instantly. People understand that, of course, a drop of cyanide and you would. You would be dead, literally instantaneously. So metformin works at the first of those complexes. I believe there are four, if my memory serves correctly, for electron transport chain complexes. But of course, it's not a complete inhibition of it. It's just kind of a weak blocker of that. And the net effect of that is what? The net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine diphosphate. What's less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabetics? Because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucose that the liver puts out. So hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems that's happening in type two diabetes. You may recall, I think we talked about this on a previous podcast. You and I, sitting here with normal blood sugar, have about 5 grams of glucose in our total circulation. That's it. 5 grams. Think about how quickly the brain will go through that within minutes. So the only thing that keeps us alive is our liver's ability to titrate out glucose. And if it puts out too much, for example, if the glucose level was consistently two teaspoons, you would have type two diabetes. So the difference between being metabolically healthy and having profound type two diabetes is one teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream. So the ability of the liver to tamp down on high glucose output is important. Metformin seems to do that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So can I just ask one question? Is it fair to provide this overly simplified summary of the biochemistry, which is that when we eat, the food is broken down, but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then our cells can use in the form of ATP, and the mitochondria are central to that process, and that metformin is partially short circuiting the energy production process. And so even though we are eating, when we have metformin in our system, presumably there is going to be less net glucose, the bonds are going to be broken down, we're chewing, we're digesting, but less of that has turned into blood sugar glucose."

It had sort of, sort of analogous to plant fiber or something like that. So it was being put into potato chips. And whatnot. And the idea was that people would simply excrete it.

        "text": "That's right. So we've got this drug. We've got this drug, metformin. It's considered a perfect first line agent for people with type two diabetes. So again, what's happening when you have type two diabetes? The primary insult probably occurs in the muscles, and it is insulin resistance. Everybody hears that term. What does it mean? Insulin is a peptide. It binds to a receptor on a cell. So let's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle. Because the muscle is responsible for most glucose disposal. It gets glucose out of the circulation. High glucose is toxic. We have to put it away and we want to put most of it into our muscles. That's where we store 75% to 80% of it. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, tyrosine kinase is triggered inside. So just ignore all that. But a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell that leads to a phosphorylation. So ATP donates a phosphate group and a transporter. Just think of like a little tunnel, like a little straw goes up through the level of the cell, and now glucose can freely flow in. So I'm sure you've talked a lot about this with your audience. Things that move against gradients need pumps to move them. Things that move with gradients don't. Glucose is moving with its gradient into the cell. It doesn't need active transport, but it does need the transporter put there. That requires the energy, and that's the job of insulin, by the way."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I did not know that. I mean, I certainly know active and passive transport as it relates to, like, neurotransmitter and ion flow. But I'd never heard that. When insulin binds to a cell, that literally a little straw is placed into the membrane."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Glucose doesn't need a pump to move it in because there's much more glucose outside the cell than inside. So it's just. But the energy required is to move the straw up to the cell."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it is. So what happens is, as and Gerald Shulman at Yale did the best work on elucidating this as the intramuscular fat increases. And by intramuscular, I mean intracellular fat, triacyl and diacylglycerides accumulate in a muscle cell. That signal gets interrupted, and all of a sudden, I'm making these numbers up. If you used to need two units of insulin to trigger the little transporter, now you need three, and then you need four, and then you need five, you need more and more insulin to get the thing up. That is the definition of insulin resistance. The cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insulin, and therefore the early mark of insulin resistance. The canary in the coal mine, is not an increase in glucose. It's an increase in insulin. So, normal glycemia with hyperinsulinemia, especially postprandial, meaning after you eat, hyperinsulinemia is the thing that tells you, hey, you're 510 years away from this being a real problem. So, fast forward many steps down the line. Someone with type two diabetes has long passed that system. Now, not only are they insulin resistant, where they just need a boatload of insulin, which is made by the pancreas to get glucose out of the circulation, but now that system's not even working well, and now they're not getting glucose into the cell. So now their glucose level is elevated, and even though it's continually being chewed up and used up, because, again, the brain alone would account for most of that glucose disposal, the liver is now becoming insulin resistant as well. And now the liver isn't able to regulate how much glucose to put into circulation, and it's overdoing it. So now you have too much glucose being pumped into the circulation by the liver, and you have the muscles that can't dispose of it. And it's really a vicious, brutal cascade, because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle is now starting to happen in the pancreas. And now the relatively few cells in the pancreas, called beta cells, that make insulin, are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation within the pancreas itself. And so now the thing that you need to make more insulin is less effective at making insulin. So, ultimately, way, way, way down the line, a person with type two diabetes might actually even require insulin exogenously."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So energy imbalance would be an enormous one. Inactivity or insufficient activity is probably the single most important. So when Gerald Shulman was running clinical trials at Yale, they would be recruiting undergrads to study, obviously, because you're typically recruiting young people, and they would be doing these very detailed mechanistic studies where they would require actual tissue biopsies. So you're going to biopsy somebody's quadriceps and actually look at what's happening in the muscles? Well, I remember him telling me this when I interviewed him on my podcast. He said, the most important criteria of the people we interviewed is that because they were still lean, these weren't people that were overweight, but they had to be inactive. You couldn't have active people in these studies. So exercising is one of the most important things you're going to do to ward off insulin resistance. But there are other things that can cause insulin resistance. Sleep deprivation has a profound impact on insulin resistance. I think we probably talked about this previously, but if you. There's some very elegant, mechanistic studies where you sleep deprived people, you know, you let them only sleep for 4 hours for a week, you'll reduce their glucose disposal by about half. Wow. Which is. I mean, that's a staggering amount of. You're basically inducing profound insulin resistance in just a week of sleep deprivation. Hypercortisolemia is another factor, and then, obviously, energy imbalance. So where when you're. When you're accumulating excess energy, when you're getting fatter, if you start spilling that fat outside of the subcutaneous fat cells into the muscle, into the liver, into the pancreas, all those things are exacerbating it."

So some of the drugs tell you to make more insulin. That's one of the strategies. So here are drugs like sulfonylureas. They tell the body make more insulin. Other drugs, like insulin, just give you more of the insulin thing. Metformin tackles the problem elsewhere. It tamps down glucose by addressing the glucose disposal, the hepatic glucose output channel. GLP. One agonists are another drug. They increase insulin sensitivity, initially, causing you to also make more insulin. Glp."

For example, a PCSK nine inhibitor is sort of giro protective, but it's targeting one specific pathway, which is cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia, whereas the idea is a giro protective agent would target hallmarks of aging. There are nine hallmarks of aging. Please don't ask me to recite them. I've never been able to get all nine straight. But people know what we're talking about, right? So decreased autophagy, increased senescence, decreased nutrient sensing or defective nutrient sensing, proteomic instability, genomic instability, methylation, all of these things, epigenetic changes, those are all the nine hallmarks of aging."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah. A geoprotective agent would target those deep down biological hallmarks of aging. And in 2014, a paper came out by Bannister that basically got the world focused on this problem. By the world, I mean the world of anti aging. So what Bannister and colleagues did was they took a registry from the UK and they got a set of patients who were on metformin with type two diabetes, but only metformin. So these were people who had just progressed to diabetes. They were not put on any other drug, just metformin. And then they found from the same registry, a group of matched controls. So this is a standard way that epidemiologic studies are done, because, again, you don't have the luxury of doing the randomization. So you're trying to account for all the biases that could exist by saying, we're going to take people who look just like that person with diabetes. So can we match them for age, sex, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, bmI, everything we can. And then let's look at what happened to them over time. Now, again, this is all happening in the future, so you're looking into the past. It's retrospective in that sense. And so let me just kind of pull up the sort of table here so I can kind of walk through. And this is not in the paper we talked about, but I think this is an important background. So they did something that at the time, I didn't really notice. I didn't notice what they did. I probably did, and I forgot, but I didn't notice this until about five years ago when I went back and looked at the paper and they did something called informative censoring. So the way the study worked is if you were put on metformin, we're going to follow you. If you're not on metformin, we're going to follow you, and we're going to track the number of deaths from any cause that occurred. This is called all cause mortality, or ACM. And it's really the gold standard in a trial of this nature or a study of this nature or even a clinical trial, you want to know how much are people dying from anything? Because we're trying to prevent or delay death of all causes. Informative censoring says if a person who's on metformin deviates from that inclusion criteria, we will not count them in the final assessment. So how are the ways that that can happen? Well, one, the person can be lost to follow up. Two, they can just stop taking their metformin. Three, and more commonly, they can progress to needing a more significant drug. So all of those patients were excluded from the study. So think about that for a moment. This is, in my opinion, a significant limitation of this study because what you're basically doing is saying we're only going to consider the patients who were on metformin, stayed on metformin and never progressed through it. And we're going to compare those to people who were not having type two diabetes. So an analogy here would be imagine we're going to do a study of two groups that we think are almost identical. One of them are smokers and the other are identical in every way, but they're not smokers. And we're going to follow them to see which ones get lung cancer. But every time somebody dies in the smoking group, we stop counting them. When you get to the end, you're going to have a less significant view of the health status of that group. So with that caveat, the Bannister study found a very interesting result, which was the crude death rate was. And by the way, the way these are done, this is also one of the challenges of epidemiology, is the math gets much more complicated. You have to normalize death rate for the amount of time you study the people. Everything is normalized to thousand person years. The crude death rate in the group of people with type two diabetes who were on metformin, including the censoring, was 14.4. So 14.4 deaths occurred per thousand patient years. If you looked at the control group, it was 15.2. This was a startling result. And I remember reading this in, again, 2014, and being like, holy crap, this is really amazing."

Again, the proponents of metformin being a giro protective agent. I put myself in this category at one point. I would put myself today in the category of undecided, but at the time, I very much believed this was a very good suggestion that metformin was doing other things. You mentioned a couple already. Metformin is a weak inhibitor of mtor. Metformin reduces inflammation. Metformin potentially tamps down on senescent cells and their secretory products. There are lots of things metformin could be doing that are off target, and it might be that those things are conferring the advantage."

And we have both. Active conductances mean they're triggered by electrical changes in the gradients via changes in electrical potential. And then they're passive gradients where things can just flow back and forth until there's a balance equal inside and outside the cell. I think what's different is that there's some movement of a lot of stuff inside of neurons when neurotransmitters like dopamine binds to its receptor. And then a bunch of. It's like a bucket brigade that gets kicked off internally. But it's not often that you hear about receptors getting inserted into cells very quickly. Normally after they go through a process of transcribing genes and making sure that the specific proteins are made. And then those are long, slow things that take place over the course of many hours or days. What you're talking about is a real on demand insertion of a channel.

        "text": "That's correct. Near Barzilai is probably the senior PI on that. And I think in many ways the Bannister study, along with some other studies, but of lesser significance, probably provided some of the motivation for the tame trial. So they said, okay, look, we're going to do this. We're going to use a different cohort of people. So the first study that we just talked about, the Bannister study used, I believe it was like roughly, they sampled like 95,000 subjects from a uk biobank here they used a larger sample. They did about half a million people sampled from a danish health registry. And they did something pretty elegant. They created two groups to study. So the first was just a standard replication of what Bannister did, which was just a group of people with and without diabetic that they tried to match as perfectly as possible. But then they did a second analysis in parallel with discordant twins. So same sex twins that only differed in that one had diabetes and one didn't. I thought this was very elegant because here you have a degree of genetic similarity and you have similar environmental factors during childhood that might give you, you know, allow you to see if there's any sort of difference in signal. So now turning this back into a little bit of a journal club, virtually any clinical paper you're going to read, table one is the characteristics of the people in the study. You always want to take a look at that. So when I look at table one here, you can see it's. And by the way, just for people watching this, we're going to make all these papers and figures available. So if you're, you know, don't, you know, we'll have nice show notes that'll make all this clear. So table one in the keys paper shows the baseline characteristics. And again, it's almost always going to be the first table in a paper. Usually the first figure in the paper is a study design. It's usually a flow chart that says these were the inclusion criteria. These were all the people that got excluded. This is how we randomized, et cetera. And you can see here that there are four columns. So the first two are the singletons. These are people who are not related. And then the second two are the twins who are matched. And you can see, remember how I said they sampled about 500,000 people? You can see the numbers. So they got 7842 singletons on metformin, the same number. Then they pulled out matched without diabetes on the twins. They got 976 on metformin with diabetes, and then by definition, 976 co twins without them. And you look at all these characteristics, what was their age upon entry, how many were men? What was the year of indexing when we got them, what medications were they on, what was their highest level of education, marital status, et cetera. The one thing I want to call out here that really cannot be matched in a study like this. So this is a very important limitation is the medication. So look at that column, Andrew. Notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched until you get to the medication list."

What about antiplatelet therapy? That's 30% versus 14% antihypertensive, 65% versus 63% versus 31%."

Okay. So the two big things that were done in this experiment or in this survey or, you know, study to differentiate it from banister was one the twin trick, which I think is pretty cool. The second thing that they did was they did a sensitivity analysis with and without informative censoring. So one of the other things they wanted to know was, hey, does it really matter if we don't count the metformin patients who progress? So let's see what transcribed the next figure. Figure two. Pardon me, the next table. Table two walks you through the crude mortality rate in each of the groups. So the most important row, I think, in this table is the one that says crude mortality per thousand person years. Now, you recall that in the previous study, in the Banister study, those were on the ballpark of about 15 per. Okay, so let's look at each of these. So in the single, the singletons without.

So you've got some people that are going to live 76 years, 52 years, 91 years, and you're pooling all of those until you hit 1000. And then that becomes kind of a normalized division. You're basically like, so let's say the control group, you're asking if there were 1000 person years available to live, how likely is it that this person would live another 15 years?"

So it's typically what you're doing when you look at aged groups in buckets of like decades. So that's why we can say the highest mortality is like people 90 and up. Even though the absolute number of deaths is small, it's because there's not that many people there. The majority of deaths in absolute terms probably occur in the 7th decade. But as you go up, because the denominator is shrinking, you have to normalize to it. So we just normalize to the number of people. Here are all the people that started the year. Here are all the people that ended the year. What's the death rate? Why are these done in a slightly more complicated way? Because we don't follow these people for their whole lives. We're only following them for a period of observation. In this case roughly three years. So to say something like, we have accrued death rate of five deaths per thousand person years. One way to think about that is if you had 1000 people and you followed them for one year, you'd expect five to die. If you had 500 people and you followed them for two years, you expect five to die. If you have 1000 people and you follow them for one year, you expect five to die. Those would all be considered equivalent mortalities."

When you adjust for age, a very important check to do is what is the crude death rate of the people on metformin who are not twins versus who are twins. Now in this table they look different because it's 24.93 for the metformin group and 21.68 for the twin group that's on metformin. When you adjust for age, they're almost identical. It goes from 24.93 to 24.71. Other point I'll make here for people who are going to be looking at this table is you'll notice there are parentheses after every one of these numbers. What does that offer in there? Those parentheses are offering the 95% confidence interval. For example, to take the number 24.93 is the crude death rate of how many people are dying who take metformin. What it's telling you is we're 95% confident that the actual number is between 23.23 and 26.64. If a 95% confidence interval does not cross the number zero, it's statistically significant. Okay, so the first thing that just jumps out at you, I think when you look at this, is there's clearly a difference here between the people who have diabetes and those who don't. It complicates the study a little bit because it's basically two studies in one. But you're comparing 95, pardon me, 24.93 to 16.86, which by the way, remains after age adjustment.

I think it's actually worth looking at it because they show up in all sorts of studies. So if you look at figure one, it's a Kaplan Meyer curve curve, which is a mortality curve. So you'll see these in any study that is looking at death. And this can be prospective, randomized, this can be retrospective, but these are always going to show up. And I think it's really worth understanding what a Kaplan Meier curve shows you. So on the x axis is always time and on the y axis is always the cumulative survival. So it's a curve that always goes from zero to one, one, or 100%, and it's always decreasing monotonically, meaning it can only go down or stay flat. It can never go back up. So that's what a cumulative mortality curve looks like."

In this figure, the matched controls are the darker lines and the people with type two diabetes on metformin, that's the lighter line. You'll also notice, and I like the way they've done it here. They've got shading around each one."

Put crudely, that people who are taking metformin that have diabetes are dying at a faster rate. For every single year examined, the two lines do not overlap except at the beginning when everyone's alive. It's like a foot race where basically the people with metformin and diabetes are falling behind and dying as they fall."

It's not a requirement that they never cross. It's only a requirement that they're monotonically decreasing or staying flat. So I've seen cancer treatment drugs where they have like two drugs going head to head in a cancer treatment, and like, one starts out looking really, really bad, but then all of a sudden it kind of flattens while the other one goes bad and then it actually crosses and goes underneath. But that's not the case here. So to your point, the people with diabetes taking metformin in both the matched singletons and the discordants are dropping much faster and they always stay below. And I was just going to say that the shading is just showing you a 95% confidence interval. So you're just putting basically error bars along this. So if this were experimental data, if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice and you were watching their survival and you were, you know what? You'd have error bars on this, which you're actually measuring. So this is because you have much more data here. You're just showing this in this fashion."

You have the very tall kid and the very shorter kid, and you'll have the short kid and the medium kid. So there's a range, there's going to be an average, a mean, and then there'll be standard deviations and standard errors. And so these confidence intervals just give a sense of how much range. Some people die early, some people die late. Within a given year, they're going to be different ages. So these error bars can account for a lot of different forms of variability. Here. You're talking about the variability is how many people in each group die. We're not tracking one diabetic taking metformin versus a control. I should have asked this earlier, but."

So they're using this quite complicated type of mathematics called a cox proportional hazard, which is what generates hazard ratios. And basically any model has to have some error in it. And so they're basically saying this is the error. So you could argue when you look at that figure, we don't know exactly where the line is in there, but we know it's in that shaded area. Sorry to make one other point. If those shaded areas overlapped, you couldn't really make the conclusion. You wouldn't know for sure that one is different from the other."

        "text": "Yeah, that's actually a good opportunity to raise a common myth, which is a lot of people, when they look at a paper, let's say it's a bar graph, and they see these error bars, and they will say, people often think, oh, if the error bars overlap, it's not a significant difference. But if the error bars don't overlap, meaning there's enough separation, then that's a real and meaningful difference. And that's not always the case. It depends a lot on the form of the experiment. I often see some of the more robust Twitter battles over how people are reading graphs, and I think it's important to remember that you run the statistics, hopefully the correct statistics for the sample, but determining significance, whether or not the result could be due to something other than chance, of course, your confidence in that increases as it becomes typically p values, p less than 0.001%, chance that it's due to chance. So very low probability, less than 0.05, tends to be the gold standard cutoff. But when you're talking about data like these, which are repeated measures, over time, people are dropping out, literally over time. You're saying they've modeled it to make predictions as to what would happen. We're not necessarily looking at, you know, raw data points here."

I think the other thing you always want to understand is just because something doesn't achieve statistical significance, the only way you can say it's not significant is you have to know what it was powered to detect. And statistical power is a very important concept that probably doesn't get discussed enough. But before you do an experiment, you have to have an expectation of what you believe the difference is between the groups, and you have to determine the number of samples you will need to assess whether or not that difference is there or not. So you use something. It's. It's called a power table, and you would go to the power table. So if you're doing treatment a versus treatment b, and you say, well, look, I think treatment a is going to have a 50% response, and I think treatment B will have a 65% response. You literally go to a power table that says 50% response, 15% difference. That gives you a place on the grid. And I want to be 90% sure that I'm right. So 90% power. I'm being a little bit. So there's going to be a statistician listening to this who's going to want to kill me. But this is directionally the way we would describe it. And that tells you this is how many animals or people you would need in this study. You're going to need 147 in each group. And by the way, if you now do the experiment with 147 and you fail to find significance, you can comfortably say there is no statistical difference, at least up to that 15%. There may be a difference at 10%, but you weren't powered to look at 10%."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. And very important point that you're making. Another point that's just a more general one about statistics in general. The way to reduce variability in a data set is to increase sample size. That kind of makes sense, right? If I just walk into a 10th grade class and, hey, I'm going to measure height, and I look up by the first three kids that I see, and I happen to look over there and it's the three that all play on the volleyball team together, my sample size is small and I'm likely to get a skewed representation, in this case, taller than average. So increasing sample size tends to decrease variation. So that's why when you hear about a study from the uk biobank, or from half a million danish citizens, like, for instance, in this study, those are enormous sample sizes. So even though this is not an experimental study, it's an epidemiological, observational study. There's tremendous power by way of the enormous number of subjects in the study."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And that's the way that epidemiology will make up for its deficit. So you could never do a randomized assignment study on half a million people. So epidemiology makes up for its biggest limitation, which is it can never compensate for inherent biases by saying, we can do infinite duration if we want. Like, we could survey people over the course of their lives and we can have the biggest sample size possible. Because this is relatively cheap. The cost of actually doing an experiment where you have tens of thousands of people is prohibitive. I mean, if you look at the women's health Initiative, which was a five year study on, I don't know, what was it, 50,000 women? I mean, that was a billion dollar study. So this is the balancing act between epidemiology and randomized prospective experiments. So they both offer something, but you just have to know they're blind spots of each one. So let's just kind of wrap this up. I mean, I think let's just go to table four, which I think is the most important table in here, which now lays out the final results in terms of the hazard ratio. So this is the way we want to really be thinking about this. So again, hazard ratios, these are important things to understand. A hazard ratio is a number, and you always subtract one from the hazard ratio. And that tells you if it's a positive number, if it's a number, sorry, if it's a number greater than one, you subtract one, and that tells you the relative harm. So if the hazard ratio is 1.5, you subtract one. 0.5 is a 50% increase in risk. If the number is negative, you may recall on the Bannister paper, the hazard ratio was 0.85. So if it's not, so that means it's a 15% reduction in relative risk. And here you can see all the hazard ratios are positive. So what it's telling you here is, and I'm going to walk through this because there's a lot of information packed here. You've got singletons, you've got twins. They're showing you three different ways that they do it. They do an unadjusted model. If you just look at the singletons with and without metformin and you make no adjustments, the hazard ratio is 1.48, meaning the people on metformin had a 48% greater chance of dying in any given year than their non diabetic counterpart."

Okay, so they're dying more.

And the reason I'm doing the unadjusted is that's where they did the sensitivity analysis. I don't think it really matters that much. You just have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. You'll recall that that was a 48% chance of increased mortality. All cause mortality if you stop counting. Pardon me? If you don't censor. Meaning if you include everybody, including when people on metformin with diabetes die. If you censor them, it comes down to 1.39. In other words, this is a very important finding. It did not undo the benefits that we saw in the banister study. Bannister saw a 15% reduction in mortality when they censored. When keys censored, it got better, but not that much better. It went from 48% to 39%. In the twins, it went from 115% down to only 97%. So in some ways, this presents a little bit of an enigma because it's not entirely clear to me, having read these papers many times, exactly why Bannister found such an outlined, like, such a different response. There's another technical detail of this paper, which is you can see on the right side of table four, they did something called a nested case control. But you'll see. And I was going to go into a long explanation of what nested case controls are. It's another pretty elegant way to do case control studies where you sample by year and you sort of normalize. You don't count all the cases at the end. You count them one by one. I don't think it's worth getting into, Andrew, because it doesn't change the answer. You can see it changes it just slightly, but it doesn't change the point. The point here is the keys paper makes it undeniably clear that in that population, there was no advantage offered by metformin that undid the disadvantage of having type two diabetes. This does not mean that metformin wasn't helping them, because we don't know what these people would have been like without metformin. It could be that this bought them a 50% reduction in relative mortality to where they'd been. But what it says is, in a way, this is what you would have expected. This is what you would have expected ten years ago, before the Bannister paper."

I stopped taking it for a different reason, which we can talk about in a sec. But that was the first time I went back and said, wait a minute, this information, this informative censoring thing is, that's a little fishy. And I think we weren't looking at a true group of real type two diabetics. Now, that said, maybe it doesn't matter. In other words, maybe, and even the keys paper doesn't tell us that metformin wouldn't be beneficial, because it could be that those people, if they were on nothing, as their matched cohorts were on nothing, would have been dying at a hazard ratio of three.

And in 2018 was when I started blood testing for my zone two. So previously, when I was doing zone two testing, I was just going off my power meter and heart rate. But this is after I'd met Inigo San Milan, and I started, like, wanting to use the lactate threshold of two millimole as my determinant of where to put my wattage on the bike. And I'm like, doing finger pricks before I start. And I'm like, 1.6 millimole. And I'm like, what the hell is going on? I can't be 1.6."

And I found that it worked very quickly, got me very lean. I could exercise, I could think. I could sleep. A lot of my rationale for following one eating regimen or another, what I eat is to enjoy myself, but also have mental energy, because if I can't sleep at night, I'm not going to replenish. If I don't replenish, I'm going to feel like garbage. I don't care how lean I am or what you know. So I found the slow carb diet, which was in the four hour body, to be a very good plan for me. It was pretty easy. You drop some things like bread, et cetera. You don't drink calories, except after a resistance training session, et cetera. But one day a week, you have this so called cheat day. And on the cheat day, anything goes. And so I would eat, you know, eight croissants, and then I'd alternate to sweet stuff, and then I go to pizza, and by the end of the day, you don't want to look at an item of food at all. So the only modification I made to the slow carb diet for our body thing was the day after the cheat day, I wouldn't eat. I would just fast. And I had no problem doing that because it was just basically, well, since you said, what was it? Anal seepage, I did not have that. But since you said that, I won't up the ante here, but I'll at least match your anal seepage comment by saying I had, let's just call it profound gastric distress after eating like that the next day. So the last thing you want to do is eat any food. I would just hydrate and oftentimes try and get some exercise. And what I read was that Berberine, poor man's met for metformin, could buffer blood glucose and in some ways make me feel less sick when ingesting all these calories and in many cases spiking my blood sugar and insulin because you're having ice cream and you're, you know, et cetera. And indeed it worked. So if I took berberine and I don't recall the milligram count, and then I ate, you know, twelve donuts, I felt fine. It was as if I had eaten one donut."

I didn't measure it, but I just felt I had headaches. I didn't feel good. And then I would eat a pizza or two and feel fine. And so I realized that berberine was putting me on this lower blood sugar state. That was the logic, anyway, and it allowed me to eat these cheap foods. But when I cycled off of the four hour, because I don't follow the slow carb diet anymore, although I might again, at some point when I stopped doing those cheat days, I didn't have any reason to take the berberine. And I feared that I wasn't ingesting enough carbohydrates in order to really justify trying to buffer my blood glucose. Also, my blood glucose tends to be."

Then the panel over there reviews it and they decide, yep, this is interesting. We'll go ahead and study it. So when I think David Allison nominated acarbose to be studied, the rationale was it would be a caloric restriction memetic, because you would literally just fail to absorb, I don't know, make up some number. Right. 15% to 20% of your carbohydrates would not be absorbed, and therefore the mice would effectively be calorically restricted and passed them out. That's right. And what happened was really interesting. One, the mice lived longer on acarbose, but two, they didn't weigh any less. So they lived longer, but not through calorie restriction."

I mean, there's a lot to explore here, and I know you've explored a lot of that on your podcast. I've done far less of that, but. Well, at least it seems that we know the following things for sure. You don't want insulin too high nor too low. You don't want blood glucose too high nor too low if the buffering systems for that are disrupted. Clearly, exercise, meaning regular exercise, is the best way to keep that system in check. But in the absence of that tool, or I would say in addition to that tool, is there any glucose disposal agent?

And energy balance probably plays a greater role in glucose homeostasis from a nutrition standpoint than the individual constituents of the meal. Now, that's not entirely true. I can imagine a scenario where a person could be in a negative energy balance, eating twix bars all day and drinking big gulps. But I also don't think that's a very sustainable thing to do, because if, by definition, I'm gonna put you in negative energy balance, consuming that much crap, I'm gonna destroy you. Like, you're gonna feel so miserable, you're gonna be starving, right? You're not gonna be satiated, eating pure garbage, and being in caloric deficit. You're gonna end up having to go into caloric excess. So that's why it's an interesting thought experiment. I don't think it's a very practical experiment for a person to be generally satiated and an energy balance. They're probably eating about the right stuff, but I don't think that the specific macros matter as much as I used to think."

If the tame study ends up demonstrating that there is a zero protective benefit of metformin, I'll reconsider everything. We just have to, I think, all walk around with an appropriate degree of humility around what we know and what we don't know. But I would say right now, the epidemiology, the animal data, my own personal experience with its impact on my lactate production and exercise performance, there's a whole other rabbit hole we could go down another time, which is the impact on hypertrophy and strength, which appears to be attenuated as well by metformin. I still prescribe it to patients all the time.

Is there any benefit to it in terms of cellular health? Can you reset the system? Is there any idea that the changes, the clearing of senescent cells that we hear about autophagy in the short term, you can glean a lot of benefits and then go back to your regular pattern of eating, and then periodically, every couple of weeks or once a month, just fast for a day or two. Is there any benefit to that? That's purely in the domain of longevity, because there's all discipline function there. There's a flexibility function, there's probably an insulin sensitivity function. But is there any evidence that it can help us live longer?"

But two, even if you went with something longer, like what I used to do, right, I used to do seven days of water only per quarter, three days per month. So I was. But I was basically always like, it'd be three day fast, three day fast, seven day fast. Just imagine doing that all year, rotating, rotating, rotating. For many years I did that. Now, I certainly believed, and to this day I would say, I have no idea if that provided a benefit. But my thesis was, the downside of this is relatively circumscribed, which is profound misery for a few days. And what I didn't appreciate the time, which I obviously now look back at and realize is muscle mass lost. It's very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively after all of that loss. But my thought was exactly as you said, there's got to be a resetting of the system here. This must be sufficiently long enough to trigger all of those systems. But you're getting at a bigger problem with geoscience, which I'm really hoping the epigenetic field comes to the rescue on. It has not come close to it to date, which is we don't have biomarkers around true metrics of aging. Everything we have to date stinks. So we're really good at using molecules or interventions for which we have biomarkers. Right? Like when you lift weights, you can look at how much weight you're lifting, you can look at your dexa scan and see how much muscle mass you're generating. Like, those are biomarkers, those are giving you outputs that say my input is good or my input needs to be modified. When you take a sleep supplement, you can look at your eight sleep and go, oh, my sleep is getting better. Like, there's a biomarker. When you take metformin, when you take rapamycin, when you fast. We don't have a biomarker that gives us any insight into whether or not we're moving in the right direction. And if we are, are we taking enough? Just don't know. So I often get asked like, what's the single most important, important topic you would want to see more research dollars put to in terms of this space? And it's unquestionably this, as unsexy as it is. Like, who cares about biomarkers? But like, without them, I don't think we're going to get great answers because you can't do most of the experiments you and I would dream up."

        "text": "Yeah, unless it's an area that I know very, very well where I can skip to some things before reading it the whole way through. My process is always the same. And actually this is fun because I used to teach a class when I was a professor at UC San Diego called neural circuits in health and disease. And it was an evening course that grew very quickly from 50 students to 400 plus students. And we would do exactly this. We would parse papers. And I had everyone ask what I called the four questions, and it wasn't exactly four questions, but I have a little three by five card next to me, or a piece of x eleven paper typically. And when I sit down with a paper, I want to figure out what is the question they're asking, what's the general question, what's the specific question? And I write down the question then what was the approach? How did they test that question? And sometimes that can get a bit detailed. You can get into immunohistochemistry and they did a PCR for this. It's not so important for most people that they understand every method, but it is worthwhile that if you encounter a method like PCR or chromatography or fMRI, that you at least look up on the Internet what its purpose is. That will help a lot. And then it was what they found. And there you can usually figure out what they believe they found anyway by reading the figure headers. Figure one. Here's the header. Typically, if it's an experimental paper, it will tell you what they want you to think they found. And then I tend to want to know the conclusion of the study, then this is really the key one, and this is the one that would really distinguish the high performing students from the others. You have to go back at the end and ask whether or not the conclusions, the major conclusions drawn in the paper, are really substantiated by what they found and what they did. And that involves some thinking, it involves really spending some time thinking about what they identified. Now, this isn't something that anyone can do straight off the bat. It's a skill that you develop over time and different papers require different formats. But those four questions really form the cornerstone of teaching undergraduates, and I think graduate students as well, of how to read a paper. And again, it's something that can be cultivated and it's still how I approach papers. So what I do typically is I'll read a title, abstract. I usually then will skip to the figures and see how much of it I can digest without reading the text, and then go back and read the text. But in fairness, journals, great journals like science, like nature, oftentimes will pack so much information, the cell press journals too, into each figure, and it's coded with no definition of the acronyms, that almost always I'm into the introduction and results within a couple of minutes, wondering what the hell this acronym is, or that acronym is. And it's just wild how much nomenclature there really is. I can't remember. Was it you or was it our friend Paul Conte when he was here? Who said that? Oh, no, I'm sorry. It was neither. It was chair of ophthalmology at Stanford. Doctor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was a guest on the podcast recently, who, off camera I think it was, told us that if you look at the total number of words and terms that a physician leaving medical school owns in their mind and their vocabulary, it's the equivalent of like two additional full languages of fluency beyond their native language.

But I don't need to read the discussion. I don't need to read the intro. I don't need to read anything else. If it's something that I know less about, then I usually do exactly what you say. I try to start with the figures. I usually end up generating more questions like, what do you mean? What is this? How did they do that? And then I got to go back and read methods, typically. And one of the other things that's probably worth mentioning is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information that are not attached to the paper. You're amazed at how much stuff gets put in the supplemental section. And the reason for that, of course, is that the journals are very specific on the format and length of a paper. So a lot of the times when you're submitting something, if you want to put any additional information in there, it can't go in the main article. It has to go in the supplemental figure. So even for this paper, there were a couple of the numbers I spouted off that I had to pull out of the supplemental paper. For example, when they did the sensitivity analysis on the censoring versus non censoring that was in a supplemental figure that was actually not even in the paper."

I must say, I love, love, love this paper, and I don't often say that about papers. I'm so excited about this paper for so many reasons, but I want to give a couple of caveats up front. First of all, the paper is not published yet. The only reason I was able to get this paper is because it's on biorxiv. There's a new trend over the last, I don't say five, six years of people posting the papers that they've submitted to journals for peer review online so that people can look at them prior to those papers being peer reviewed. So there is a strong possibility that the final version of this paper, which, again, we will provide a link to, is going to look different, maybe even quite a bit different than the one that we're going to discuss. Nonetheless, there are a couple of things that make me confident in the data that we're about to talk about. First of all, the group that published this paper is really playing in their wheelhouse. This is what they do, and they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area. I'm going to mispronounce her first name, but I think it's Chaosigu, who's at the Econ School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, runs a laboratory there studying addiction in humans. And the first author of the paper is Ophir Pearl. This paper is wild, and I'll just give you a couple of the takeaways. First as a bit of a hook to hopefully entice people into listening further, because this is an important paper. This paper basically addresses how our beliefs about the drugs we take impacts how they affect us at a real level, not just at a subjective level, but at a biological level. So just to back up a little bit, a former guest on this podcast, Doctor Ally Crumb, whose name is actually Alea Crumb, but she goes by Allie Crumb, talked about belief effects. Belief effects are different than placebo effects. Placebo effects are really just category effects. It's okay. I'm going to give you this pill, Peter, and I'm going to tell you that this pill is molecule X 5952 and that it's going to make your memory better. And then I give you a memory test, and your group performs better than the people in the control group who I give a pill to. And I say, this is just a placebo. Or there are other variants on this where people will get a drug, and you tell them it's placebo. They'll get a placebo. You tell them it's drug. It's a binary thing. It's an on or off thing. You're either in the drug group or the placebo group, and you're either told that you're getting drug or placebo. And we know that placebo effects exist. In fact, one of the crueler ones. I was never the subject of this, but there was kind of lore in high school that kids would do this mean thing. It's a form of bullying. I really don't like it where they get some kid at a party to drink alcohol free beer, and then that kid would start acting drunk, and then they go, gotcha. It doesn't even have alcohol in it. Now, that's a mean joke. And just reminds me of some of the horrors of high school. Maybe that's why I didn't go very often, which I also don't suggest, but no, it's a mean joke, but it speaks to the placebo effect. Right. And there's also a social context effect. So placebo effects are real. We know this. Belief effects are different. Belief effects are not a or b, placebo or non placebo. Belief effects have a lot of knowledge to enrich one's belief about a certain something that can shift their psychology and physiology one way or the other. And I think the best examples of these belief effects really do come from Ally Crump's lab in the psychology department at Stanford. Although some of this work she did prior to getting to Stanford. For instance, if people are put into a group where they watch a brief video, just a few minutes of video, about how stressed really limits our performance, let's say at archery or at mathematics or at music or at public speaking. And then you test them in any of those domains or other domains, in a stressful circumstance, they perform less well. Okay. And we know they perform less well because we're. By virtue of a heightened stress response. You can measure heart rate, you can measure stroke, volume of the heart. You can measure peripheral blood flow, which goes down when people are stressed, narrowing a vision, etcetera. You take a different group of people and randomly assign them to another group where now they're being told that stress enhances performance. It mobilizes resources, it narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better, et cetera, et cetera. And their performance increases above a control group that receives just useless information, or at least useless as it relates to the task. So in both cases, by the way, the groups are being told the truth. Stress can be depleting or it can enhance performance. But this is different than placebo, because now it's scaling according to the amount and the type of information that they're getting."

Makes you, let's say, I think that if we were to just put a rough percentage on this, it would be somewhere between ten and 30% worse at performance than the control group. And stress is enhancing, is approximately equivalent improvement. So they're in opposite directions. Even more striking is the studies that Ali's lab did and others looking at. For instance, you give people a milkshake. You tell them it's a high calorie milkshake, has a lot of nutrients, and then you measure ghrelin secretion in the blood. And Ghrelin is a marker of hunger that increases the longer it's been since you've eaten. And what you notice is that it suppresses Ghrelindeh to a great degree. And for a long period of time, you give another group a shake. You tell them it's a low calorie shake, that it's got some nutrients in it, but that doesn't have much fat, not much sugar, etcetera. They drink the shake, less ghrelin suppression, and it's the same shake, and it's the same shake. And satiety lines up with that also in that study. And then the third one, which is also pretty striking, is they took hotel workers, they gave them a short tutorial, or not informing them that moving around during the day and vacuuming and doing all that kind of thing is great. It helps you lower your bmI, which is great for your health, incentivize them, and then you let them out into the wild of their everyday job. You measure their activity levels. The two groups don't differ. They're doing roughly the same task, leaning down, cleaning out trash cans, etcetera. Guess what? The group that was informed about the health benefits of exercise lose 12% more weight compared to the other group, and."

That Allie told us, because it just really speaks to how really smart people think. They sit back and they go, yeah, exercise obviously has benefits, but what if a lot of the benefits are that you tell yourself it's good for you and the brain can actually activate these mechanisms in the body?

And to make a long story short, we know that nicotine vaped, smoked, dipped, or snuffed, or these little zinn pouches, or taken in capsule form, does improve cognitive performance. I'm not suggesting people run out and start doing any of those things. I did a whole episode on nicotine. The delivery device often will kill you some other way or is bad for you, but it causes vasoconstriction, which is also not good for certain people. But nicotine is cognitive enhancing. Why? Well, you have a couple sites in the brain, namely in the basal forebrain nucleus, basalis in the back of the brain, structures like locus coeruleus, but also this, what's called. It's got a funny name, the pedunculopontine nucleus, which is this nucleus in the. In the pons, in the back of the brain, in the brainstem, that sends those little axon wires into the thalamus. The thalamus is a gateway for sensory information, and in the thalamus, the visual information, the auditory information, it has nicotinic receptors. And when the pedunculopontine nucleus releases nicotine, or when you ingest nicotine, what it does is it increases the signal to noise of information coming in through your senses. So the fidelity of the signal that gets up to your cortex, which is your conscious perception of those senses, is increased."

        "text": "Of which there are at least seven and probably like 14 subtypes, but so, right, they're called nicotinic receptors in an annoying way, in the same way that cannabinoid receptors are called cannabinoid receptors. But then everyone thinks, oh, you know, those receptors are there because we're supposed to smoke pot, or those receptors are there because we're supposed to ingest nicotine. No, the drugs that named after the receptor that's right, exactly. Receptor is named after the drug. And so the important thing to know is that whether or not it's basal forebrain or pedunculopontine nucleus or locus coeruleus, that, at least in the brain, because we're not talking about muscle, where acetylcholine does something else via nicotinic receptors, in general, it just tends to be a signal to noise enhancer. And so for the non engineering types out there, no problem. Signal to noise. Just imagine I'm talking right now, and there's a lot of static in the background. There are two ways for you to be able to hear me more clearly. We can reduce the static, or I can increase the fidelity, the volume, and the clarity of what I'm saying, for instance. And that's really what acetylcholine does. That's why when people smoke a cigarette, they get that boost of nicotine, and they just feel clear. It really works. The other thing that happens is the thalamus sends information to a couple of places. First of all, it sends information to the reward centers of the brain, the mesolimbic reward pathway that releases dopamine. And typically, when nicotine is increased in our system, dopamine goes up. That's one of the reasons why nicotine is reinforcing. We just like it. We seek it out. I've done beautiful experiments with honeybees, even where you put nicotine on certain plants, or it comes from certain plants, and they'll forage there more, you get them kind of like buzzed. That was a pun. Bad punk. In any event, there's also an output from this thing, the thalamus, to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is an area of the forebrain that really allows us to limit our focus and our attention for sake of learning, which allows us to pay attention. This is the circuit."

But kids with ADD ADHD tend to have a hard time engaging their mind for other types of tasks and other types of tasks are important for getting through life, and it turns out that giving those stimulant drugs, in many cases, can enhance the function of that circuit, and it can strengthen so that ideally, the kids don't need the drugs in the long run, although that's not often the way that it plays out. And there are other ways to get at this. You know, there's now a big battle out there, you know, is ADHD real? Is it not real? Of course it's real. Does every kid need ADHD meds? No. Are there other things, like nutrition, more playtime outside, et cetera, that can help improve their symptoms without drugs? Yes. Is the combination of all those things together known to be most beneficial? Yes. Are the dosages given too high and generally should be titrated down? Maybe. Some kids need a lot. Some kids need a little. I probably just gained and lost a few enemies there. So the point is that these circuits are hardwired circuits."

Again, it was reflecting on this how when we were growing up, people would smoke on plane, that a smoking section on the plane, people smoked all the time. And now hardly anyone smokes, for all the obvious reasons. But, yeah, it provides that really ideal balance between being alert but being mellow and relaxed in the body. So hence its reinforcing properties. Okay. This study is remarkable because what they did is they had people come into the laboratory, they gave them a vape pen. These are smokers. So these are experienced smokers. Typically there's a washout before they come in. So they're not smoking for a bit. So they can clear their system of nicotine and they measure."

So then what they do is they have them vape and they're vaping either a low, medium, or high dose of nicotine. The doses just don't really matter because tolerance varies, et cetera. And then they are putting them into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine. So where they can look at, it's really blood flow, it's really hemodynamic response. For those of you who want to know, it's the ratio of the oxygenated to deoxygenated blood, because when blood will flow to neurons that are active to give it oxygen, and then it's deoxygenated, and then there's a change in what's called the bold signal. So, fMRI, when you see these hotspots in the brain, is really just looking at blood flow, and then there's some interesting physics around.

So by the relaxation at a different rate, you can also get not just resting state activation, like, oh, look at a banana. What areas of the brain light up?

There are a number of little confounds that maybe we won't go into now that have been basically worked out over the last ten years by doing the following. You can't just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing. I'll just tell you the experiment, it was discovered, for instance, that when someone would move their right hand, because when you're in the MRI and just went for one of these recently, for a clinical, not a problem, but just for a diagnostic scan, you're leaning back and you can move your right hand a bit and they would see an area in the motor cortex lighting up. But what they noticed was that the area corresponding to the left hand was also lighting up. So what you really have to do is you have to look at resting state. How much are they lighting up? Just at rest, and then subtract that out. So now you'll always see resting state versus activation state."

Putting elephants on LSD that were published in science and things like crazy experiments. We should definitely do a crazy experiments journal club. In any event, you can get a sense of which brain areas are active and when with fairly high spatial resolution, fairly high and pretty good temporal resolution on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. But it's not ultra fast because a lot of neural transmission is happening on the tens of milliseconds, especially when you're talking about auditory processing. They put people into the scanner and then they give them essentially a task that's designed to engage the thalamus, known to engage the thalamus reward centers and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. And it's a very simple game. You'll like this because you have a background in finance. You let people watch a market. Okay, heres the stock market. Or you could say the price of peas. It doesnt really matter. It goes up, it goes down, and theyre looking at a squiggle line, then it stops, and then they have the option. But they have to pick one option. Theyre either going to invest a certain number of the hundred units that youve given them, or they can short it. They can say its going to go down and try and make money on the prediction. Its going to go down. You could explain shorting better than I could, for sure. So depending on whether or not they get the prediction right or wrong, they get more points or they lose points and they're going to be rewarded in real money at the end of the experiment. So this is going to engage this type of circuitry. Now, remember, these groups were given a vape pen prior to this, where they've vaped. What they were told is either a low, medium or high dose of nicotine. And they do this task. The goal is not to get them to perform better on the task. The goal is to engage the specific brain areas that are relevant to this kind of error and reward type circuits. And we know that this task does that. So that includes the thalamus, that includes the mesolimbic reward pathway and dopamine. It includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. First of all, they measure nicotine in the blood. They are measuring how much people vaped. They were very careful about this. One of the nice things about the vape pen for the sake of experiment and not recommending people vape, but they can measure how much nicotine is left in the vape pen before. After they can measure how long they inhaled, how long they held it in. There's a lot that you can do that's harder to do with a cigarette. Okay. They measured people's belief as to whether or not they got low, medium, or high amounts of nicotine. They were told, they were told they got either this is a low amount, a medium amount, or a high amount. And then, of course, they looked at brain area activation during this task, and what they found was very straightforward."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yes. This is the sneak. I was going to offer it as a punchline, but that's okay. No, I think that the cool thing about this experiment is that the subjects are unaware that they all got the exact same amount of relatively low nicotine containing vape pen. So they basically, and they're measuring it from their bloodstream. So they all have fairly low levels of nicotine. But one group was told, you got a lot. One group was told, you got a medium amount, and the other was told, you got a little bit. Now, a number of things happen, but the most interesting things are the following. First of all, people's subjective feeling of being on the drug matches what they were told. So if they were told, hey, this is a high amount of nicotine. Like, yeah, it feels like a high amount of nicotine. And these are experienced smokers. If it was a medium amount, they're like, man, that feels like a medium amount. If it's a low amount, they think it was a low amount. Now, that's perhaps not so surprising. That's just placebo in. That's the placebo effect. But if you look at the activation of the thalamus in the exact regions where you would predict acetylcholine transmission to impact the function of the thalamus, these include areas like what's called the centromedian nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, the names that really don't matter. But these are areas involved in attention. It scales with what they thought they got in the vape pen, meaning if you were told that you got a low amount of nicotine, you got a little bit of activation in these areas. If you were told that you got a medium amount of nicotine, and that's what you vaped, then you had medium amounts or moderate amounts of activation. And if you were told you got high amounts of nicotine, you got a high degree of activation. And the performance on the task, believe it or not, scales with it somewhat. So keep in mind, everyone got the exact same amount of nicotine in reality. So here, the belief effect isn't just changing what one subjectively experiences. Oh, this is the effect of high nicotine or low nicotine. It actually is changing the way that the brain responds to the belief. And that, to me, is absolutely wild. Now, there are a couple of other things that that could have confounded this. First of all, it could have been that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine, you're just faster or you're reading the lines better, or your response time to hit the button is quicker. I tell you, you have a drug that's going to improve reaction time. You might believe that about nicotine, and so you're quicker on the trigger and you're getting. They have a destination."

People that were told that they got a moderate amount of nicotine got a more robust activation of that pathway. And the people that were told that they got a high amount of nicotine in the vape pen saw a very robust activation of the thalamus to this ventral prefrontal cortical pathway.

This is not that, but you can look at the timing of activation, and it's a known, what we call monosynaptic pathway. So we haven't talked so much about figures here, but I guess if we were going to look at any one figure, and I can just describe it for the audience that's not paying, doesn't have the figure in front of them. Let's see, the most important figure is figure two. Remember I said I like to read the titles of figures, which is that the belief about nicotine strength induced a dose dependent response in the thalamus. Basically, if you and figure two, b, can tell you if they believe that they got more nicotine, that's essentially the response that they saw. Sorry, panel e, if you look at the belief rating as a function of the estimate in thalamus of how much activation there was, it's a mess when you look at all the dots at once. But if you just separate it out by high, medium and low, you run the statistics, what you find is that, that there's a gradual increase, but a legitimate one, from low to medium to high. In other words, if I tell you this is a high dose of nicotine, your brain will react as if it's a high dose of nicotine. Now, what they didn't do was give people zero nicotine."

It's unclear whether or not they had been drunk previously, if they even knew what it would be like to feel drunk, et cetera. And there's the social context. What I find just outrageous and outrageously interesting about this study is simply that. But what we are told about the dose of a drug changes the way that our physiology responds to the dose of the drug. And in my understanding, this is the first study to ever look at dose dependence of belief effects. Why would that be important? Well, for almost every study of drugs, you look at a dose dependent curve. You look at zero, low dose, medium dose, high dose.

If figure three talks about their belief about nicotine strength did not modulate the reward response, the dopamine response, how was that measured?"

If people got a low, medium or high amount of nicotine, now, that actually could be leveraged. I believe if somebody were trying to quit nicotine, for instance, and they were going to do that by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine that they were taking. But you told them that it was the same amount from one day to the next, you could whittle it down to, presumably to a low amount before taking it to zero. And if they believed it to be a greater amount, then it might actually not disrupt their reward pathways. Meaning they would feel. Presumably they'd feel rewarded by whatever nicotine they were bringing in."

One of the challenges that they note in this study was you have to stay very still in the machine. But the subjects were constantly coughing because they're smokers. Okay. So presumably the data would be higher fidelity. Started chuckling at that one, but I was like, had to read that one twice. I was like, oh, that makes sense. They're smokers, they're coughing, they can't stay still. So movement, artifact. But in all seriousness, I think that for people that are naive to nicotine, even a small amount of nicotine is likely to get this pathway activated to such a great degree. Sort of like the first time effect of pretty much any drug."

I just think it's so very cool that they're starting to explore dose dependence of belief, because that has all sorts of implications. I mean, use your imagination, folks. Whether or not we're talking about a drug, we're talking about a behavioral intervention, we're talking about a vaccine. And I'm not referring to any one specific vaccine. I'm just talking to vaccines generally. I'm talking about psychoactive drugs, I'm talking about illicit drugs, I'm talking about antidepressants, I'm talking about all the sorts of drugs we were talking about before metformin, et cetera. Just throw our arms around all of it. What we believe about the effects of a drug, presumably in addition to what we believe about how much we're taking and what those effects ought to be, clearly are impacting at least the way that our brain reacts to those drugs."

So, again, I think the GLP one agonists are such a great example of this. Yeah. I don't think anybody fully understands exactly how they're working, but it's hard to argue that they're impacting that. The GLP one analog is having a central impact. It's doing something in the brain that is leading to a reduction of appetite."

        "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's no quicker way to make a mouse overeat or under eat than by lesioning its hypothalamus, depending on where you do so. So presumably these drugs work there. But again, it speaks to, like, what do you need to believe in order for that to be the case?"

        "speaker": "A",

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, of course, those drugs have all been tested via placebo and the placebo groups, you know, don't do anywhere near as well. That's how we know that there's activity of the drug. But again, there's, you know, that's a little bit different than being told you are absolutely getting it. Right, because in the RCT's you're just told you might be getting it, you might not be getting it. So it's not quite the same as this experiment. This experiment is one level up where you're being told, no, you're absolutely getting it, you're just getting different doses of it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. To take this to maybe the ADHD realm, let's say a kid has been on ADHD meds for a while and the parents, for whatever reason, the physician decide they want to cut back on the dosage, but if they were to tell the kid it's the same dosage they've always been taking and it's had a certain positive effect for them, according to the results, at least in this paper, which are not definitive, but are interesting, the lower dose may be as effective simply on the basis of belief. And this is the part that makes it so cool to me, is that. And it's not a kid tricking themselves or the parents tricking the kid, so much as the brain activation is corresponding to the belief. Belief. Right. So that's where this is why, because it's done in the brain. I think we can, you know, it gets to these kind of abstract, nearly mystical, but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects, which is that, you know, your brain is a prediction making machine, it's a data interpretation machine. But it's clear that one of the more important pieces of data are your beliefs about how these things impact you. So it's not that this bypasses physiology, people aren't diluting themselves. The thalamus is behaving as if it's a high dose when it's the same dose as the low dose. Group wild."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think of the implications, for example, of blood pressure. We don't really understand essential hypertension, which is the majority of people walking around with high blood pressure. It's unclear etiology, so lots of people being treated. How do we know that the belief system about it can't be changed? And, yeah, this is. This is. I don't know, this is eye opening."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, it's cool stuff. And alley crumb is onto some other really cool stuff, like, for instance, just to highlight where these belief effects are starting to show up. If you tell a group that the side effects of a drug that they're taking are evidence that the drug really works for the purpose that they're taking it. Even though those side effects are kind of annoying, people report the experience as less awful, and they report more relief from the primary symptoms that they're trying to target. So our belief about what side effects are that's so interesting can really impact how quickly and how compatible we feel about how quickly a drug works. Excuse me. And how compatible we feel that drug is with our entire life. So maybe if we call them something else, like, not side effects, but, like, additional benefits or something, it's kind of crazy. And you don't want to lie to people, obviously, but you also don't want to send yourself in the opposite direction, which is reading the list of side effects of a drug and then developing all of those side effects, and then maybe later coming to the understanding that some of those were raised through belief."

I think there are some people who are really impacted by that, and it makes it very difficult for them to take any sort of pharmacologic agent because they basically can't help but incur every possible side effect."

There are certain conditions that you spend so much time thinking about that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence. In medical school, there's this condition called sarcoidosis.
