        "text": "In recent months, the us government has been cracking down on the crypto industry in a number of ways. Let's start with what appears to be the first inkling of a more coordinated effort, which Nick, I believe you dubbed Operation Choke Point two point zero. And you first identified this in a pirate wires article. And I was wondering if he could explain what Operation Choke .2.0 is and what evidence you have that this is actually happening."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Sure. So the name obviously is a callback to Choke Point. It was just called Operation Chokepoint, which was actually the official government name, which was took place from about 2012 to 2017 with varying degrees of intensity. And it was an attempt to basically marginalize certain industries in the US by persuading the banks not to do business with them. And the primary agencies that were responsible for this was the FDIC in conjunction with the DOJ, and the OCC was involved to a lesser extent. And the primary targets were just politically unfavored industries. So payday lending, I would say, is the number one target of choke. .1.0 some other industries were also targeted, like firearms manufacturing. And basically the objective was to marginalize those industries, not through Congress or any sort of formal process, but by having the bank regulators tell the banks that there was reputational risk in serving those industries. And that was the problem was that it wasn't really done through legal means, it was done by insinuation and by casting aspersions against the industry and suggesting to the banks that they would face reputational risks and more onerous oversight if they banked them. And it was pretty successful. Now 2.0 is similar, I would say it's more explicit actually. It's less subtle, it's less under the table, it's more overt, it's in plain sight for the most part. And the target is the crypto space. So of course there's a lot to discuss, regulatory perspective with regards to crypto. So of course there's the SEC and the CFTC and there's all of those undertakings. But the primary thing that I'm calling choke .2.0 is happening through bank regulation and it is coordinated for sure. It concerns the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC and also the administration itself. And the evidence that I started to see really became clear in January. Our portfolio companies reported to us they were having trouble with their banking. Certain bank executives I talked to indicated to me that they were facing more onerous data requests from their regulators. Of course we saw what happened to Silvergate and signature. Those aren't evidence on their face, but certainly the circumstances of signatures receivership were suspicious given that its probably the first fully solvent bank that was put into receivership in the US. And this is a large bank, so lots of suspicions around that, including what Barney Frank had to say. But I would say the evidence is simply the fact that starting in January really all these agencies started saying at the same time that banks serving the crypto space was a threat to the safety and soundness of these banks. We now know over and above that, that the Fed and the FDIC have been pressuring banks not to do business with the crypto space. And I'm sure more evidence will come out in time. But I'd say the totality of the evidence you can also point to the disapproval of custodia's license and the troubled state of the federally chartered crypto institutions like Portego. I think the totality of the evidence suggests very clearly now that there is a coordinated cross agency attempt to really limit the ability of the crypto industry to obtain banking in the US. And so thats why I call it choke point two point zero."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, obviously, when startups raise capital, one of the first things you do is just got a bank relationship, and that should be trivial. Any legal business in the US should not have trouble obtaining banking. But the reality today is there's only a handful of banks that service crypto firms, the ones that do face higher costs for doing that if they're perceived to be crypto friendly banks. And so it's not worth it for them to take on smaller clients for the most part. Additionally, banks face these de facto limits on the how many deposits they can take on. There's these informal thresholds that are now messaged to banks in the 1015 percent range today. Post Silvergate and signature collapses, no bank can be an explicitly holy crypto bank. The banks that are doing business with the crypto space have these effective limits of deposits that they can take. Basically, if you're a crypto company, you go to any of these banks that are known to service crypto, you'll still have trouble persuading them to take you on as client. A lot of banks just have a straight up ban on crypto. They'll just say, we literally don't service businesses that do crypto stuff. And the banks that do are pretty averse to giving you actual merchant accounts. So if you think of an exchange where you're processing transactions on behalf of your clients wires in and out, that is sort of the more full service type banking engagement that is extremely hard to get today. So if youre a crypto firm, you go to a bank, you ask for an account, they may give you an operating account, basically just for cash management. But going for the Fuller merchant account, thats extraordinarily difficult today. And thats the unfortunate reality."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, thanks, Laura. I cant speak to any one specific company, but generally we have seen Portcos being debanked. That said, so far, all of our Portcos have found banking partners, but it highlights, I think, the importance of smaller and regional banks in the US. Startup ecosystem. There needs to be banks and institutions that service that industry and that know that business model generally. Thinking about this from a first principles standpoint, banks are in the business of accepting risk and managing risk, and banks manage risk from the unique characteristics of the customer and the industry. And crypto is no different. Crypto businesses can pose risk to banks, but they have tools to manage those risks, just like they have tools to manage risks of other types of industries and other specific types of companies, especially when it comes to diversification across very large balance sheets. Again, even maybe stepping higher than that, above the banking sector. The regulation of banks is supposed to be an objective, partially subjective, but objective safety and soundness practice. It is not supposed to be a policy vehicle for value judgments or for ideology to express its viewpoint. And we have a system in the United States where political accountability is supposed to be built in to policy decisions. And when you start getting into more of the regulatory apparatus of independent bank agencies, that really starts to go away pretty quickly. And so there do appear to be a lot of questions. I think Nick raised a lot of strong evidence. There appears to be a lot of smoke, and I think the american public and certainly the crypto industry, deserve answers to those questions."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. And just to fill in some of the details that I heard from another source who has experience in both Tradfi and crypto, I'll just call this person X. They said of their experience working at a crypto company, we were told by a bank, no guns, no cannabis, no crypto, based on the direction they had received from their regulators. And X also, and this kind of fills out something that Nick mentioned, said that some banks are required to file cras, which are crypto related activity reports monthly. And then, drawing on X's tradfi experience, they said, I know how it works. I've been in the room with the OCC. When they squeeze banks, they have very punitive tools. Stress tests for the globally systemic important banks, GSIBs. These include qualitative and quantitative tests. They will require incremental staffing, reporting, et cetera. For instance, banks that continue to service crypto companies. And so one example would be like, they would force that bank to have a higher minimum of regulatory capital per unit of crypto industry deposits or exposure to crypto. And then, so their assessment was, if it's a new industry and has limited revenue, they will kill you with overhead to make it very unprofitable, for instance, requiring these cras. And then they noted that this is kind of being incorporated into the Basel requirements, which are big requirements on banks. And they sent me a link, which I can include in the show notes. But I took a look and from my understanding, there's what they call group one assets in group two. And group one is tokenized real world assets, or I, um, kind of more conservative stable coins. And then group two is, um, all other cryptos. And then sort of like riskier stable coins. And group two obviously has like much more onerous. If you have more exposure to that, then that has more onerous requirements. You know, this person's assessment was, if you're a senior banker, you spend most of your time trying to optimize regulatory capital and returns on regulatory capital for crypto. They punish you by making reg cap very expensive. And then, like Nick said, they added, of course, then it's harder. Even if you get a bank account, it would be super hard to get things like a loan. Yeah, I don't know if you wanted to add on that, but I just wanted to, because it is a leap to say, okay, this is happening. I mean, we can sort of see this trend, but now just the more voices that we have on this, I feel the more it kind of fills out the picture."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, I think to put a finer point on that, and I think this is accurate. I haven't looked at it for a little while, but I think the Basel committee came out with a 1250% risk rating for crypto assets, which category too, which added, you know, an 8% capital, you know, requirement equates to a dollar for. It equates to 100% capital requirement. So it equates to holding dollar for dollar against any type of crypto asset. Banks are a business. They don't do things for free. They do have to maximize regulatory capital. And I have always felt that some of the seeds to the next financial crisis are laid in the regulatory constraints of the present day and how that creates management issues, incentives that steer activity towards the most advantaged regulatory products, and that's where all of the interest goes. And then you leave things that have massive potential innovation benefit behind."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I'll just add to that. I mean, the red cap question, that's a very explicit way of raising the cost. But frankly, most banks don't want to hold crypto directly. A lot of what were talking about is simply banks doing business from a fiat perspective with firms that touch blockchains or their software providers for the crypto space, and theres implicit costs there. So certainly what bank executives are telling me on a widespread basis is if you are engaging with crypto depositors, you just fundamentally face more scrutiny, higher demands for more stepped up AML KYC requirements, and more frequent and burdensome data requests. So it's my understanding now that the FDIC does make these crypto specific data requests on an ongoing basis that began in about q four of last year. So if you think about it, if you're a smallish bank and you're not exclusively focused on crypto, which is the case today, there's no banks left that really have crypto as their sole purview. It becomes very costly to have 10% or 15% of your book be crypto related because you have a higher fixed cost. You're considered to be a higher risk institution or facing a higher risk industry. Those costs are almost not worth it at that point because the revenue you're earning from crypto, if it's a smaller share of your depositor base, is less. So it's kind of a bit of a catch 22. I know the Fed says they don't really want banks to have depository bases that are correlated, but if you're a smallish bank and you only have 1015 percent of your deposits that pertain to the crypto industry, the costs almost become not worth it. So it's a bit of a catch 22, the combination of those two things."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, that's an important point, Nick. There is a lot of soft power, an immense amount of soft power that a bank examiner or the bank regulatory community has through things like paperwork requirements. All of a sudden, and I've heard this directly from a senior executive at a globally systemic important institution, that if they were to take on any crypto business, the sheer amount of paperwork that they would have to complete just does not make it worth their department's time. So there are ways to not prohibit it, but effectively disincentivize it to the point where it is no longer bankable."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. And so a lot of these things are just different ways to pressure banks to not deal with crypto companies. But I did want to also highlight something from the National Economic Council statement back from January 27, which says, quote, of legislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions like pension funds to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets. In the past year, traditional financial institutions limited exposure to cryptocurrencies has prevented turmoil and cryptocurrencies from infecting the broader financial system. It would be a grave mistake to enact legislation that reverses course and deepens the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system. So between what we've been discussing, like, some of that is sort of behind the scenes, and then this part is just sort of explicitly being like, don't do it. So there's so many directions we could go from here."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Well, Laura, I mean, let me just chime in there. I mean, I was at the CFTC in March of 2020 when there was a massive dislocation in the treasury markets, supposedly the most, deepest and most liquid markets in the world, with the most secure, supposedly risk free asset. And at the same time, the price of oil in the futures market went negative. So we do live in a world where volatility exists, and it expresses itself in a number of ways in a number of different products and venues. And the point cannot be to eliminate risk from the financial system, because then you eliminate the financial system, and people can answer for themselves whether or not that's their true goal. But the point is to appropriately manage risk within the financial system through the tools that we have that have come to evolve."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, and if I may add, prior to the current banking crisis, there were a lot of statements from various regulators that, similar to the NEC statement there, that they wanted to insulate the traditional financial system from the purported risks of the crypto space. But if you look at the ultimate causes of the bank crisis that we're now experiencing, crypto is not the cause. Right. There had been worries that perhaps stablecoins would perturb the treasury market if there was a run on a stable coin, all the treasuries were sold off. That was one of the worries. There were also worries that there was concentration in the banks that focus on crypto and that that might cause a financial crisis. But really, from my perspective, the ultimate cause is simply whipsawing interest rates, interest rates that rose really quickly and caused the value of the assets that the banks conventional banks, were holding to fall. And then combined with some of the liquidity risks that, for instance, we saw with SBB, with the flighty depositors. But this is a global problem. It's not confined to crypto. The banks that are now imperiled Credit Suisse didn't have anything to do with crypto. For instance, SVBH had, as far as I can tell, one crypto client. So the ultimate cause of this bank crisis is not a crypto thing. But the regulator sure gave it a lot of airtime, the idea that the risks from crypto could somehow infect the traditional financial system. But that's not where I would apportion the blame for this current crisis."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I agree with that, Nick. I mean, look, the banking system exists solely because of confidence in it. If everyone rushes to a bank and withdraws their money, the fractional reserve banking system cannot survive, which is why you have a regulatory structure designed to prevent bank runs and ensure confidence. And it was no accident, I think, that as Silvergate was running into difficulties and sold through their treasury security portfolios and took on a huge loss, I think we can debate whether or not that was actually the best decision as opposed to doing something else with it, like going through repo. But in realizing that loss, it's probably crystallized in a lot of people's minds, well, geez, if it can happen to that bank and they have to sell securities and they're going to take huge losses, where else could that happen? The point of regulation is to prevent panics, and unfortunately, regulators acted know after that panic had occurred."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So Silvergate received a $4.3 billion loan from the federal Home loan Bank of San Francisco. For reasons unknown, they decided to pay it back in full just days before it shut down. And I think you guys probably saw that article in Coindesk, where a spokesperson for Suffragate told Coindesk, FHL Bank San Francisco did not request or compel Silvergate bank to prepay its outstanding advances. Silvergate made their determination to prepay their outstanding advances based on their own assessment of their position. So this is confounding to me. What do you think happened there? Did Silvergate make a mistake in their risk assessment, which then caused them to shut down just a few days later? Or do you think they're kind of hiding what happened about being, you know, having to pay it back? Or what do you think happened there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, you're right to zero in on this. This is one of the two main catalysts for the dissolution of Silvergate, and there's enormous open questions there. So the FHLB denied that they explicitly compelled Silvergate to repay the loan. But it's absolutely the case that there was a very active political pressure campaign against the FHLB when it became clear that Silvergate was using that facility to honor their withdrawals. So it would not surprise me if Silvergate was considering that and realizing that they perhaps could be imminently cut off from that facility. It was also a short term rolling facility. So a non renewal is tantamount to forcing them to pay back the loans. But you're right, because that was the decision that basically precipitated their, their liquidation. And so a bank doesnt just commit suicide like that. So I think theres still enormous open questions as to what specifically happened there and whether the political pressure that the FHLB was getting contributed in any way to that, to the paying back of the loan."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I think I would just say what I had said before, which is, look, there are a lot of questions here. The longer those questions go unanswered, the longer a lack of confidence is going to remain in both either the motivations of the parties involved or in the solvency of any individual institution. If you're just a retail participant and reading the front page headlines, the one."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Thing I would say about Silvergate, and this also applies to Silicon Valley, is I think that what happened with both of those things demonstrates how important it is to diversify your clientele, because if an industry gets affected in one way or another, or there might be similar behaviors or characteristics among that clientele, which would expose you to more risk. So that's just one thing. But I don't think it's necessarily. It doesn't have to do with what we just said so much as just a general banking best practices type of comment. But I also wanted to talk about signature, because that was another one that is very confusing, because obviously First Republic was in a worse situation, but that one was able to get saved. And, you know, with signature, it sort of seemed to be preemptively closed. And I know, Nick, you've talked at length about what you think the irregularities are there. Actually, one thing that I do want to note for people who listen to the show with Caitlin Long and meltem, is that meltem Demirs is that. I was not aware of this at the time we recorded. It turns out, technically, it is legal for the regulate for the New York Department of Financial Services to and put a bank into receivership if they feel that they're not getting good data, which is interesting to me, it doesn't seem like that should be possible, in my personal opinion. But I did want to correct that fact there because it didn't occur to me that actually was legal, because it just sounds like it shouldn't be legal. But, Nick, can you elaborate a little bit on what the regulator is with signature?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Sure. Yeah, you're right. The New York banking law is extremely broad with the set of conditions that would render it permissible for DF's to put a bank into receivership. And that is one. So DF's noted a crisis of confidence in leadership and insufficient data as their primary justifications for putting them into receivership. I think that situation needs to be looked into. Absolutely. Because if Barney Frank, who is on the board at signature. If his allegations are true, then it's very unusual to have a solvent bank put into receivership. I'm not sure I could name another example in us history when that's happened. The timing is odd as well. SVB was closed on Friday afternoon. Signature wasn't until Sunday night. Typically, it's done on Friday, and then there's the weekend for the FDIC to try and shop the assets or arrange an acquisition to basically close it in orderly fashion. That didn't occur in this case. You have Barney Frank's allegations, and then, frankly, you have the treatment of the crypto deposits at signature, where ultimately the buyer of signature did not assume either Cygnet, which is their fiat settlement network, which was the biggest of the two between Cen and Cygnet, and they did not assume the crypto deposits. The crypto deposits were, the FDIC told crypto depositors, and by crypto deposits, I mean fiat deposits of crypto firms that were clients of signature. The FDIC told them to withdraw the remaining 4 billion. So that portion of their business, which was a very material part of signatures business, was ultimately not included in the sale to NYCB, I believe it is. So thats an open question on one day, this is a crypto focused bank, or at least cryptos a meaningful portion of their business, and then theyre put into receivership. And then through the acquisition, the assets that are sold include no crypto element whatsoever. So if you wanted to ascribe an anti crypto motive to the receivership, that point of evidence would strongly support that conclusion, I think."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So. We've kind of alluded to this as being something that appears to be coordinated, at least in the banking sector. But at the same time that all this is going on, we are seeing enforcement actions from the SEC against, for instance, Kraken and Coinbase, and then CFTC obviously had its charges against finance. And so when you see kind of what's happening across these different agencies, I wondered if you thought that this was a generally coordinated crackdown on crypto across government agencies, because, you know, it sort of looks like that from the outside based on the timing. But then I also see people joking or surmising that government agencies either don't really cooperate with each other or don't do so effectively. You know, people point out how the SEC and the CFTC are sort of at odds over whether or not cryptos are securities or commodities. And, Brian, I wanted to get your opinion on this, since you used to work in the government, what's your take, is that a conspiracy theory to think that this is a coordinated crackdown, or is that plausible?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Right. Laura, I was a commissioner at the CFTC from 2017 through 2021. And I was there when the futures contracts on bitcoin and ethnic were listed on CFTC registered only exchanges. And they are still listed on CFTC only registered exchanges. So the status of those products is at this point, I think it's not necessarily in doubt. If the SEC views any product as a security, then they can take actions to overtly declare that they can ensure that those contracts are taken down from CFTC registered exchanges. They can file actions against individuals trading those contracts. So none of that has happened. So despite a lot of the language that we're hearing that appears to be creating deliberate vagueness to me, the status of those two products is crystal clear. In terms of your question around a deliberate, coordinated approach. Maybe I'm biased from working with the CFTC, but I see a very strong distinction between, apart from the timing, which I don't know what to make of, but I see a very strong distinction between the CFTC's case against binance and the settlement against Kraken, as well as the seven line wells notice that was submitted by the SEC to Coinbase. The CFTC's complaint stretches back three and a half, four years. It has very detailed text messages, recordings, other kinds of documentation, transcripts around conversations that really seemed to allege a deliberate attempt to evade us laws, while also showing an overt attempt to cater to us customers for a platform that had direct compliance obligations, especially in the derivatives markets. The derivatives laws are very clear. This is not a subjective how we test where people can go and take one prong and then wave it around and say everything's a security. And the derivative laws are very clear about what derivatives are, and that if they are offered to us customers, there are certain registration obligations that have to be followed. Those were not followed in this instance, and they also then created BSA obligations, bank Secrecy act obligations on Binance.com comma, which again, according to the facts that were alleged, they knew about and deliberately tried to work around. So this feels like a very strong and clear case that the agency has brought. And I think from our perspective, and I know Nick agrees with this, in terms of someone that's been so vocal about the potential of this technology. We believe in the world computer aspect of this innovation, not the world casino aspect of this innovation. Unfortunately, it's been hyper financialized. And I think you can see that also in some of the examples shown in the binance case alleged. In the binance case, Binance offered 125 times leverage on some of their products that wouldn't be allowed anywhere in the us derivatives markets, no matter basically what you're trading on. And they also had games and contests where traders could compete over the course of 1 minute to see who made more or lost less in derivative market transactions. I mean, this is not what this technology and this innovation was meant to achieve. This was someone looking at it from the most financialized aspect possible and unfortunately creating a bad name for the ecosystem."

And so I think that there is a completely different promise to this technology, and I think the sooner we get back to that by ensuring that exchanges that are fiat on and off ramps into this ecosystem are complying. And I think coinbase is a great actor in this ecosystem. They spend a tremendous amount of time and resources on compliance. They're a publicly traded company. And again to me, in my mind, a vague wells notice issued by the SEC that could portend some kind of enforcement action to them stands in complete contrast to the very detailed and clear case that the CFTC is bringing against finance."

And I think it's reasonable to ask yourself or anyone to ask themselves or to ask the SEC, why has there not been updated guidance in this ecosystem for the last four years when legacy rules cannot fit the way this technology works and do not apply, and whose underlying rationale aren't applicable to the motivations of anyone that is purchasing a number of these tokens, or the way that a lot of the software is being constructed, it's reasonable to take the view that if no new guidance is being issued and only enforcement is being used, is the only tool to address the space, to go after this space and express a view that is not clear. You know, is that really appropriate? I mean, is that what the securities laws were meant to do? And I think that there are a lot. Again, there are a lot of questions there. I think there will be a lot of questions about that in Congress, and I don't know the quality of the answers that we should expect. I think what that does mean is that it's an extra motivation for Congress, and I think it's a strong one. And I think they're hearing it, that the solution lies with them on how to construct something new that does respect this technology, that does respect consumer protection, that brings a lot of the aspects here into a regulatory fold that is designed appropriately, calibrated thoughtfully. And I'm hopeful that we'll see that. And I'm hearing positive things about that."

I think the SEC, it's been clear what their objective agenda is with regards to the crypto industry for years now. So I don't see any necessary change or discontinuity there. They have maybe become more aggressive recently, but this seems like the ordinary course of business for them. On the banking front, I certainly see coordination. So I wouldn't necessarily tie the actions of the Fed, the FTIC, and the OCC to those of the CFTC and the SEC. On the banking front, I do see a sea change, starting with the collapse of FTX where I believe the banking regulators decided that they needed to use the tools at their disposal to start to limit the access of crypto firms to the traditional banking sector. And certainly when you see an interagency statement covering the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC, that obviously implies a degree of coordination. And when you have the National Economic Council releasing a statement on the same day as the custodial denial, for instance, that clearly implies some coordination. I actually don't think it's the Biden administration's top or even top five priority to marginalize the crypto space. But I do believe that now that Congress is somewhat hamstrung or at least divided between the two parties, the financial regulators, especially banking supervisors, realize that there would likely not be congressional action to stymie crypto for the remaining two years of Biden's term. And I believe that post FTX, they effectively decided to take it upon themselves to limit the reach of the crypto space and certainly limits limit its ability to, quote unquote, infect the traditional banking system. So, yeah, no doubt in my mind that at least with whats called choke, .2.0 that is being coordinated on a cross agency basis."

And then Cooper and Kirk, which is a law firm that had, I think, sued the government over the first operation choke point, did release a white paper kind of collating a lot of the information they had and saying that this was an operation choke .2.0 directed against the crypto industry. One thing before we move on to what I really feel is quite possibly the biggest outcome here, which I think is more in the geopolitical realm, is, let me summarize a little bit what I think you guys are saying, and then we can talk about it. It's that you feel that there needs to be smarter, either legislation or guidance from the agencies, rather than sort of cryptic enforcement actions or punitive ones that don't kind of allow people to follow any rules because there aren't these rules in the first place, but that some of these actions are legitimate, for instance, maybe the one that the CFTC is bringing against binance, and that some of this also is potentially like an overreaction against FTX. Is that a good summary of your thoughts there?"

The best way to disincentivize illicit activity abroad is to have a robust ecosystem here in the United States. I think that goes for the derivatives markets too. We have the most liquid, most transparent, most robust derivatives markets here in the US. And I don't think it's a coincidence that we also have the strongest economy, usually in the world. We only have two derivative products that trade because of the lack of clarity of the status of these tokens. We have derivative contracts on ETH and we have derived contracts on bitcoin. If you want to trade any other derivatives contracts, use them for risk management purposes, which is the foundation of the derivatives markets. You have to go overseas. So the way that you develop more incentives to stay here and more disincentives for those operating illicitly abroad is to provide the clarity which has so far been missing."

And of course, on the securities front, we have no framework whatsoever for how, for a common sense disclosure regime, for instance, for token issuers. And I don't believe that the legacy securities regulation that we have here is fit for purpose. So much work to be done there, and I think that's in the hands of Congress. On the banking front, it's slightly different. I mean, I think we basically have a violation of due process. I would say it's primarily a Fifth Amendment issue. Wherever these regulators are taking it upon themselves to determine who the banks can and cannot deal with, that's a vast overreach. That's not their mandate. Their mandate is to ensure the soundness of these banks. It's not to pick and choose what industries they can serve. So I consider that a significant overreach. And of course, the net effect of that, and the prior thing is that crypto firms are increasingly looking abroad for new homes or they're looking for more crypto native solutions. So instead of holding their funds to the bank, maybe having their balance sheet in stablecoin format. So I think the US benefits from being the world's home for securities markets. The US is something like 25% of global GDP, but 40% of global public equity capitalization. And that's been a huge benefit to this country historically. So I do think they'd be squandering that advantage as they continue down this path and discourage crypto firms from domiciling themselves here."

        "text": "I mean, I certainly don't believe, for myself, I don't believe crypto is a threat to the dollar at all. I mean, what we actually see in the crypto space is the dollarization of the crypto industry. So initially, bitcoin was the sort of medium of exchange and unit of account, and crypto, and increasingly became dollar based. The collateral in smart contracts is primarily dollars. When you have a contract that has some long duration, you want it to be denominated in dollars. You dont want to take on the exchange risk. Stablecoins have infected the crypto space, not in a pejorative way, but they are increasingly the dominant collateral type and medium of exchange. In crypto, theres more value settled in stablecoins than there is in bitcoin or ether. Stablecoins have a higher velocity than those crypto assets. And 99% plus of all stable coins globally use the dollar as their unit of account. Thats far, far more than the dollar share of international trade or of foreign exchange reserves. The other thing is, of course, crypto is a vector for proliferating the usage of the dollar globally. It's a way to give people, effectively, us bank accounts in places where they would never have that access otherwise. It spreads the property rights associated with the us dollar banking system globally. And I think that has a huge welfare benefit to people in emerging markets with unstable currencies. And of course, if you look at the data, you see the places, the highest adoption of crypto are you, Southeast Asia, West Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America. In certain places, you have weak property rights, poor governance, not a lot of rule of law necessarily, and maybe a banking system that can't be trusted, those are the hotspots of crypto adoption. So that tracks with this idea that the export of property rights is part of the appeal. So I think there's tremendous opportunity to embrace the notion of a stable coin, which is just taking the assurances we have of physical cash and digitizing it. But theres so much opposition to that in this country. In January, 1 of the things that really made me sit up was the Fed basically said, we dont want banks issuing stablecoins on public blockchains. They effectively banned that. But itd be better if banks could be the ones issuing stablecoins as opposed to just private firms. Its unclear now what that pathway is going to be to take the existing stablecoins and make them even more credible and give holders even better assurances. The various trust companies that issue stablecoins are sort of imperiled. So I think it's very clear that stablecoins, especially dollar based stablecoins, are one of the key products that the crypto industry is creating, one of the key killer apps of the space. And there is certainly a risk that the crypto space becomes dominated by some other sovereign fiat like euros or whatever it is. So that would be a tremendous shame if we lost that advantage."

And just one comment I'd like to make on that is that one thing that surprised me so much when I wrote my book was that when I was interviewing people who were european or asian or whatever, they would always quote the price of bitcoin or ether to me in dollars, no matter what their home currency was. Nobody ever quoted it in their actual currency. And these were by and large foreigners. And that was just something that struck me. It was very fascinating. But just from that alone, I interviewed more than 200 people from my book. Just from that alone, it definitely felt like, yes, it's getting all these people who don't live in dollars to think in dollars and transact in dollars, which."

A lot of these people literally have no ability to hold dollars in any other format. They certainly don't have access to PayPal or Venmo. Then the dominant currency actually grows its market share. That's what we've seen empirically. Not to mention the fact that the US does need new buyers of treasuries. Foreign central banks are divesting treasuries. There's a lot of net sellers of treasuries out there. Every time you buy a stablecoin from one of the credible issuers, that ends up being expressed in the form of treasury exposure. So theres also that angle. Theres $130 billion, give or take worth of treasuries that are being held by these stablecoin issuers. Thats also a benefit I would point to."

So if you were to encourage a network of onshore stablecoin issuers, all stablecoin issuers still have the ability to determine who is using the network, especially with regards to creation and redemption. They have the ability to freeze tokens on the network. So its not like youre just throwing the currency to the wolves and creating this totally anarchic system. I mean the stablecoin issuers still have discretion over who is using the network. So I think you retain your sanctions making ability if that is the objection to stablecoins. If you discourage the growth of the onshore stablecoin market, you empower the less accountable sort of crypto euro dollar stablecoin issuers that are not doing it onshore. So tether has been a huge beneficiary of all the recent events in the crypto space, as people have basically started to realize that there might be some risks to staying onshore. Of course, USDC was affected to a certain degree by the SBB issues, and a lot of folks have shuffled around their balance sheets and now are holding tethers instead. That can't possibly be something that the financial establishment, the US, is happy about. I mean, tether is completely unaccountable to them. So if you discourage local stablecoin issuance, people still want stable coins, they'll just do it with a less transparent and less accountable entity."

So you can't help but think that there has been some, some level of blessing of that process. Maybe they're creating sandboxes in Hong Kong, right? Maybe they're trying to figure out how to attract development so that they can crowdsource a lot of that innovation. Maybe they want to end up using it for safe purposes. Maybe they want to try to understand how they can better infiltrate the digital yuan into the kind of the crypto ecosystem or into kind of the next web three economy. I mean, it's easy to speculate on a lot of different kinds of things and it's hard to kind of figure out. The thing that worries me is that when we kind of bring up the china aspect in Washington, there are a lot of people that then use that as an excuse to advocate for a us central bank digital currency. And there are so many policy issues that need to be addressed, very difficult policy issues that I think may be hard for Congress to achieve consensus on before a central bank digital currency could even be issued, that it feels like it's a distraction. I would rather kind of focus on the advancements of the technology and who's going to own the next set of that innovation? Who's going to own the tools of Web three? Who's going to be the home of kind of that innovator community? Where is that legal system going to be based? Where is that academic research going to be based? Where are the universities going to be located that attract that kind of talent? Where is the funding community going to be based? Where do daos locate with appropriate legal protections? And where do their treasuries then have the ability to pay taxes and hire third party service providers? I mean, to me, that's more of the geopolitical issue from the United States, which is, given the trajectory we're on, sure, maybe China can make some advancements.

Weve never even seen a historical full reserve banking set up that was market determined that actually existed. So all banking historically is fractional reserve. And I think credit creation is good for society. I think the main reason bitcoin has been rallying is simply that the Fed, in response to the banking crisis, adopted a more accommodative posture and their balance sheet started growing again and they started injecting liquidity into the markets. So that's an exogenous variable to crypto causally ascribe that. The bulk of the explanation, certainly, I think they're going to face further issues trying to restore the confidence in the us banking system. I don't know if an unlimited depository guarantee is a solution, but it certainly does betray the fragility of our current banking system, and I think it implies further liquidity injections down the road. So I would say that's the main reason bitcoin has been rallying here is not any endogenous crypto factors, but simply the broader liquidity environment.

And if you lose that, you lose a strong driver of money creation and GDP growth. So I actually see it being a drag on the economy and destructive to the money supply. The dynamics that we're seeing in the bank sector. Longer term, of course, the existence of the debt as it is, is an inflationary thing because no ones going to adopt austerity and were certainly not going to default.

And some are just hunkering down in the US and hoping for a change in the administration or something like that. As far as recourse is concerned, there's some interesting initiatives underway where there's potential litigation. As I said before, I think being unfairly deprived of your banking relationship because the industry that you're in is a violation of due process, and there may be some recourse there. Those were the lawsuits that were lodged around Trig 1.0. And I think, I certainly know there's interested firms that are trying to prepare that type of litigation. So that would be one thing. And frankly, I think Congress has a role to play in terms of their oversight. There have already been hearings pertinent to the choke point issues that we're seeing the first time around. Congress did play an important role in servicing valuable information and bringing these regulators actions into the light and placing a check on their behavior. And of course, Congress is the entity that has been, and the regulators have been sort of usurping their authority to a certain degree. So I think there should be a reaction in Congress, and thankfully in the House, we do have some folks that are really attuned to these issues and do appear to be reacting.

I think other areas of recourse are there are what, 20 million people in the United States, maybe more, that own crypto every single one of them has one member of Congress and two senators. I've worked in a congressional office before. They read the mail, they read emails, they answer the phone, they should be calling. If they care about the future of this technology and the ownership over those tokens, they should call and write their members of Congress and their senators and say it's okay and probably good to regulate crypto and protections are fine, but don't ban this technology. There are use cases for this, and I'm a proud owner and I see the potential benefits of this. And the last thing I think that gives me hope, and I think it's stronger than hope. It's some level of belief, and it's to Nick's point, that there are informed members of Congress in positions of authority that care about consumer protection, that are not just blind advocates of crypto that are working hard and cooperatively across the aisle to develop legislation that can bring some rules of the road and some clarity, and so much leading clarity to this space, because otherwise, the other piece of hope and belief that I have is that there are foreign jurisdictions, the UK is a prime example, that are much more thoughtful and well calibrated in the broader messaging of the entire government than what we're seeing here. And that while they're still working through some of the issues, they are proposing frameworks that appear to be very thoughtful. Their language is very thoughtful, it's very well calibrated. It describes the fact that there may be risks to this new of technology, but they are likely different, and there needs to be similar regulatory outcomes if there is similar activity that's involved, as opposed to just saying that there are same risks if that activity exists, and therefore there need to be the same rules, regardless of the consequences to the technology.

Than it is currently trading. Now, in terms of the Coinbase Wells notice, there's not a lot of detail in that Wells notice which defeats the purpose of what a wells notice is supposed to do. It's supposed to give the defendant or the respondent enough clarity to actually submit a defense of the facts to the commission in advance of being charged. So I think that the wells notice was vague enough that no one is necessarily certain as to what the SEC is viewing as securities. In that instance, they could view the tokens that were listed in the Wahi case as securities. They've already made that claim. They could view others, but there aren't futures contracts trading on those. So those aren't within the current regulatory fold, where the SEC lack of action basically constitutes an acknowledgement of the status of a product as being within the CFTC's jurisdiction and trading as a non security."

So we've now talked about this relationship that the government has to crypto, and then how some of that could play out in a geopolitical way. And I was wondering if you both just had any message that you wanted to give to essentially any entity or multiple entities in the government, whether regulators or lawmakers or both, what would that be?"

There's some hard work that needs to be done. The current approach is not sustainable, and the innovation is valuable enough and meaningful enough and is impactful enough and transformative enough that that effort's required. And it's required now."

        "text": "Yeah, mine's very simple. You know, when the executive oversteps the bounds of its authority, we are a system with checks and balances, and one check on their authority is the courts, of course, and that'll play out in time. But also, it's Congress's duty to act as a check on some of these federal regulators that are. Are clearly overstepping the bounds of their authority and acting outside the normal course of duty. And I would like to see more from Congress in investigating the actions of the federal agencies that are depriving crypto firms of their bank relationships. I think it's very straightforward that it's not their job to determine who these banks can do business with if it's a legal industry, which it is. So I look forward to seeing more from Congress."
