The purchase of property in the Bahamas. Barbara fried encouraged the use of straw donors as campaign finance laws or allegedly. And both were accused generally of either knowing or ignoring the red flags that FTX was in solvent. Was this development surprising or expected?"

I think what was in the lawsuits in bankruptcy referred to as adversary proceeding. But what was seen in the adversary proceeding was probably a bit shocking, the actual details. But I think people knew that they were pretty involved, and I think that was some of the heat they were getting post him, getting karma complain against him. Was that why is he hanging out with his parents? Weren't they involved in a lot of parts of the business? And people were saying things like that. I don't think it's that unexpected. People, I think, long knew that there were some real estate transactions where they were gifted or given some certain real estate in the Bahamas. But to see it all laid out in the complaint, or I should say in the adversary proceeding, was interesting, you know, and. Yeah."

I mean, if you come from a corporate background or were a tax lawyer, which his dad, I guess, was, you know, and is that there wasn't more, I don't know, structure to the organization. I mean, know, the dichotomy between what people thought pre petition, what John Ray has sort of said post petition. And now some of the revelations coming out about the pre petition activity. I mean, it's just kind of amazing to think about people that might have been more of a corporate background saying, like, if the business was so profitable, why were you cutting corners? And to be fair to these guys, like in the light of day sunlight of bankruptcy court, which, as people in bankruptcy say, like my parents would say, the last place you want to be as a criminal is in bankruptcy court because there's so much sunlight on everything. Everything gets scrutinized. And to be fair to people, sometimes the stuff gets overly scrutinized and they cherry pick stuff that went on, but it seems pretty damning some of the stuff, and let's see what the responses will be. It's good for the estate and it's good for creditors because I'm sure they want to see retribution in terms of recoveries. I don't think it's going to be incredibly meaningful. You know, 1020, 30, 40, $50 million. I mean, that's, I don't know, maybe two months of bankruptcy fees."

Like, if you were to kind of say, FtX will win in court, you know, for these reasons, like, which were the particular acts that you think probably will put things over the edge."

        "text": "Oh, yeah. I think almost all the stuff, though, they'll win on the merits of just the. Of the fraudulent conveyance. I mean, these are all fraudulent transfers, potentially while the debtor was insolvent, potentially while it was coming with funds. So clearly, all that money has to come back. I think that's pretty easy. The question is, like, what's it worth now and who can actually pay it back? Like, if money was given to a charity, can you actually go and get it back? Like, meaning is it there? Has it been spent kind of stuff? And, you know, you can only squeeze whatever rock so hard. The question will be, what is the real estate in the Bahamas worth? The $10 million or whatever that was gifted to them? Where did that money end up going? Can they trace it? So these things cost money. And then to do. And then the question is, like, how much of an effort do you want to make? And of course, all that can be stopped by a criminal investigation, which there isn't a complaint. But clearly, some of the activity could be considered criminal. And I think I won't pretend to be a criminal lawyer or a lawyer at all when you're bringing lawsuits. I mean, basically, these are kind of like, preponderance of evidence standards versus, like, you know, higher standards that you might have for criminal complaints. So it's easier for John Ray to, like, stitch together some stuff they know and slap an ap and sue these guys, but it's a little harder for the criminal side. But all of it just basically. I mean, of course, as my lawyer likes to tell me, like, you know, facts matter, Thomas, as more discovery happens and they take discovery, we'll see. But on the face of it, I mean, it looks pretty obvious that it's sort of slam dunk. There's a question as what they'll actually be able to recover."

And it was when they purchased the Bahamas property and everything was just getting billed or allegedly in the complaint to FTX, and the parents didn't even make an attempt to pay to furnish their home themselves. And I could just imagine if something similar was happening with my mother, she would be like, wait, is this okay? That we're doing this. Like, you know, she would have so many questions about the money and, like, what was okay, what was kosher, what was not. Like, I could just practically hear her in my head. But at least, you know, from what the complaint described, it didn't have feel at all like the parents had any of those qualms. So that was."

Like, someone would have said something. Maybe they thought it was a drop in the ocean. But if FDX was so wildly profitable and Alameda was so wildly profitable, they didn't need to cut in corners and have them picking up the checks. I mean, it would have been easy to. For Sam to just be like, no, I'm picking this up personally or something."

You know, like, if you were trying to criminally try them, you'd have to, like, really show that they knew, because they're gonna say they didn't know. They didn't know. Right. But the standard for, like, breach of fiduciary duty or, you know, kind of unjust enrichment, it's a much lower standard. All you have to basically show is a reasonable person should have known, you know?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Respectfully say that. I'm not a lawyer, but a stressed investor. And what people usually say is what it's. The standard is usually what a reasonable person should have known, steps a reasonable person should have taken, best practices that a board should have taken. So, like a board of director, if somebody. Somebody runs off with money in a company, they don't have to necessarily show that they knew the person stole the money, but they, did they take any steps a reasonable person would have taken to, like, verify that the money was there or that the person wasn't absconding with money or whatever. So it's this reasonable person standard that I think you trigger under Delaware and a lot of jurisdictions for breach of fiduciary duty or breach of loyalty, duty of care that you have mainly in the boardroom, but also, I think, as a C suite executive. And it sounds like he was sort of melding between the two."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. So basically, yeah, they're just trying to meet that standard, but for their purposes, they don't need to go beyond. And Barbara fried, you know, also. So as far as I understand from reading this, you know, Sam Bankman was definitely involved more in the day to day. You know, he was often listed with FTX management. He could make executive decisions on his own, at one point saying, oh, I'm just going to make this decision without Sam. We don't need to involve him, that kind of thing. So Barbara Fried was not involved at that level. However, it did say that she was a key influence on the campaign donations. And I wondered what your takeaway was in that regard in terms of her involvement there."

Again, I don't have too much to say other than it's just, it's just bizarre that, you know, so many corners were cut in regards to stuff I don't have a real view on. Again, it's like it helps them build a story that they can, you know, just slam dunk, take back any money that was taken out of the estate at any point in the last couple years by Barbara and the husband.

So you kind of alluded to this earlier, and it's simply where your mind goes when you read the complaint, but it sounds like this is leading to a criminal case. Do you agree that that is so, and if so, when do you think we might see that, et cetera?"

        "text": "You know, of course I don't focus on criminal stuff. I mean, I'm mainly focused on bankruptcy court stuff. Clearly, when you read it, it rises to the level with something that could be criminal. I mean, when people see this stuff, I mean, even take the complaint against Sam in the freezing of the Robinhood shares, which I guess were recently sold, I guess it's some news that was reported, I guess, two weeks ago. I mean, it's not actually such a great thing that they get criminally indicted or get a criminal complaint against them because it stops the lawsuit against them. And it also will deplete the assets that the state will be able to get because basically they'll be fighting criminal trial until the civil five is tried. Any money they've got, they can fight, they can use to defend themselves from the criminal. Okay, so it's clearly something they're looking into. But as you can see, as they're going down, the rung of FTX insiders, I think, you know, his mom and dad are probably a little lower in the totem pole than the people they've been going after, but it's clearly something where they could face something. But these things take many, many years. I mean, I think for criminal indictments, I mean, they can be years years after the activity. So the civil again is faster, the bankruptcy is a lot faster, but that could be, you know, coming down the pike yeah, for sure."

I don't know if they're literally record breaking, but they were extremely fast. So many people comment on, commented on that at the time last year. One thing that I wanted to ask you about also was the parents released a statement to Coindesk after this news of the lawsuit saying, quote, this is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins. And I wondered what your thoughts were on that statement."

But for the most part, and I'm sure they work, they pass information, but generally speaking, like the DOJ, it's sort of a one way street. They request information on you, you give it to them. They don't really tell you what they're doing. And so I don't think John is in any way any sort of coordinated effort. I just think he's really focused on creditors, creditor recoveries, and prosecuting the file of going through all these things. And he's got a bunch of stuff teed up. You've seen a few other adversary proceedings that have been filed, and he's going picking them off one by one and sort of working the file, adjudicating the file, and just doing what he's supposed to be doing. So I really did think the timing is maybe to them it feels like it's coordinated, but I guarantee you it's not."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And so earlier, when you were saying that the amounts that could be obtained by suing the parents are small compared to the around $8 billion that are owed to the creditors, what does that say to you that this is where they're at right now? Does it say to you that they're kind of near the end of, of trying to get money back from people or like. Yeah. What is the significance of that all."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "The lawsuits we've seen are really fraudulent transfer lawsuits or fraudulent conveyance lawsuits. And I'll use the term because everybody uses it, but I hate it. Like within clawbacks, within bankruptcy, you have fraudulent transfers and you have preferences. They haven't started any real preferences. They've only filed fraudulent transfers, basically deals that were unfavorable to the estate. Now maybe there's some other insiders, but most of those insiders have claims and those lawsuits will really be about objecting to their claims as insiders with unjust enrichments or something like that. Those are probably dealt with the claim objections. So right now he's getting, he put, he, they filed on July 31. I did the date for you. They filed the draft plan, which they're trying to get done by next July 31, 2024. So that's where he's really headed is the plan. And as part of that, he's filed all the lawsuits he wants to file for fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfers. So basically bad deals that the estate did or somebody that took advantage of the estate or something that Sam did that was sort of like an insider deal then. And they're going, you are, you're right, they're kind of getting lower and lower down, but they haven't even really started if they're going to bring any sort of preferential payment stuff. And this is a hot topic, a lot of retail investors, I'm sure, worried about it, but there are also a lot of large creditor counterparties. I will not name names, but you know them like all the big firms in crypto that would have traded with FTX are going to have some preference exposure. And the question is going to be, that'll be the big next probably shoes to drop. Are those lawsuits, how are they going to be handled? Are they going to be settled early? Are they going to offset their claims? I mean, John, I think, has said publicly, and he definitely said to me that he really wants to shrink the denominator to improve recoveries. And I think he was referring to stuff like that. I think under the bankruptcy code he has to consider going after preferences. But I think as a starting matter, those will probably be the next set of a big lawsuit. So yes, the short answer to your question, yes, I think he's going down the rung of interesting fraudulent transfer cases to bring."

        "text": "Okay. Yeah. And this lawsuit against the parents did also prompt Stanford University to say that it would return money that was donated to them. You know, the way that came up in the suit was that the suit alleged, quote, Benkman was involved in these donations that did not benefit the FTX group and instead amounted to naked self dealing by Bankman, who sought to curry favor with and enrich his employer at the FTX group's expense. You know, that that was an additional amount of money that they were able to get. But you're right. It's not. It's not a large amount."

It's not like these people are bad, but just weird back of the envelope, like, sure, here's $10 million. Yeah, sure, here's a million bucks type of transactions with no papering, no contract. You have to question, like, why did Sam do that? Like, I don't know that it was to. I mean, whatever. We can't get into the psychology of his head and what he was thinking, but it's some very bizarre stuff. I mean, employees with bonuses that were never. They never had contracts. The bonuses were in crypto. There's no record of the bonus other than, like, a whatever, a slack message or a telegram message, just bizarre stuff that you would not normally see anyway."

But just to go into it, and I saw that before I came on, that Balaji had tweeted about clawbacks or preferences, which is pretty funny. It's made it all the way up the pole of biology. But the idea of Balgi screening Boston. Yeah, yeah, sorry. For the record, are there multiple biologies?"

So, on preferences, there's really no distinction between a preference that belongs to a business or an individual. Of course, it sort of tugs at the heartstrings a bit more. If it's an individual who was just trading their account, they were just moving money around the way you would in your brokerage account or your bank account. You think, well, hang on, wait. I got to pay that money back. I was lucky to get a little bit off. What do you mean, I got to pay it back? There's that. That comes into it when it's a retail person, probably more so than once an institution, generally speaking, clawbacks or preferences in a 546 section of bankruptcy code. That's important. The idea is within 90 days of bankruptcy you received a payment that was preferential in nature. Even if you didn't know it. You don't have to have knowledge because the idea is you got a payment that was preferential. And so the other creditors are out because you took money out. And so they're getting less because you basically took money out of a tub that wasn't full. And so it's presumed that there was insolvent. And so you have some, of course, defenses to preferences and we can walk through those. But of course most people are very scared, I think on the retail side of preferences. I think there are a lot of good defenses to preferences and again, we can walk through them. But the estate did come out recently and say that they were kind of showing what the preference exposure looked like to their exposure, but their potential preferences they could go after. And it looks pretty ugly because a few things, one, they showed that there was like $9 billion in the last 15 days. There isn't a lot of case law."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It was moved from the exchange before the petition date. And there isn't a lot of case law on banks filing for bankruptcy because they can, since 1986. I think it might have been earlier, but 1986 onward, they could not file for bankruptcy. There's a lot of case law. There is some case law before 1986 and there's some subsequent 1986 about extraordinary periods where you can't argue what's called ordinary course defense. And this is a big defense that a lot of people use in traditional bankruptcy and in the crypto bankruptcies around preferential payments that could be potentially clawed back. And I think creditors will make that. I think the terms of service are not going to stand up, but people will still try to argue that. And there are some other defenses if you want to go into them. But basically the idea is if 9 billion went off the platform, that 9 billion could be clawed back lawsuit by lawsuit by lawsuit, and you would have to pay that money in, before your other claim. The remainder of your claim that you have in the estate would be allowed and they have the power of offset. So let's say you have a million dollar claim and you took off a million dollars in the preference period. They could literally offset your claim with the preference. So it's kind of, you know, on one level you think, oh, this is great, it's gonna help recoveries, but it's kind of a bloody way to get there. But this is effectively what happened in Madoff and happens in all the big bankruptcies, which is they do look at clawbacks, the better your defense is. Ordinary course of business is probably the leading defense. New value defense, meaning I deposited after I withdrew money. Let's see if we can keep going. Ordinary course, new value. And yeah, those are the big ones. There might be one more, but then the other one that people are talking about is the safe harbor, which allows for, oh, gosh, I don't want to go into this. Transactions between financial intermediaries cannot be clawed back under. Thing called 546 e, the bankruptcy code. This is put in during the 2005 updates to the bankruptcy code. And the idea is you don't want financial contagion. And so the way you prevent financial contagion is transactions between financial intermediaries cannot be sort of clawed back. Right. So, like, if you get a financial crisis like 2008 or bank run, you don't really want other banks having to pay other banks back if they all go under because it just creates contagion. What happens is everybody tries to suck money out of the system because they're worried about preferences. And I actually think it's important for the crypto ecosystem to probably argue for 546 treatment, but no one's taking me up on that."

Generally, it's like if Fidelity's trading with, with t row price or things like that. So when you have all these Wall street brokerage firms, but it also applies to, it says financial intermediary is what the code says. And of course this has been like super heavily litigated, like all the way up to the Supreme Court a few times or many times, what the definition of financial intermediary is and stuff like this. It's a very highly technical thing, but it is a potential defense. And we'll see how John and the guys at FTX go about arguing it. I think the judge, I mean, people forget that the judge is going to be very sympathetic to the idea that if there was a bank run in the last 15 days, the people got to pay that money back. Now he might let it say, okay, ordinary course defense applies to everything in October or, you know, whatever the other, the other 60, 70 days. But in those last ten or 15 days when there was a huge bank run, I'm not allowing you to argue ordinary course defense, but now that defense is out, but now you have to argue new value. Well, people were just pulling money out, so new value isn't going to apply to a lot of those, a lot of those withdraws because the deposits already happened. There's not going to be a deposit sub completely with withdrawals. So then you're left with 546 e, which is a very expensive proposition to be arguing. So it could meaningfully help recoveries, but it's also going to come off the pound of flesh of other creditors."

So in order to do that, they have to claw back the funds, create one big pool again, and then cut them all by the same percentage before paying everybody out. So, you know, honestly, it's not that different from what never did this. Well, Mount Gogs didn't, but Bitfinex did something similar."

But what they did was they introduced that token, which I think basically there were some different options on, like whether or not you took the token or you took cash, or you could trade the token or you could just hold onto it and like hope that the value of the token would eventually rise. And I think it was based on something like the revenues of the exchange. And so then eventually, at a certain point when the revenues had come in enough, the exchange actually was able to buy everybody out who had any of those tokens left. So it doesn't sound like the state is going to do anything like that, but they will. Sounds like, or at least they're considering doing the socializing of the losses."

Someone wants to buy a claim and fight my preference or just be ready to fight it. But if it's like, hey, we're not in the business of fighting this stuff. And once the market hears about this, it's not going to help our brand equity, then you're going to want to deal with it. And if you're a smaller retail trader, you probably even, you don't have better odds because you need to hire a real counsel. If it's like a million dollar plus preference, but it's a smaller preference, it's hard for them to bring cases and actually collect. So what does it someone say, like, possession is nine tenths of the law? I mean, it's kind of a joke, but also, like, it's hard for them to collect a $200,000 preference from a retail client. So I don't want to get people spooked if they're a small retail client, even like someone with like a $20,000 preference. I mean, imagine how hard it is for the apparatus of John and, you know, 2000 hours, $2,000 an hour, lawyers to collect something like that. Just very hard."

        "text": "The description hello, and thanks for tuning into this week's unchained weekly news recap. This is Michael del Castillo, a Knight bagehot fellow at Columbia University. This week, federal magistrate judge Zia Farouki denied the US securities and Exchange Commission's request to inspect Binance US software, urging the regulatory body to narrow its demands for additional information. The SEC has been keen to scrutinize Binance US's relationship with crypto custodian Cephu, which, according to its own site, rebranded from Binance custody in February and is, quote, the only institutional custody partner of the Binance exchange, according to a statement from the company. Cephu takes its name from Binance's secure asset fund for users, or Safu. Safu, an emergency insurance fund that Coindesk last year reported had $700 million worth of BNB in one account, now holding only $286 million worth of BNB and $300 million worth of bitcoin in another account now holding $430 million worth of bitcoin, while the assets remain in the accounts previously associated with Binance's insurance fund. A month after Cephu was rebranded, Binance released a statement saying it would start using two different stablecoins. This is all to say that the SEC now has come to suspect that Binance us and Cefu might not be quite as separate as sefus press release sought to make it appear, accusing the custodian of facilitating the movement of us customer funds abroad, Binance CEO Changpenge CZ Zhao denied the SEC's claims that Binance US used Cefu for handling customer assets. In a social media post, he wrote, quote, Binance us does not use and has never used Cephu or Binance custody. You can't just make this stuff up. That said, the judge has encouraged both parties to cooperate and try to find a middle ground to move the case forward. In a recent development that signals heightened scrutiny of the crypto industry, the head of the SEC's crypto assets and cyber unit, David Hirsch, announced that the agency is intensifying its focus on businesses operating similarly to industry giants like Coinbase and Binance. During Hirsch's address at a day long event in Chicago for both current and former SEC employees, he emphasized that the regulatory body is not limiting its investigations to prominent exchanges, but is extending its probes into intermediaries and decentralized finance products. Despite facing recent legal setbacks, including the previously mentioned denied request to access Binance US software and challenges in cases related to crypto investment firms, the SEC remains steadfast in its mission, Hirsch affirmed, quote, we're going to continue to bring those charges, end quote, he said, indicating what appears to be the continuation of a steadfast approach to monitoring firms that potentially violate federal securities laws. However, Hirsch also acknowledged constraints on the agency, including its limited enforcement budget, which could hamper additional investigations against well funded exchanges embroiled in complex federal legal battles. In this week's episode of the chopping block, Zero X Labs founder Will Warren talked about the challenges smaller startups face in dealing with a lawsuit. With legal fees amounting to large percentages of their capital raised. It remains to be seen whether small DeFi projects will be able to survive the us regulatory onslaught, making matters potentially much worse for those in the crypto industry. Should any of these lightly funded startups lose their legal battles, it could set precedents that impact the rest of the industry. Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, US Senator Elizabeth Warren a member of the Democratic Party, gained robust support for her digital asset Anti Money Laundering Act, a legislative effort initiated in July 2023 to curb illicit activities facilitated by cryptocurrencies. The bill, backed by a growing coalition of ten senators, all Democrats or caucused with the Democratic Party, aims to tighten regulatory loopholes and impose stringent know your customer and anti money laundering requirements on many participants in the crypto sector, including wallet providers and miners. In a statement, Warren emphasized the urgency to halt criminal enterprises exploiting the digital asset ecosystem. In related news, New York's historically influential financial regulator, the same one behind the controversial bitlicense, proposed stricter guidelines for cryptocurrency listings, focusing on technology, market and regulatory risk assessments. Contrary to tethers previous claim that it would halt secured loans by the end of this year, the stablecoin issuer has continued to issue USDT denominated loans to its clients. The Wall Street Journal reports Tether's latest quarterly financial update revealed a loan portfolio of $5.5 billion as of June 30. That's actually an increase from the $5.3 billion in the previous quarter. Tether spokesperson Alex Welsh in fact confirmed the new loans, stating they were issued to, quote longstanding clients, end quote, to prevent liquidity depletion or unfavorable collateral sales. Welsh added that Tether now aims to end its loans by next year. Welsh went on to defend tethers actions, citing $3.3 billion in excess reserves and criticizing traditional financial institutions for not meeting crypto customer demand. The company's loan practices remain under scrutiny as its balance sheets lack transparency about which assets are being used as collateral to stabilize tethers price. Ironically, though more transparent stablecoin issuers like circle behind the USDC stablecoin continue to see the market caps of their stable assets decline. The legal skirmish between Gemini Trust and the digital currency group DCG intensified this week as Gemini vehemently opposed DCG's recent recovery proposal for Genesis global creditors. In a filing on September 15, Gemini's legal team denounced the plan as a total mirage, accusing DCG of presenting contrived, misleading and inaccurate assertions, end quote, to Genesis creditors. The proposal suggested a recovery rate of 70% to 90% for unsecured creditors. With Gemini earn users potentially seeing a 95% to 110% recovery, it'll be interesting to see how a more than 100% recovery could pan out. Gemini insists that the proposed recovery rates do not reflect the real value terms. The ongoing dispute, marked by allegations of fraud and legal entanglements, sees both companies grappling with a lawsuit filed by the SEC earlier this year. The Ethereum based decentralized exchange protocol balancer faced yet another security breach on Tuesday night and urged users to refrain from interacting with its website following an attack last month that led to $900,000 worth of losses at the time. Representatives of the platform on Tuesday tweeted a warning about a front end attack, which at the time of the tweet they wrote was still being investigated. Early reports from blockchains security firms indicate that approximately $238,000 in cryptocurrency might have been siphoned off following the previous attack. Users were advised to exercise caution as the website seemed to have suffered a redirect attack, tricking users into thinking they were using a real investor interface, when in fact they were willfully turning over their assets to the thieves. Following this attack, it looks like that warning might have been worth paying attention to. Hong Kong police intensified their investigation into the JPEGs crypto exchange, arresting six individuals, including crypto influencer Joseph Lam, alleging they misled the public regarding the exchanges licensing and other operational aspects. The crackdown reportedly follows over 1400 complaints made to local authorities and suspected involvement of assets worth approximately hk$1 billion, or about $128 million. Meanwhile, the exchange faces a liquidity crisis with halted operations and skyrocketed withdrawal fees, which jpegs attributes to malicious actions by third party market makers. Of course, it's entirely possible that these were just investors making a better bet than the exchange could or wanted to handle. Japan securities and Futures Commission, or SFC, had previously flagged JPEGs for allegedly falsely claiming it had a valid license. The exchange, asserting its commitment to continue operations, is actively negotiating with market makers to resolve the cash flow shortage in the face of plummeting bitcoin NFT sales and a broader asset class downturn. The creator of the bitcoin Ordinals protocol, Casey Rodemore, is advocating for a revamp of the current inscription numbering system that lets users draw or inscribe images and other data directly into the bitcoin blockchain. In a post on the GitHub repository that houses the ordinals codebase, the software engineer argued that the existing method has led to complex code and hindered progress. Initially, the numbering was designed to remain stable, meaning inscriptions would retain their original numbers forever. However, maintaining this stability has proven to be a significant challenge, especially with alterations to the inscryption protocol. The current system assigns negative numbers to unrecognized inscriptions, creating what Rotomore calls cursed inscriptions that fail to indicate the order of creation and adding complexity and bugs to the system. Rodemore proposes integrating these cursed numbers into the main sequence and eliminating their use in URL's. This adjustment, he notes, would result in what he says are minimal changes, with new numbers differing from about by about 1% from the old ones. When ordinals first launched this January, they were controversial for potentially bogging down bitcoin transaction volumes by creating traffic that some viewed as being not fundamental to bitcoin's core value proposition, while others saw them as a crucial step to remaining competitive against the likes of Ethereum, which started to popularize NFTs as far back as 2015. Those concerns have waned of late, with ordinals volume down 97% between May and August, according to a DAP radar report. As always, there's plenty going on in Defi and Daos. Here's a quick roundup over 70% of Apecoin DAo members backed proposal AIP 297, co authored by Animoco brand's chairman Yat Sudhie, to create a sisterdao and NFT community treasury for influential NFT acquisitions layer one blockchain network Kanto said it plans to transition to an Ethereum layer two, utilizing the polygon chain development kit for a network emphasizing the integration of real world assets. The creators of layer two network optimism announced a $26 million airdrop distributing 19 tokens to 31,870 addresses as part of their engagement and reward strategy. After much deliberation, the founder of F two Pool, a crypto mining operating business, decided to refund 19.8 bitcoin to blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos after the firm inadvertently paid a whopping $520,000 fee on a relatively tiny $2,000 transaction. Mark Cuban, the american billionaire investor, reportedly lost $870,000 in a DeFi related scam. Looking for something more fun? Genesis is rebranding. You may wonder why. To what? Take a closer listen to stand up comedian Ginny Hogan's take on the whole matter."

        "text": "Huge news. Genesis is changing its name to Exodus, or at least its mission. Last week, the company announced its plan to sunset, a term definitely created by a person who has never looked at a sunset all its trading services worldwide. The sun comes back a few hours later. Spokesperson said that this decision was made voluntarily, which is very good because I cannot support non consensual sunsets. Genesis filed chapter eleven bankruptcy earlier this year, but at the time they thought that their parent company, DCG, would bail them out. But no, daddy's out of cash, too. This is literally the plot of Schitt's creek. Good news is that Genesis has assured users that they'll be made nearly whole. The bad news is that they haven't specified what that means. Genesis owes its creditors nearly $3.5 billion. Some, such as the Winklevoss twins of Gemini, say that that is wholly insufficient. Okay, Winklevi, here's the rock. Use your strong rowing arms to squeeze some water out of it. For any Genesis users out there, you have until Wednesday to finish up your trades. 48 hours is an eternity in crypto. There's still plenty of time to lose thousands of dollars."
