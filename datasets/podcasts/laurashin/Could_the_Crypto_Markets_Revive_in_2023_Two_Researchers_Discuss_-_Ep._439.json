        "text": "Yeah, I think with the collapse of FTX, we've seen a bit of a reckoning, especially in deFi projects that were supported by FTX. I think in 2023 we're going to see a lot more search for product market fits. I think FTX was really centered around the speculative use case of crypto assets, where it predominantly served as a speculation platform. They did fund a lot of really interesting projects in the space, but at the same time, the majority of their focus was really the speculative use case. I think given the scale of the collapse of FTX, we're going to see really a reshift in priorities and potentially a focus on use cases that really add value and potentially abstract away even the notion that there's a blockchain in the background. I think the product market fits of projects is going to get tested, especially if markets continue to contract. We might finally see projects that have product market fit to survive because they're providing services that are valuable."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, so I agree with Lucas. A couple of things I would add on top of that. So with the collapse of FTX and three arrows and a bunch of other projects, we've also seen a pretty large collapse in terms of credit in the market, which generally just translates to less liquidity because market makers have less available cash to market make with. On top of that, we also see significantly less retail in the market, which kind of removes the other side of a lot of the trades. So that also translates into slightly less liquidity. So I think that will continue in 2023. And just overall, exactly like Lucas said, there's going to be flights to actual quality and there's not going to be as much speculation. I think the macro markets will continue kind of dictating how crypto markets overall recover and how they turn out in 2023. Just overall, it's going to be slightly slower and quieter than we saw in 2022. That would be kind of my guess. And there's going to be a lot of impact from 2022, mainly because people are going to be scared. They're going to be constantly looking for as skeptical as you can be. We already see that now. Everyone's second guessing everything, and I think that's going to continue being a trend."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. Yeah. And I would say that part of that also is simply because the public perception of crypto has really taken a beating. So when you talk about how there's not that much retail, I don't know how soon they're going to come back. But one thing I wanted to ask just to draw on your comments a little bit more, is I saw that Coinmetrics published this chart of the crypto prices in 2022. I'm sure everybody saw this because this was a very sobering chart with fire engine reduced colors for how the prices have gone. Something that was fascinating to me was that some of the coins that fared better were ones that arent even thought of as very good, like Tron Ripple, BSV, and ethereum classic, which is kind of funny. But anyway, so I was just curious, do you feel that the prices are going to draw down even further in 2023, or are we going to see some uptick somewhere? Orlando, what's your take?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, this was a year, or 2022 was a year of pain, right? There was a lot of projects that just collapsed, effectively became zombie projects with no one really backing them. And what you saw with projects that were able to retain some momentum were the communities behind these projects that at times are not the healthiest. But the fact that there are communities behind these projects certainly helps on the market side. If you have a market that's predominantly retail for some of these assets that are deemed, you know, not of particularly high quality, but you have a strong retail community that can also be incredibly powerful. There's only so much that that will get you, though. There's, you know, at some point that project needs to deliver or it needs to continue to pump in order for this cohort of retail investors to continue to support it. And we saw this in the aftermath of the 2017 bull market as well. A lot of projects that had huge communities, Iota, XRP, they weren't immune to the continuation of the bear market. And the same might be happening here where you have a little bit of a lag. But retail users are quite price responsive. So if we continue to see a decrease, those projects will follow suit as well. The ones that were able to survive, I think they're still hanging on to that belief that the prices will continue to pump, which what we're seeing in the global macro situation, it's probably not going to be the case."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "One more thing I'll add to that, and I totally agree with Lucas, is that there's also the effect of just projects that have unlocks where investors bought a lot of coins for cheap with a lot of the projects that you named, XRP, BSV, even bitcoin, Ethereum, it just doesn't exist. But then you look at something like Solana or some of these other coins and VC's bought ads still at this point, it has gone down 95%, but they still bought at prices that are still like 80% lower. These dynamics do a lot in a bear market, in a bull market, it almost became a meme where there's an unlock, the price will actually go up in this market long term. It actually isn't that way because some investors are very much in the red, and if they bought tokens for cheap, those tokens will be sold. And when you look at on chain stuff, which I'm sure Lucas is tracking as well, you see a ton of selling, even at these really low prices by investors. And some of it is forced selling because they're just down a lot and they don't want to disappoint anymore. So these unlocks actually are quite bearish in a market like this. And I think that will continue being the case. We've seen a ton of ton of vc investment in 2022, and some of these prices are still much higher than some of these investors bought them. And so I think that will continue being a trend as well. It will become much more popular for diligent investors to track unlocks much closer in 2023, for sure."

        "text": "Yeah. And not to pile on with the negative news, but in addition to that, we still have kind of continuing fallout and contagion. Obviously, we had the first set of collapses, but then now because of FTX, there is this cloud on the horizon with the genesis DCG Gemini earn situation. By extension, even grayscale potentially could be a problem here. So what do you guys think might happen there, and how do you think that will also affect both the industry and the market?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, contagion is not something that happens immediately. Right. It certainly did for a lot of projects in the aftermath of the collapse of FTX, projects that didn't really have that much Runway or that even from a public perception, because they're a part of what's now considered a massive scam, they were unable to survive. But a lot of these larger institutions, they're able to move capital around and obtain short term liquidity at times at very unfavorable terms. So there's always that danger that in the short term they can remain afloat and suppress any sort of concerns around their solvency. But people are skirmish and afraid because if those conditions are not favorable to the point where they're just pushing the problem further down the line. You have these cascading failures, and I think it's highly likely that we haven't seen the full extent of contagion. It's been only a couple of months now, not even a couple of months. I should say that the collapse of FTX feels like three years. It feels like four years. It's been only a few days. So it's something that will likely haunt us a little bit. Still, in 2023, I think we're going to have a couple of additional companies that were able to obtain short term liquidity and survive push the issue further down the line. But if those conditions are also market dependent and the markets continue to contract, the contagion will also lead to their demise as well. One quarter is really nothing when it comes to the scale of fraud. So it will likely be a recurring topic in 2023."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. What I'll add is that contingent really works in funny ways. Like we saw with Terra, Terra then translated into three arrows, having issues and then going down completely, obviously, combined with GBTC, but regardless. And then after that, it took another five months for FTX to go down whilst having issues with both of these. And when you look at Genesis, I mean, Genesis is quite similar. I mean, obviously I don't think that there's fraud there, but they have been exposed to effectively every single collapse that we saw in 2022. It was terra exposure. It was exposure to three arrows. There was some blockfi deals as well. And then I think finally the FTX as well. So there has been just so much beating that Genesis has taken, and obviously there isn't much concrete information. But I mean, it's pretty much understood that there are at least one, maybe even 2 billion in a hull right now. And it kind of remains to be seen how that will be solved and what effect that will have on its parent organization and other companies in that parent organization."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So, yeah, I mean, it's just a really difficult time to be struggling because everyone else is struggling and it's really difficult to raise capital. That's the entire story of the end of 2022, is that the projects, they're having issues, regardless of how well they're structured and how well their business looks. It's really, really hard to actually get any capital. And I think that's exactly what DCG and genesis are running into right now. So it's difficult to make predictions. They could find capital somewhere, but I think if they don't, it could definitely be a pretty significant issue, because Genesis and grayscale are massively important. And grayscale, as we know, two products, GBTC and ethe, they're both trading at roughly 50% discounts right now. And it's because everyone is scared of what could happen if this actually ends up materializing. And it is somewhat of a possibility that those funds would have to be liquidated if someone else, for example, bought these assets and they wanted to go in that direction. Whereas if it's just grayscale and their barry isn't really interested in liquidating any of the funds because they're just generating a lot of money, there's less certainty there. So I think we'll end up seeing. But it's definitely scary, and it's definitely worth keeping really close. I own."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I was just going to say that I think valuations will have to come down, too, if it is in fact, a very tough environment to raise capital and even perpetuate their business model. A lot of their business models rely on folks trading demand for lending. And with markets contracting, so does the revenues. So if they have to basically raise funds on the basis of equity, very likely that valuations will have to come down quite considerably in 2023 as a result of their short term liquidity crunch."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, and I will just say I think that's already happening. And one good example of that is when you look at coinvest stock, I mean, it's trading at less than $8 billion market cap, and in the bear market 2018, which in my opinion, was actually worse in a lot of ways because people thought crypto would die, they raised at 8 billion. So it's currently less than the investors paid in 2018 bear market. And that's on the second after the direct listing, when it's trading on the market. So I think valuations have already contracted insanely. It's just not as visible yet, but I think this year it will become visible quite a lot more."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So it's interesting that you said that you felt that the 2018 bear market was actually worse, because people have been noticing that in previous bearish cycles, the prices would draw down, but they wouldn't ever really go below the high of the previous cycle, the previous bubble. And in this cycle, they have gone. Well, at least for bitcoin, it's gone below the high of the 2017 2018 cycle. So I was curious why you thought that was, and kind of what you thought that meant for this bear market?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I think just to clarify, I think in some ways it's better, in some ways it's worse. I think where it's actually better is that there are now it's kind of common thinking that crypto will be back, that it will continue coming back, and that prices will eventually rebound in 2018. I remember basically I started working at the block late 2018. I was thinking in two years I might not have a job because this thing just might not turn out. And this year I'm just not seeing that as much. But it's also worse in a lot of ways. We didn't see as many collapses as we did in 2022. 2018. It was just slow bleeding into nothing and projects dying because they ran out of money. Whereas in 2022 we just saw absolute, these projects get absolutely destroyed, dropped to actual zero, which previously was a meme. It can't go to zero. But a lot of these projects actually did go to zero. I think those are the two aspects that I would compare to, but in a lot of ways the industry is much larger. And to answer your question, why did prices actually go lower? I think a reasonable response would be that the macro environment is actually significantly worse than it was 2018. 2018 was kind of isolated, in my opinion, to the crypto bull and bear cycles, whereas now you have Tesla going down 80% as well. You have other stocks that are very speculatory going down as well. And that's because there's just significantly less capital and because of what central banks are doing with the interest rates. Thats really challenging. When you combine the bear market of the normal cycles in crypto plus also the macro bear market, I think prices could actually go a lot lower despite what people think, but they might also not. Its just really difficult to read in a market like this."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I would add that crypto very much trades like an industry. If you think about it as an industry, as a highly speculative tech stock, we havent seen a recession coinciding with crypto existing. We also haven't seen a period of monetary tightening when crypto existed. So it is very difficult to make predictions and look retrospectively in terms of understanding what would be the market dynamics, because a lot of the investments that came into this space were really coming from traditional funds. There's certainly a retail mania as well. In credit tightening, capital is not as fluid and it becomes a lot harder for this scale of investments to really take place. That's why I think there's going to be this reckoning of what is this technology actually doing and what problems is it solving? Because these investors are going to have to be very careful deploying into projects that are even pre launch, as in 2017. I saw in 2017 were really just based on an idea, a white paper, not a whole lot of actually organic users and actual software written. In a lot of ways, though, this is a lot more of an optimistic time for the industry relative to 2018. I think in terms of use cases, there are clearly a lot more use cases for this technology now that coincide with more of a thirst for better services, less surveillance, perhaps in some of these apps. Freedom of speech is a huge topic in today's discourse and ownership of data. So I think there are a lot of interesting use cases that have been somewhat validated, maybe not to their full extent, but there are various areas now that really just didn't exist in 2018, maybe were created because of this influx of capital. But if one of them goes well, which there's high likelihood that one of these areas that this industry we call crypto is pursuing will actually provide value, I think the industry itself will be uplifted. We just haven't really seen that yet. And because it's coinciding with a pretty damning collapse in terms of traditional finance and credit tightening, it is something that is concerning, but there are reasons to be optimistic as well."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, so we've touched on crypto venture investing at a few different points in this discussion, and I would say the industry is probably having its own sort of reckoning right now. And yet it's also just kind of at this interesting place because VC's have raised 70% of all the funding they've ever raised in the last two years alone. Portfolio performance maybe hasn't been so great, but given how much cash they have at the moment. I was curious where you thought crypto VC would go in 2023."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I can opine here quickly. I think you're totally right. There's still a lot of cash on the sidelines from these investors. What we've seen, and we track all these deals as well internally, is that capital hasn't been allocated over the last three to six months as much as it was before, despite there being a lot of capital on the sidelines. But also a lot of these funds, as you guys know, they have a mandate to invest. Some of them are long only funds, and some of them cannot justify having a few billions of dollars on the sidelines not doing anything. So I do think that they will eventually have to be allocated, but there is significantly higher standards, kind of as Lucas mentioned, the valuations have tanked massively. I mean, from what I've seen privately as well as kind of just from the publicly announced deals, really, most companies are raising right now are raising because they're in distress situations, because they're running out of money and because they in some way like have to raise or they're just going to have to close the project. And the valuations of like seed investments as well as series a have tanked. In my kind of experience, at least 60%. Like six months ago, we saw valuations for seed investments going from anywhere like $6,000, $200 million, and now theyre lucky. Theyre getting 15 to 20 just like before. So I think thats playing a large effect as well. But on the other hand, these funds eventually will have to allocate their capital. And I think theres just going to be more focus for quality and for projects that are more long term oriented and maybe not as focused on speculation. That would be my quick opinion."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I completely agree. I think for some VC's, this is the perfect environment because especially for the companies that need short term liquidity, those that raised in 2020, 2021, and even some that have raised earlier this year, before the market saw the second wave of failures and contractions, it is the perfect environment because they have the dry powder. There are companies that need capital and that are taking these valuation hits. So it's something that to them could be very positive. I think the nature of what they're doing, though, has probably changed quite a bit, especially when it comes to due diligence. I think what folks have realized post FTX collapses the level of due diligence that some of these VC's were doing in their companies that they're investing in, the individuals that they were backing, was really lackluster. So our analysis at Coinmetrics has shown some pretty crazy smoking guns around FTX and their activities that were just not really understood or acknowledged by a lot of these VC's. I don't think they were scrutinizing a lot of these projects to their full extent. So in a lot of ways, this is a positive for the industry as well, because there's pressure for them not only to take these deals for companies that are in distress, that need short term liquidity, but it also enables them to or pushes them to do more due diligence on their investments and potentially prevent scams of this magnitude from growing, because now we probably learned a pretty painful lesson in the need for due diligence. So in a lot of ways, this is a very favorable environment for VC investing. But it has changed in terms of the nature of the work that entails making investment into a crypto company."

        "text": "At the moment, another part of the industry that is just kind of a source of mostly bad news is bitcoin mining. Bitcoin miners as an industry are about $4 billion in debt, and a number of them, including large ones like core scientific, filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy. And also, obviously, with the price of bitcoin in the doldrums, mining is actually unprofitable for many or most of them. So what do you guys expect to happen amongst bitcoin miners in 2023?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I think there's going to be a massive collapse in hash rates that's just waiting to take place. A lot of the ASICs that are alive right now mining bitcoin, they were financed through debt, and because of the contraction, the price of bitcoin, a lot of these operations are just not profitable, but they are forced to continue to mine because they need to get something out of their existing hardware they cannot afford not to mine. There's a lot of speculation as to why hash rate was continuing to go up when the price of bitcoin had collapse quite drastically. And that's essentially the reason, right? They do not own the machines that they. They're using to mine bitcoin. A lot of them finance these machines, and those machines sometimes are even used as collateral. So as the market conditions worsen, their profitability goes down. Electricity prices have also been fluctuating quite a lot. It's not as bad as it once was, but they had to take a hit from increases in electricity prices, coinciding with a very negative environment for bitcoin. Ultimately, I think we're going to see a continuation and a decrease in hash rates, and we'll see a lot of markets for asics, like secondary markets for asics, but likely to extend this, the pain, really, I don't think that this decrease in hashrate will be a cause of concern from a security perspective, all of the evidence that we've seen is that bitcoin drastically overpays for its security in terms of potential attack vectors. But it is not something that is positive news, really. There's no twist around why this is potentially good. I think it is going to be a painful environment for miners heading into next year as a result of this collapse, not only in the price of bitcoin, hashrate going down, and also the value of these Asics that were at times paid over. MSRP also collapsing as a result of this contraction in the market."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "The only thing I'll add to that, and I totally agree, is that this will really be a cleansing of the overall quality of miners out there. The companies overall, those that have, that are prepared to properly use hedges properly, actually sell and not overuse the credit that they can get, those are the ones that deserve to survive, in my opinion. And those that haven't done a good job, that have just been kind of greedy and overextended because they thought that bitcoin price would keep going up or for whatever reason, those maybe don't deserve it as much because then they end up causing issues like we've seen. And then there's a ton of companies with exposure to these. These firms, like 100%, including Genesis, I think. So these, while they're much smaller than something like FTX blowing up or any other company filing for bankruptcy, these also have effects on the space overall. And I think overall, exactly like Lucas said, hash rate will go down, but it will actually improve the quality of these operations for the next cycle. And the people who actually know what they're doing are going to be very valuable. When price goes up, it's easy to make money. When price goes down, it's actually very difficult. And those that are run the most efficiently, those are the ones that survive. So hopefully that translates into the next cycle. Hopefully. If it comes."

And then obviously when the sanctions happened right before the merge, suddenly that became a concern. And then obviously after the merge, now we're seeing 70% of blocks being censored.

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, it's probably one of the most concerning trends in terms of censorship. I think the whole structure of MEV infrastructure is concerning not only from the censorship perspective, but there are also single points of failure that were introduced as a result of this. Right? How to attack a crypto network in a 101, the biggest power that an attacker could get is the composition of a block, the transactions that are inside of that block. It is like this notion of adding transactions to a block and aggregating transactions to a block is basically what MUV is. You want to organize the transactions in a block in the most profit maximizing way at times by receiving transactions directly from traders that are extracting arbitrage profits from various different markets. This, in the context of proof of work, is done mostly by mining pools. So mining pools would aggregate the work from all their constituents that were using that mining pool, and they themselves would select the composition of the transactions in a block. It's still the case that the majority of blocks in bitcoin are selected by less than 20 entities. And it is probably one of the biggest sources of concern, at least in my view, when it comes to security. The hypothesis with Ethereum was that that structure would be improved because now you have a much broader set of validators that are acting like miners and appending the blockchain, adding new blocks to the blockchain. But in reality, there's another centralizing force behind us, right wherever you basically replaced the structure with mining pools, with their MEV counterparts and MEV infrastructure providers. So it is in a sense pretty negative, because it is something that the trend for MEV and the profitability of MEV is a lot more tempting than, say, what a mining pool operator would do to maximize their profits. With MEV, you have a lot more entities involved and that are relying on these open source, at times endpoints, but a lot of them are not open source, and that also has its own set of challenges. But decentralization forces are very powerful, especially in MEV, because centralization, the more centralized that you get, the more opportunities you have to make more money, let alone all of the potential security concerns that emerge as a result of this. There are some good news there. I think there's a lot of work in what's called proposer block separation, PBS that's being discussed right now. I do think it's something that needs to take place at the base layer. And we've had strong cohorts of users that support this idea that MEV needs to be more modular and there needs to be more safeguards so that you're basically nothing. Replacing a structure that was less than ideal with a structure that is more predatory and potentially dangerous to the entirety of the network. So bear markets tend to be positive in the sense of it's when things get billed. And I'm hopeful that PBS will be something pretty high on the priorities list within the Ethereum, researchers that are working exclusively on MeV."

        "text": "That was a really good explanation. So I don't have much to add, I will say, Laura, exactly like you said, that it was kind of unexpected for a lot of people that censoring blocks in this case, or complying with sanctions would happen this fast. I think that was definitely quite unexpected for a lot of people, given the tornado situation. Exactly as Lucas said, there are now initiatives, and flashbots is developing one of them as well, to kind of like decentralize building of the blocks itself and kind of like create a mempool, kind of a plug in mempool that would solve some decentralization issues. But I think it was not expected that this would come up as fast as it did, and therefore it is one of the largest concerns for me as well when it comes to Ethereum. It's also slightly concerning that a lot of really prominent Ethereum community members are not talking about it and they're ignoring it and saying, oh, this is going to be fine, because a year from now or two years from now, this will be fixed. I would expect, just like in bitcoin, when there is some threat, even if it's just perceived as short term to decentralization, people would speak up a lot, and people really talk about this as much as they possibly can. And that's one thing that I found quite concerning myself, is that a lot of the prominent people have just not talked about it enough and are just kind of like closing their eye to those concerns. Whereas if it's a concern with Solana or concern with anything else that that is related to centralization, they bring it up immediately. That kind of approach by the community itself is a bit concerning for making the blockchain long term as decentralized as possible. Those just be some thoughts I would add to what Lucas said, because that was great."

        "text": "Sarah, I was just going to say that I really resonate with this notion that a lot of voices in the Ethereum community, I think, need to be louder about this being in fact, a problem. I think this is how these issues get resolved. I'm optimistic that this is, in essence, a technical problem to be solved. It's not something possible. There are various solutions that have been proposed to improve the decentralization of MeV. It's interesting if you talk to me engineers that are working on this directly, it's almost like a nuclear scientist mentality. They understand they're working with plutonium and they don't want it to lead to contagion and a nuclear disaster. I think there's awareness of their responsibility. A lot of these folks might not talk as publicly as others, but it is something that I've seen a lot of really interesting, even papers that are published openly about fair transaction sequencing block composability. In terms of MEV, it is something that needs to be discussed, because in a period where you see decreases in interest, especially from retail, in DeFi and DeFi protocols, MEV opportunities also decrease. And what that might ultimately lead to is MEV searchers and firms that specialize in new MeV engaging in riskier and potentially more dangerous behavior. There are various types of MEV attacks that are detrimental to the health of the network, where you're actually perpetuating these so called reworks, where you're rolling the chain back. So transactions that you thought were final are no longer final. They not even exist in the blockchain. And there are new novel attack vectors that exist because of this ability. So I think shrugging this problem as something that is not a problem, I think it's dangerous, because as things get more bearish, what we've seen is that the strategies get more creative and that creativity might entail an impact to real users of these networks through things like time banded attacks, which is really the worst case scenario for an mev attack, which actually entails sending transactions back to the mempool and disrupting several users. It does seem like there are some promising solutions to do this, but I definitely echo Lara's comments on we need to take this issue seriously and elevates the folks that are actually working on this."

        "text": "Yeah, so as I mentioned before, despite this one major issue ethereum otherwise had, by all accounts, is a really pretty good year. In addition to the successful merge, which obviously was an amazing technical feat, Ethereum used to face a lot of competition from other layer ones, the kind of saluna vax world, which obviously Solana and Luna are either nonexistent or struggling. So I was curious, kind of where you thought that was going to go if there were going to be credible competitors in 2023. Because related is sort of this scaling dilemma, because in 2022 we did see some of these layer twos take off. So I kind of wondered how you thought the scaling competition would play out in 2023."

        "text": "I think similar. Like you said, generally there's just going to be less appetite for projects that are just alternative layer ones because there's just less, there's going to be less speculation and less cash in the system overall. So I think those narratives will slowly kind of be less powerful as they were in 2022. On the other hand, exactly like you mentioned, I think layer twos are all kind of coming to the point where they're maturing as technology and, and especially in the bear market, there's slightly more time to build. You can take your time a little bit more prior to shipping and actually properly built product. I think that's going to be the largest focus. Obviously we already saw optimism arbitrum gain some traction and some activity. I think the first half of 2023 will be ZK rollops actually launching for the first time. I was optimistic this would happen in 2022. Unfortunately they didn't. I am now again optimistic this will happen in the first half of 2023. I think even the solutions that Polygon is building to transfer the proof of stake chain into Zke VM chain is really interesting. You have startnet launching relatively soon, ZK sync as well net scroll. Those projects are actually really advanced when it comes to technologically almost solving the scaling trilama in my opinion, while inheriting really good security for the system overall. And I think that's where most of the focus will be. What I think the dynamic that will be interesting is that a lot of these projects will have their own tokens. We already have optimism. Token arbitrary will no doubt do a token relatively soon. You have starknet that already said that they will have a token, all of these projects will have tokens. And then how does the value accrual look like for these projects? If they get a lot of traction, if it actually becomes a layer where a lot of the smart contract applications happen, how does that battle with the main chain, with Ethereum when it comes to investability? I think that's going to be really interesting to see and to witness as we go into the next bull market, hopefully within a few years. It's not completely clear to me which chain actually accrues the most value. If starknet becomes the most valuable or the most activity happens on Starknet and Ethereum is kind of just for validating those actions that happen there, then where does the value actually accrue? And I'm not totally clear on that. I don't think many people are actually."

And I think with Solana specifically, are the trade offs that come with that level of scalability actually worth it? I can tell you, trying to do on chain analysis on Solana was incredibly difficult in the aftermath of devtex collapse. Solana in one day produces more data than bitcoin produces in an entire year. That's roughly around 100gb of new data per day, which is quite drastic. And it entails some quite unique challenges when it comes to looking at historical information, because you need to go back in time and store that data historically to be able to answer some basic questions of, like, what was the balance of Alameda back in early 2022? A lot of nodes just discard that information by default. So transparency is not something that a lot of these l ones truly embraced, which I think now, because of the severity of the FTX collapse, will be top of mind and at times might be structurally incompatible with how these l one s were even designed from the get go. So there will be a gigantic, I think, push to improve the transparency of these networks. To give you one example of this, we found some really interesting mints of the serum decentralized exchange happening in Ethereum and going straight to Solana via Bridge. Non disclosed mints comprising about 60% of the circulating supply of serum. Just supply those. Just minted off thin air and sent to salon. Wait, when that took place, I believe in early 2022 and then mid 2022. So when we think about how did Sam make bail and was able to get bail money, just a percentage of it."

Right. There's a lot of transparency issues with a lot of these l one's that prevent you from being able to do due diligence at their full extent. And if it's true that VC's have also been through this reckoning of having to be more due diligent when it comes to investing new layer ones. I do think transparency will be at the top of the priorities, even more so than something like scalabilities now that we have roll up solutions that are fully scalable live. So I think it's something that layer ones will have to rethink. A lot of the layer ones that really made strides in the previous run will have to be redesigned so that they're more friendly towards on chain analysts and optional transparency as really a requirement for an investment."

You can say, well, everyone's watching the blockchain all the time. It's actually not true. Sometimes I find things randomly by manually scrolling through ether scan and no one found before, and it's like a really important thing. So I would say that needs to change as well into the next market. There need to be better monitoring tools. People need to pay more attention just in general, because exactly like Lucas said, there were a lot of things that we could have picked up on if we actually looked for the right things. Hopefully that will change. Second thing that I've learned as well is how important distribution of coins, and just in general, how these layer ones are actually distributed. People would say even if Solana is relatively decentralized, actually ultimately doesn't matter as much if so much ownership is concentrated in someone's pocket, that then ends up being a bad actor. We just see how much bad will and just bad attention. And just in general, the effect that something like this can have on a project itself, just because one person had a lot of the supply and was publicly associated with it. So those two things I would just point out to people that I think were kind of, I learned that they're more important than I initially thought based on some of these actions that happened in the last month."

        "text": "Yeah. Oh my gosh. I completely agree with you on that first point. Like in the days leading up to the collapse, when people couldn't find any wallets, that looks like cold storage for FTX. Like, that just effing blew my mind. I was like, how did nobody ever notice that before? Like, that is like what? The whole point of having an exchange is that you're supposed to store these things for people and protect them from being hacked. And the notion that they didn't even have anything like that was just like what? Like, you know, how did this never get noticed before? I kind of couldn't believe it. I was just, yeah, my jaw was on the floor. All right, let's talk about stable coins, which, you know, most people probably thought that this was sort of a sleepy part of the industry. And then lo and behold, when the macro environment completely changes, suddenly competition heats up. And this year we saw this battle in stable coins finance leveraged BUSD to try to take market share from circles, USDC, or at least, you know, who knows what they were actually trying to do. It just sort of seen that way a huge collapse of the world of algorithmic stablecoins, plus just the general fact that they've never really worked and tether somehow taking more criticism and yet surviving. What do you guys think will happen in the world of stablecoins in 2023?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Look, it's an insanely good business model in an environment like this. You look at crypto companies and the outlook for the next year, circle and tether, as well as paxels, they're insanely good position when it comes to their business health currently and how they will perform in 2023. Because as long as the interest rate keep relatively high and as long as they don't pay out any of that interest rate to users, they're literally printing cash. And we're talking about like large magnitudes. I don't think people realize, like, we're talking about like 100 billion total supply. You multiplied it by like roughly 5%. What you can get on that. It's a lot of money. And those companies will continue growing and continue doing well. And exactly like you said, there will be battle for those interest rates for their revenue because it's actually a lot. And I think binance understood that relatively early on. And obviously they're working with Paxos, and my understanding is that they have a 50 50 split when it comes to revenue. So actually this year, it might be a decent chunk of the total revenue that they make, even compared to trading fees and lending fees and all that, because it's just the environment is really favorable to stable coins. And I think just like the last bear market in 2018 2019, they've continued doing well. Like, of course there are some redemptions, but actually people continue using them. They're used for investments, they're used for trading, they're used for some commerce already as well. And they definitely have one of the largest product market fit in an environment where there's not as much speculation as before. So I think this is going to be actually, like, unironically, this is going to be one of the more exciting things to look out for in 2023, because it's just these companies will go at it and you will see circle talk smack about Paxos, you'll see them talking smack about tether. They'll just be going at it. And I think that could get interesting. 2023."

        "text": "Yeah. As an instrument to attain stability, I think the reserve backed stable coins have certainly achieved product market fit. I think the collapse of algorithmic stable coins like Luna, I think really shed light on the dangers of some of these structures. We also saw a lot of drama, for lack of a better word, within maker, with the assets that support DAi as a stablecoin. I think a lot of those concerns have been remedied at this point. But the reserve backed stablecoins, I think, are here to stay and have certainly attain substantial liquidity. We did one of our most popular state of the Network newsletters this year was an analysis of USDC and USDT. It's very clear if you look at when these assets are used, the time zones, when these assets are used the most. Tether has achieved a pretty strong product market fit in APAC. So a lot of very large liquidity providers in the Asia Pacific zone using tether as the instrument to attain portability between exchanges. Access services in Defi holds USD equivalents that attain level of stability, whereas USDC has achieved the same exact thing in the west. So if you look at Europe and US, USDC is the stable coin that's most predominantly used in specifically in us business hours. So the momentum with these stable coins is really difficult to break, because they are a core component of how a lot of these funds operate. I also think, while this is true, and they've certainly achieved product market fits, there's definitely large liquidity providers that are surviving through this bear market that leverage these products. I think they will also be scrutinized by regulators that are now taking a closer look into crypto assets, specifically. Now, from this risk perspective, because stable coins, even the reserve backed stable coins, they're not risk free, right? And when I'm talking about risk, it's really the potential for them to be exploited and that leading to chaos and destruction, which is a big part of my job at coinmetrics is thinking about these attack vectors. For a lot of these stable coins, one key can mint any arbitrary large units of these stable coins. One admin key enables you to mint potentially 1 trillion USDC, which for DeFi is a gigantic problem. Because if I can print a trillion dollars worth of USDC, I can just trade any market that has a pair with USDC and deplete all the liquidity in those markets because they're automated market makers EMmse structurally conceived to make markets regardless of who I am. So I do think there's going to be some scrutiny on the governance of stablecoins that will likely come in the form of regulation. I don't think it will kill these stable coins. I think these are problems like the presence of admin keys in nearly all reserve backed stablecoins that are somewhat irresponsibly implemented I think will be scrutinized, but not an impossible issue to solve. I just think its going to become top of mind because now you have this massive focus on security and really investor protection, which stable coins play a gigantic role in."

Whats interesting to me is it definitely had certain wins which were how during the great financial crisis of crypto in 2022, a lot of DeFi functioned very well, but trading is down and total value locked is down, although it's obviously because the value of the coins themselves have gone down. The thing is, the sector's also seen obviously a ton of hacks. So I wondered what you thought would happen in DeFi in 2023."

Ideally you get to a point where you have the FTX level of experience in terms of trading. I dont mean in terms of anything else or binance is a better example, but just something that works as well, that actually uses blockchains and allows people, lets say in China or people where maybe theres more restrictive activity to actually use these tools properly. You know, I think the UIDX probably gets the closest, but it's still not quite there yet. It's not there yet for multiple reasons and a lot of them go back to scalability. But regardless, I mean there's still a long way to go there. And I think with the collapse of FTX and with some of these liquidity concerns that you now have with exchanges like there are concerns that Genesis goes down, what impact they'll have on Gemini and those sort of concerns. I feel like we've seen every single exchange being illiquid on Twitter over the last three weeks. Those concerns can actually be addressed properly in DeFi. But I think the main roadblock is still the usability of these protocols. And I think hopefully that will be the focus of 2023, is to try to make something that people actually want to use, not just actually farm to make money out of, but something that I actually want to use. Just like I wanted to use finance or I want to use other products in the market."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I completely agree. I think product market fit is definitely going to be the biggest topic for Defi. I do think there are things that excite folks that go beyond the use cases that people are usually interested in in terms of trading. Uniswap is an amazing product, but the AMM model might not be the best for users. The fact that you don't know exactly what price you're going to get, the fact that your transaction will likely get sandwiched through MeV. I think there's a lot there that can be improved, but there are also things in DeFi that you can't really do anywhere else. The notion of a flash loan, which is a loan that you don't need to post collateral to attain pretty massive amounts of liquidity, as long as you're sending it back to the lender in the same transaction, is not something that you could do in finance. You could potentially do in finance, but it would be a contract thousands and thousands of pages long so that all the edge conditions are addressed. So there are some very unique use cases that I think will be tested. I think you have to have a strong foundation of services that you're providing. Things like flash loans for market efficiency, better lending protocols that manage risk more actively. And you also have to have products that are built on top of those foundations that potentially abstract away even the notion of that there's a blockchain in the background. There's going to be some trade offs in terms of centralization, of course. But I do think there's going to be this path where we need to focus more on what is unique about this technology that you really cannot do. And it's not just, oh, I'm going to buy and hold this token because it's going to go 20 x. You can't really blame people from doing this because historically that's what's happened. People want to be better off financially, so they're naturally gravitating towards these use cases. I think DeFi projects, they need to really distilled what is unique that they're doing. Focus more even on the front end side of things. Once you've determined from a foundational perspective what services you're providing and try to replicate in a non custodial fashion, the level of experience that you saw with things like FTX and even binance, when it comes to trading and lending. I think that will be critical to the success of DeFi, even from an investment perspective. VC's, I think, are now better aware of this dynamic. Given what happened to FTX and some trauma of that happening again. I think those solutions will also see funding."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Really good question. I think we've already seen some slightly higher activity towards the end of 2022. Again, I think NFTs have actually shown to be relatively resilient when it comes to keep coming back, when there have been almost like multiple mini cycles for NFts that I've seen over the last two years where the activity goes super high, people are speculating, and then all of a sudden goes down again and it recovers again. And I think the reason for that is that it's just a very easy concept for non crypto people to grasp, which is like, let's collect things that have. That have rarity to have value. I'll provide an anecdotal example. I do these lectures two or three times a year for university classes, and I do them just basically intro class to crypto as a whole. And the part that people always care about the most, and these are like 21, 22 year olds, is always the nfts. They just ask so many questions like, how can this be so valuable? Why should I be holding these things? Why apes? Why not punks? And I think it's because it's just a really relatable topic to younger people. And because of that, I think this will continue coming back up. In terms of interest, I don't know about the prices and I don't know about specific nfts, but I think there's also really large product market fit that maybe hasn't been as realized as it could be. There's no reason why some of the trading cards should not live on a blockchain, why people shouldn't be trading these things online instead of actually in person. So I think there will continue being a ton of development there. I don't know if this will happen in 2023, but it is something where I've personally seen enough evidence that this is a really, really sticky concept that will continue coming back, and it will be more and more used in some games and in some things overall, even though there is also this hate, like almost irrational hate, but by some normal people, there's also an insane amount of interest."

They need to compete with other marketplaces. And like you mentioned, some have followed, but some actually haven't. And I think the most pragmatic view that I have on this is that long term, this is not going to be a way to monetize nfts. It's going to have to be in a different way, purely because of the technical complexity of implementing something like this. And, for example, the OpenSea solution that we've seen, personally, I think it's a joke. I think it leads to, there is no point in nfts if this is how we will go about enforcing royalties, in my opinion, because it leads to effectively unfair competition, and it's almost like a really large player bullying all the other ones.

        "text": "Yeah, I think the royalties model is something that's really interesting because it is enhancing the utility of nfts to an extent that, in my opinion, make them a lot more exciting. I think right now, if you think about their utility, it is really as a mechanism to demonstrate wealth in a lot of ways, which I think is what, in a lot of circumstances, drives people into them. Like, how can this NFT be worth so much money? And I think for a lot of folks, it's a more tangible thing. Oh, I own this. This is mine. So they're naturally gravitating towards it. I do think I, with the NFT sector, if you will, of this industry, the marketplaces have taken a much more substantial role in making markets for nfts, determining really how these nfts will be issued. In a lot of ways imposing upon creators, as we just were talking about how these nfts should operate. I think there are a lot of technical issues that are circumvented by a centralized marketplace, but in some ways not in a positive way. I think marketplaces are going to be deeply scrutinized in 2023, I think for two reasons. I think the first reason is there's an argument that they do hurt the utility capability capabilities of what creators can do and the policies that creators can implement on who owns their nfts and what that represents. I think what excites me the most in terms of use cases goes beyond just, oh, I hold this, I own this. It's really, what can you do with it? If it's a song, for example, I'm particularly excited about music nfts. Can you create a system whereby you're receiving payouts from the song being used in a commercial fashion, be a commercial or a movie? Things like this, I think can be incredibly empowering to artists. But marketplaces, because they're trying to do so many things at the same time, I think they're unable to focus and explore. The other thing that I think will drive a lot of scrutiny to these marketplaces is that in 2021, we saw a pretty severe market manipulation taking place in a lot of these NFT marketplaces. There was a paper that has just come out in December of 2022 that focus on market manipulation, specifically watch trading in NFT marketplaces. And watch trading is when a buyer and a seller are the same entity or controlled by the same entity, and they're just making markets to simulate volume and potentially increase the prices of a specific asset. And this paper, I think, is really interesting because they found that $3.4 billion was used last year to pump NFT markets via wash trades. That happens predominantly on looksrare. Looksrare marketplace and attackers were highly sophisticated, not only in terms of manipulating specific NFT markets, but also manipulating the token disbursement mechanism that these markets use to reward their participants. So looksrare, for example, they have their own looks token, and it is issued on the basis of the volume that you're making the platform. So not only were these attackers manipulating these markets to increase the prices of nfts, that they had no interest in holding the long term, but they're also getting a disproportionate amount of the token in that platform for making so much market. And this analysis shows that there are some pretty large entities involved in doing this. So I do think as we continue to uncover instances of potential unhealthy behavior in these marketplaces, I think they're going to be scrutinized more aggressively by regulators. There are both good and bad things about this. I think the good thing about this is that it will really focus on adding more utility to nfts via more technical methods. I think there are services that might emerge as a result of this that might focus on specific parts of issuing nfts. Music, for example, I think is at this point under explored. But I think it will hurt some user experience because nfts have served this role as the stepping stone for a lot of new users into this industry. The marketplaces, they play a massive role when it comes to usability and interfacing with crypto. It's tough to make predictions, but it is something that I see being scrutinized in 2020."

        "text": "All right, so last question that I want to ask is, after the fall of FTX, binance is now incredibly dominant. And amongst crypto only exchanges accounts for nearly 90% of trading. Yet it's also reportedly the target of an investigation by the Department of Justice. So what do you guys think it means for the industry to have this one player in particular, binance, which, as I mentioned, likely has some regulatory baggage to be so dominant? And how do you think that could affect the industry in 2023?"

        "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's not ideal like we saw with FTX. FTX was probably ten times smaller in terms of the size, and it really, really affected the industry in a bad way. And the ripple effects have still, maybe not. Some of them have still not been seen yet, and it's been like month and a half or something. So, I mean, to answer your question very bluntly and pragmatically, it would be insanely bad if anything happened to binance. In my opinion, it's where most liquidity is for most spot pairs, for most futures pairs as well. And it's just, I don't think it's even comparable to anything in traditional finance. It just has like near perfect monopoly currently. And if something were to happen to it, including some regulatory issues or including anything else, it would have a really bad impact on the overall market. And on top of that, just like the faith in the industry alone, I think FTX alone in itself will have impact on regulation for years to come. And also in the faith of new entrants that maybe just started using FTX, they weren't familiar with any of these risks and ended up losing all their life savings. If that happened to binance and you have ten times more capital on the platform, and it's ten times more important for volume, for overall trading, it would be a complete disaster, in my opinion. I think it would be actually significantly worse than Mount Gox back in the day if something were to happen to binance. That being said, to be slightly more optimistic. I think of course binance will have regulatory issues in the US, just like BitMex did. Of course, initially in the first two years, they had very lax KYC. Everyone knows that if you wanted to use it without KYC, you could, you could just split your account between multiple and do the daily withdrawals. It was very simple. They've ramped it up really a lot over the last two years, like I just saw last few days, how they're still kind of harping on people to update their KYC. There's a lot of KYC now on Binance, and they're quite diligent. They have large compliance teams as well. But there is a lot of baggage from the early days, just like there was a lot of baggage with Bitmex. And now the question is, what could actually happen? Is it just going to be kind of a slap on the wrist fine that CZ can pay off 0.5% of his net worth, or is it actually going to be something slightly more significant? I personally think the risk of binance being affected so badly by regulations that it dies completely is quite low myself. But on the other hand, there could be an effect, and it scares me a lot that something could happen to binance and it would affect the entire industry for years and years and years. And I don't know if that would be recoverable. Probably would be, but it would be a really, really bad shock. And a lot of the questions we get from our customers these days is exactly what will happen to binance. People are actually really freaked out. They're freaked out about stablecoins, binance freaked out about tether, everyone's freaked out about everything. But binance would be by far the worst, in my opinion."

        "text": "I completely agree. It's terrifying the extent to which binance is now predominant in terms of liquidity in this ecosystem, I think to a very concerning degree. Not only because there might be regulatory scrutiny that gets potentially overreaching and impacts their ability to continue to provision liquidity, or something more concerning total regulatory scrutiny and really a massive decrease in liquidity in the market. So it is terrifying. I think it is something that will hopefully be addressed with more competition, both on the decentralized side with better products that are built on decentralized platforms, as well as better competition, but potentially by entities that were responsible, the coinbases of the world, which probably there are two or three of those at this point. It is to me a good thing for binance right now to see what lessons could be learned from the FTX collapse, I think especially related to BNB. To me, that's one of the areas that is the most unclear. I think we have a good sense of their reserves, even though their proof of reserves was lackluster in a lot of ways, could be completely manipulated if they wanted to. Their custody scheme is not super sophisticated or it's very simplistic. So we can see that they have a lot of reserves in the tokens that they support in their platform and have liquidity for my concern at this point is mostly around the transparency around BNB. BNB exists in three different blockchains, at least right in a native format. It exists in Ethereum as an ERC 20 token. It was how they initially raised funds. It exists in the binance smart chain, which is the Ethereum fork. It exists in the BnB chain, which is a Cosmos SDK implementation. There isn't a ton of transparency around historical supply for BNB, and at the same time there are some very concerning transactions where they likely minted quite a lot of BNB to sell to private entities like any other token debase other users. I think the time or the circumstances surrounding binance at this point will not be aligned with this type of activity. I do think they will have to bring a lot more transparency given their role as a central liquidity provider to the industry, not only on their reserves, but also their BNB holdings. The distribution of BNB across all of these blockchains, and potentially being a lot more, frankly, careful when it comes to new products that they launch, because now they are being further scrutinized. I will say that binance in 2017 is very different than binance today. From everything I can see, both on chain and off chain, it's completely different. It's a much more mature exchange and I think CZ has done a really good job maturing it. It is at the same time terrifying because there are these ghosts from the past that might haunt them, either because they might have not abided by all the regulations at that point in terms of Amlkyc, but also because they were operating on a much more experimental, carefree way, especially with the issuance and dynamics of the BNB token, we'll likely learn a lot more about Binance's operation, either because of this investigation or because of voluntary disclosures. Hopefully the latter. But it is something that I think will get scrutinized in 2023 as well, because of their role now as the predominant liquidity provider in the industry."
