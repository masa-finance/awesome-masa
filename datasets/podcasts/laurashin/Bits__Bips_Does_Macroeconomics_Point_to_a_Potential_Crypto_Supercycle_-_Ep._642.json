I'm your host, James Seyffert tradfi Archmaester Lord of Bloomberg's end, here with Alex Kruger. Kruger, macro of House Asgard, protector of the Realm, and Joe McCann, Lord commander of asymmetric and master of bank. We're here to discuss the latest stories in the worlds of crypto and macro news. Just remember that nothing we say here is investment advice. Check unchained crypto.com for more disclosures. Let's get into it. Alex and Joe, you guys are both portfolio managers, traders. This last week we had a Fed meeting. We had some other economic reports, non farm payrolls. What were your takeaways? I guess we'll start with you, Joe, and then go over to Alex."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, sure. So, I mean, Wednesday I thought was pretty clear what Jerome Powell was articulating and communicating to you directly. He's literally saying, you know, more or less, there's no stagflation, there's no chance of more hikes. I don't want to say no chance. There's very few slim chance of hikes going forward. Um, and, you know, because what they did with their actions of, of moving the, um, the balance sheet tapering down from 60 billion to $25 billion a month, that's a net improvement of $35 billion of liquidity on a monthly basis. It's, it's just doesn't make any sense for him to be hawkish at his press conference if they're tapering their balance sheet reduction. Um, so, you know, our view, and my view, I guess, uh, has been for quite some time that employment data is actually the most important thing for determining if and when the Fed will have coverage to actually start cutting rates. And this kind of leads into the NFP report that came out early Friday. Well, lo and behold, you saw a tick up in the unemployment rate and a miss on NFP. And almost instantaneously you saw two rate cuts get priced into the Fed funds futures curve. Right. So from my perspective, this is kind of what I've been expecting for quite some time, is that, yes, inflation is important and if the Fed has a dual mandate. Right, but the employment data has just been so strong for so long that the Fed has literally signals, the FOMC more broadly, has literally signaled that we want to cut rates at some point. This kind of gives them, I guess, a reason to. And so, you know, the, I think that what you saw also in price action on Friday was indicative of that. Like, you know, the day of the Fed, bitcoin finally cracked. Fifty nine k and a brutal washout, if you will, that had fallen from the last day of April, which appears to effectively be the bottom, based on what happened with the macro last week, particularly with the Fed. And so I think that there's probably a good chance, based on what happened with the price action on Friday, which is a full, more or less reversal in risk. But also, more importantly, the dollar is topping out, has topped out, started to reverse pretty heavily, started to see fixed income get bid. This all suggests, at least from my perspective, the end of the feds tightening and also a strong us dollar cycle."

It's basically just looking at employment data that we're getting from here there. And you also talk about tapering. The thing there was that he said that basically they were going to decrease the amount of bonds that they were, or debt assets that they were unloading onto the market. So that should be more liquidity, I guess, which we all know bitcoin and crypto love anything that pumps liquidity. So, Alex, anything different from Joe, in your point of view, or anything to add? Alex?"

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, I actually see things, unfortunately, very, very similarly. I say unfortunately because it would be fun to, to disagree and are you here? But yeah, it's pretty much the same view. It's the bottom is very likely in. Powell has signaled very, very effectively and clearly that he's not concerned with inflation the way some people in the market want to be concerned about personally. Something else I would like to add, is that more important than actually we get one cat or two cats or three or whatever? More important is there's two things. One is the direction, the fact that the direction is down. And secondly, the fact that we have a fed put basically something that's been in place since December. Basically, the moment back in December was the moment in which the Fed before MC via Powell told us very, very clearly that they are equally concerned about employment and inflation, which was not the case basically since January of 2022. That basically means that if things go bad, there is a put. The put basically means the head is going to cover our losses and ensure that markets don't implode."

You can see these orange lines are just basically the, the number of cuts that we're expecting. So you can see by January, pretty much the market is expecting at least 225 basis point cuts."
    },

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "And the other thing I'd like to add is that it's all one trade. Now. This is something new that we just started seeing now is bitcoin for actually all of 23, or most of 23 did its own thing, kind of like correlated on a very zoomed up basis. But you zoom in and it's doing entirely its own thing. And this started changing recently with Israel and Iran. And we saw it very clearly last week. FOMC and payrolls, it traded hand in hand with equities, which in my humble opinion, many people disagree. But if you're bullish on equities and risk assets, this is very good because it means that. And if you think that there is a fed put this is very good because it means equities won't collapse. Therefore, the probability, always talking in probabilities of bitcoin actually doing its own thing and imploding 80% becomes very dim."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah, I agree. Another thing to point out as it relates to some of the macro stuff, over the course of the entire month of April, actually heading into the end of March, we started to see global liquidity actually pull back. This is not just, say, the Fed or just the bank of China. This is the shadow monetary system. This is the volatility index associated with treasuries. As known as the move index. All these things come together with the various central banks kind of restricting and reversing the q one advance, if you will, of global liquidity. And for those who may not necessarily understand the value or the purpose behind why global liquidity is so important is that when you have more liquidity in a system, it tends to juice risk assets. Now, when you have a strong dollar, sometimes those risk assets will not rise as high as they possibly could. However, one of the things that's happened just in the past week plus certainly last week, was the japanese yen. The dollar yen trade got up to 100, 160, which was the 1990 high. So we're talking to whatever, I don't know, however many years. That is a lot. I am not a mathematician. It's a long time ago, right? 33 years or something. 34 years, something to that effect. Right. And at that moment, the Ministry of finance intervened and smashed the yen shorts from 160 down to 153, which is a major move in foreign exchange. Like this isn't crypto. This is a market trades $4 trillion a day, and a move the yen like that is remarkable. And more importantly, on April 29, we actually had the second highest net short interest in the yen ever. So it was almost perfect time to squeeze the shorts. And the Ministry of Finance in Japan certainly did that. And they also did it again a couple of days later. And the reason this is important, to Alex's point, at least from my perspective, is it being all one trade, is that we have actually seen emerging market effects, certainly Asia effects, EM effects. So these are like your India rupee, the thai baht, the south korean won, et cetera, et cetera. These call them smaller developed, developed or developing economies, currencies. They've just gotten decimated by the us dollar, including the chinese yuan. And all of that is reversing post FOMC and certainly post NFP. And this is, I think, very, very, very important, because we have some precedents of this that occurred back in 2016. Janet Yellen was the head of the Fed at the time. She flew out to Shanghai in late February, and the same sort of thing was happening. You had sort of EMFX getting kind of unfairly affected by the us dollar. She was talking about hiking rates. Rates were zero then. Remember the gory days? And China basically nuked the US stock market by devaluing the currency. And so she had to go back there and kind of like, let's all get together and figure out something. Now, you can't find anything official about this. It's called the Shanghai Accord, but it happened one way or the other because it actually marked the tick lows in the S and P and the dollar weakened. Well, she was in Southeast Asia a few weeks ago, about a month ago. And since then, what weve noticed is a pretty dramatic shift, certainly in the past couple of weeks of Asia affects currencies and their values relative to the US dollar. So the long story short here is from my perspective, youre getting a repeat of the Shanghai accord again, whether or not that actually took place, the market is suggesting that. And when you have basically a bottom in the yen and you have a bottom in the chinese yuan and other sort of emerging market currencies, that means that tends to imply a weaker dollar. And when you have a weaker dollar, to Alex's point, you have a better chance of things all being one trade because people are going to have less, you know, holding the dollar is less desirable, at least from a short term to intermediate trading perspective. And so what's the furthest thing out on the risk curve? Well, it's crypto. So bitcoin should do well in this type of an environment, assuming that the dollar strength has actually kind of come to its end. And I think it has, especially given what the Fed has stated going forward, I think you have to be looking at how the dollar trades towards these other currencies and use that as a proxy for how to evaluate how much money will flow into risk assets. Oh, two more really quick things. One, there's actually flows now heading into, uh, Asia, Hong Kong and China, particularly for the first time in months. So we have net flows into investment dollars into those areas. And then last night, so it's Monday today, so late Sunday night, early Monday, uh, I guess, uh, China time, you had a 300 pips move in the yuan, which is an enormous move, uh, for, for the foreign exchange currency. So especially something like yuan. So there appears to be the market sniffing this out that the dollar's reign, at least in the intermediate to immediate term, has kind of paused. And this is, in my opinion, incredibly bullish for risk assets."

This honestly echoes things for me from 2013, when I first joined the industry. The number one ETF in the world back then was wisdom trees Japan equity hedge ETF, which basically shorted the yen and went long. Yen companies, japanese companies, and it was on fire. It absolutely took over the ETF world. So kind of giving me a flashback to that before we move on. Alex, do you have anything else left on macro on that side of things on the yen?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I just wanted to add one thing that I think is maybe interesting for people is the fact that when the yen was basically plummeting, dollar yen going up, right, there is this tendency among traders, circles and the media to basically find a reason to, to just panic about anything. In this case, the thing is actually dollar yen. The yen weakening is actually in the benefit of Japan because weaker yen basically means that Japan is importing inflation. Wages go higher, eventually inflation expectations go higher, which is actually happening. And this is exactly what Japan has been trying to achieve for over two decades. So it's kind of like they want this. What they don't want is volatility and the depreciation or appreciation of the currency. That's what they care about a lot, is keeping volume rather subdued. But it's not really the yen plummeting that hasn't getting concerned. They actually want it or maybe not wanted, but it's beneficial for them."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, it makes things that we get as Americans and others from Japan a lot cheaper for us to get. Exposure to those assets helps those, any companies that export. So I guess we'll move on a little bit to a little bit more. My area of specialty real quickly on Ethereum ETF's levered future Ethereum ETF's, there's been a bunch that have been filed, we're almost a month in since they were filed. Typically when these futures ETF's, they go through a different process than spot bitcoin ETF's. When these levered futures ETF's are filed, it's this other process. And usually when the SEC isn't going to allow something under this process, rule six C eleven, which we don't really need to get into, it's a special ETF rule. But usually what the SEC will do is they'll be like, all right, you have to withdraw this. We're not allowing this through. This isn't going to happen. And you just see people just withdraw en masse. What happened with the first Ethereum futures ETF's is volatility shares and others basically said they were going to run the red light. And if the SEC wanted to stop them, they were going to have to sue them. And the SEC likely knew that they were going to lose because they were already in the, at that time, they were going to lose the grayscale. So that means to us that we're a month in, it seems likely that we're going to see levered Ethereum futures ETF's. And the question I've been getting all week and the week before is, well, if those are going to be approved and we're going to talk about the Hong Kong ETF's and that's happening, doesn't that mean that the spot Ethereum ETF's are going to get approved here? So you're going to see delays for other ETF's here for spot Ethereum. The deadline, the only deadline that matters is May 23, 24th for Vanek and Ark. That's the equivalent of the spot bitcoin ETF reach, which was the Jan. 10th deadline. We're like 1015 percent odds of these things going through. It's just not going to happen. There's been no movement. We just think that these things are likely to be denied. I don't know if you guys have a different view there, curious."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Why don't you interrupt and ask you, what do you think if you had to say, what is the most likely high for an ETH ETF to be approved? Spot one, right. When would that be? Sometime in 25. Would it require new applications, that kind of thing?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, so, I mean, what we've had, what we saw with the spot bitcoin ETF's and what we're going to see here is they're going to get, as I said, I think they're going to be denied. And just like the spot bitcoin ETF's, everyone just refiles. We have some that aren't due until November. Like, bitwise is one of the last ones to enter and they're not due until end of November. For a decision, you have to take a step. I don't think these things are going to get through until 2025. I'd say by the end of 2025, I think it could happen. That said, if the SEC goes out, and we can talk about the consensus lawsuit real quick if we want, but basically consensus is suing, going out and proactively suing the SEC, trying to get clarity on the fact that they believe the SEC thinks ethereum is a security. Basically, the SEC has three options here coming up on May 23, they either approve, which, as I just said, not unlikely to happen. Right. Or they find some other reason to deny these things or kick the can down the road further. I think that's what they're going to do. I think that's what they're going to do. I think they might use correlations to do that, but there's no way to know for sure. I think it's basically going to be a word salad. Legal jargon might be something that they like, particularly if it's correlation. It's fact based. I don't think anyone can bring a lawsuit the way that grayscale did on bitcoin. So then all of a sudden, you just need the data to prove that the SEC's argument then doesn't matter. Which I think the data, if you look at the correlation data by this time next year, by early 2020, 2025, the correlation will be strong enough, even stronger than the bitcoin ETF's when they were. That falls to the wayside. The third option is just denying saying it's a security."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I got to say it's crazy. The emphasis on correlation that has been placed. I mean, it's absolutely insane. The year is 2024, and we're talking about this thing. It's insane that it was such a big driver for the bitcoin ETF. And I'm saying this because the futures and spot series are co integrated. They're kind of like the same series driven by the same thing. So, of course, the correlation is going to be almost perfect almost all the time."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. So, like, I've gone in the weeds pretty deep on this correlation stuff. What you need to realize is Gensler and the SSC were backed into a corner, as far as I'm concerned. Even the democratic commissioners, Caroline Crenshaw, and I'm blank on the other one, they still dissented. They didn't want to approve bitcoin ETF's, but Gary had to, like, all right, we need to find a way that we can approve this. And they came up with this correlation analysis in their approval letter, and, like, the last three years, has been sufficiently correlated between futures markets and spot markets. But as you said, Alex, like, anyone in these markets know, like, that's just kind of bonkers in a way, because the futures price is determined off of the underlying spot price based on a bunch of exchanges. So it's. It's literally like an index that's based off underlying spot markets that determine the price of futures. So, like, they are co integrated, as you said, like, this argument is wild. The problem is the futures themselves didn't really trade enough. You go back three years, they weren't trading enough. So if you look by minute by minute correlations, or every five minute and like five minute candles, the correlation's all wonky. It's not great because there just weren't trades. But when anytime there is trades, there's like a near 99% correlation between futures and spot. The argument the SEC would make is like, well, if they're not trading, then we can't detect any manipulations that happen in the spot market. But anytime there is trade. So, like my recommendation would be just make sure every time there's a minute that goes by and a futures contract doesn't trade, just trade it. And all of a sudden the SEC loses the argument. I think theyre going to lean on something like that. It might not necessarily be exactly that. I think theyre just going to look for to kick the can down the road a little bit further. And consensus is trying to force them into a corner. Theres a lot of people trying to push them into a corner on declaring whether ETH is security or not. One of my pet theories is I think that the SEC, I dont think theyll be able to call ETH security. In many ways that would put them at odds with the CFTC. They have complete opposite stance. So I wonder if theyre going to try to thread some needle and basically say that staked ETH specifically is a security and regular ethnic, which again, I'm not saying that's a logical way to look at things, but I think that's something that they're trying to do. And I also think that Genzel and SEC likely know they're going to lose some of these lawsuits."

        "text": "Preston, do you think that there's, do you think the lack of institutional interest in Ethereum is having an effect here? I mean, let me kind of like walk you through my hypothesis here. Right. GBDC was more or less the way to get exposure to bitcoin from an exchange traded product sense for the most part. Yes, I know there's futures and all that kind of thing, right. But there's also eth. And if you look at the aums of each of those, call it pre spot approval, bitcoin ETF spot approval, it's like a fraction of bitcoin. And if you talk to a lot of folks in tradfi, which I'm sure you do, James, I know Alex and I do as well. When they think of crypto, there's interest in bitcoin. There has been interest in bitcoin, and that's the stuff that you see folks like Tom Lee at Fundstrat have been talking about for a long time. Yes, Fundstrat covers other cryptocurrencies as well, but, but it just feels like there was this sort of obvious pent up demand institutionally for this product. And yes, you have Blackrock, and yes, you have all of these other column conspiracy theories or not as to why the bitcoin ETF would get approved. But from my anecdotal experience speaking with folks in trad five, particularly asset managers or PM or portfolio managers, there just isn't a ton of interest as it relates to Ethereum. And do you think this is true or does this have any influence on part of the reason why you guys have a 10% approval chance in late May?"

Gensler basically is only going to do it when he's forced to, it seems like. And basically that's what happened with grayscale and the bitcoin ETF's. That said, I wholeheartedly agree with you. I mean, you dont even need to look at just ETH. You can look at the ETH futures ETF's launch. You probably dont even remember it happening. It happened in early October, and we thought our argument was that it was going to be a dud. So I thought it was going to be a dud and it was even more of a dud than I expected. Basically, no one really even cared. I thought maybe it was because theyre expecting spot to come, because we think spot bitcoin. No one really likes futures ETF's. For the most part. They're inefficient. They have to roll. There's a lot of inefficiencies there, right. But no matter how you slice it, when you talk to people, I talk to advisors at these different conferences, they just get the idea of a digital alternative to gold that makes more sense, even if it's 5 million times more volatile than gold and what have you. There's just this overwhelming understanding there of just. I don't see the same interest for true Defi on the Ethereum world."

It kind of was on a trading side of things, it didn't trade all that much, but to give you some numbers. So I've argued. So I think. Do you know the number?

So I was arguing wed see 15% to 20% of the demand for ETH. My boss, Eric Baltunos, thinks its going to be 10% or less because hes not paying attention to the space really much at all, unless its in the ETF world and hes just not hearing any interest. But if you look at the Hong Kong one, they launched in the same day, so far theyve been trading. There was a holiday last week, so it was a bit of a dud. So you cant pay attention too much to the volume. But as a percentage trading, the Ethereum ETF's in Hong Kong are about 15% to 16% of the total trading volume. But the assets are about 20%. So we have about $267 million in the bitcoin ETF's there and about 55 million in Ethereum ETF. So it's not a complete wash, it's not completely nothing. It's just the people thinking that this was going to be a massive multibillion dollar market immediately in the way that the US was. Just didn't really understand the size of the markets here. I mean, the us spot bitcoin ETF's are about 50 billion in assets. The entire Hong Kong market is less than that. Every ETF, not just these crypto ones. That said, these things are trading heavily compared to their market. They're doing exceptionally well for their market. It's just like you can't compare a market that's $47 billion in size to a US ETF market that is nearly 9 trillion in size. It's literally all the orders of magnitude. It's not really comparable."

In fact, I think we checked the other day, we saw the other day that if we look at the top holders of Ibit, the number one guy or the number two guy is a Hong Kong counterparty. So they already have access to us ETF. So why Hong Kong ETF's how much you need to have it denominated in Hong Kong dollars. And the other one was the 401K industry, or the 401 ks and pensions in Hong Kong is tiny. So that is not there anymore. But anyhow, something I wanted to add here. It's just an interesting data point. It's not precise, but I recall looking at ETF's, launching an ETF and what it would take to basically break even. And the number was about 30 million in Aum dollars to basically break even. So at 50 million, you're doing very well. And all the us ones, they're all doing extremely well."

But for the most part, our rule of thumb is if you're over 50 you're probably doing at least okay. And if you're over 100, you're almost certainly making money, unless you're in some like something that's costing you a real ton of money, like GBTC."

        "text": "They're going to launch a GPC mini trust and actually I have proof from three years ago arguing that this is what scales should do. They're doing a little differently. My argument was they should cut the fee a little bit when they launch GBTC and then just keep it relatively high, like keep it way above the market and then launch a competing mini product, which is something we've seen ETF's issuers do a bunch in the past. So basically they become these liquidity kings. Everyone uses them. There's people that are trapped in them for capital gains reasons if they're in taxable accounts and the money will just stay there and they can milk those fees. But when then what they'll do, rather than letting other people cannibalize their own assets, they'll be like all right, we're just going to launch a very similar product at literally a fraction of the cost and then we'll let people, if they're going to leave our stuff, hopefully they'll stay with us and they'll go to other product and we can attract flows so that other cheaper product can still compete. What they're doing is unique and something I have never seen before in this way is they're launching a GBTC minitrust. It's going to be ticker BTC. I think the fee they said is 0.15%. Don't quote me on them. Exactly. And like 10% of GBDCs assets are just going to spin off directly into that thing. So thats a way to basically theyre funding this minitrust. Theyre giving people who have stuck with them a long time what will be the lowest cost ETF product for bitcoin in the world. Actually, I guess theres technically zero fee ones, but theyre lending out bitcoin and stuff in Europe, but the lowest cost one in the US at the very least, its a very unique strategy. Theyre trying to keep people and then well see how it plays out for them long term. But I think its a smart move long term. I mean, if the way to think about everyones like they need to the fees one they do, theyve seen a lot of, im going to show a chart of their outflows, but its been brutal for them. This chart is just absolutely insane. But at the same time, if youre used to making 2% fees and you cut to 150 bps or 1.5%, thats a lot to cut. Lets go in from two hundred k a year to year, let alone going down to 15,000 a year, which is what 15 bps is, which is what theyre doing with this GBTC mini trust. Theyre basically just trying to make sure they keep the revenue up without coming belly up. And as you see, thats been brutal for them. But on the end there, you can see that little green blip. So in the bottom chart of those bars, thats GBTC finally saw an inflow on Friday. We saw basically every ETF across the board see inflows on Friday. Even despite that, you were talking about the outflows and things getting hammered midweek. The ETF saw overdose 400 million in outflows last week, even with the Friday inflows. So last week was brutal for the bitcoin ETF's, but they operated exactly as they're supposed to. They basically gave you exposure to the underlying asset. And anytime demand and supply were outstripped in one way or the other, we end up with inflows and outflows and they've been operating very smoothly."

Right, the week that we have a break of 59k, they run the stops down to 56.5. And I think it was like 500 million plus in outflows on May 1, the day of the Fed. On Friday, you have the NFP print cuts get priced back into the market and GBTC actually has inflows. I mean, you cant make this stuff up. This is only possible in a place like crypto, where the kind of villain forever is now seen as almost a hero.

And this kind of got things wrong. You can see that there was this massive discount when all that selling was happening, but that only really happened because of the way that these ETF's and their nav is calculated. So the underlying value of the bitcoin is calculated over a time weighted average from 03:00 p.m. to 04:00 p.m. because that's how the CME bitcoin futures market works. The CF benchmarks bitcoin rate. And so what happened is bitcoin was just tanking every single day. So basically it was starting 03:00 at one price and ending 04:00 at another price. And it made it look like there was these discounts and all these ETF's were mispricing and people were latching onto that. But really it was just like, no, the underlying value of the bitcoin is taken at an average of over that hour. And those two days, both days, we saw massive selling into the close of equity markets. So that's one unique thing. I would point out to people that were concerned about issues with these ETF's, they're still operating exactly as they're supposed to. And if you look at the underlying value of the bitcoin, the ETF's are tracking them neck and neck very, very, very closely."

Like, on one hand, the thing is, on the macro side of things, on macroeconomics, the global economy is what you could call early stage. And you could see this by basically industrials and manufacturing for the first time in years. And it just started a few months ago, starting to grow. And not just grow it. This is happening across the world. It's not just the US. And you can also see this in basically the price of copper ramping up. So on the econ side of things is early cycle. On the risk asset side of things, we got ahead of ourselves as we always do. I mean, that's how markets operate. It makes sense for the slope of things to be shallower with periods of volatility coming in every now and then. We just happened making people panic about the end of things. I think bitcoin has a long way to go. And I think equities have a long way to go. This could be something like the nineties and we're like 1997. The bursting of the bubble is. I don't see it.

Even like manufacturer construction in the United States is just ripping right now. The price of lumber is collapsing. The price of oil is collapsing. I saw a stat that blew my mind today that there's only two states in the United States where home inventory is dropping. So you have inventory rising in every single state except Nevada, which I think is -12% and the state of New York, which is minus one. So call it flat, if you will. 48 states are seeing rises in inventory of homes. So I dont know. To me it doesnt feel like from a macro perspective were anywhere close to this sort of cycle top. If you. I was chatting with a friend over the weekend. Hes like you think s and p goes to 6000. I was like, minimum. Look at what just happened with the Fed this past week. That the treasury's adding liquidity in the system. If Jenny Elgin can buy off the run bonds in the market, particularly the long end of the curve, like 30 year, it's not YCC, it's not yield curve control, but kind of looks like it. She can kind of. If she can kind of keep a lid on that interest expense 30 years out, that's great. The Fed can handle the front end of the curve if they end up cutting rates as well. So to me it feels like just looking at it from that perspective suggests weve got a pretty long way to go. And I was chatting with Raoul Paul last week and he had an idea that I tend to agree with. Id love to get your guys thoughts on this, that I think a lot of people are underweight, the right tail of the distribution of outcomes, meaning just, just crazy bonkers rise, particularly in crypto to say something like 10 trillion total market cap or something to that effect. I see a lot of chatter. Some folks I completely discount saying that the top is in for bitcoin. That's nonsense in my opinion. Other folks saying that we're probably getting to get to 100k bitcoin maybe 110, 115. I don't see hardly anybody really beyond, like, Cathie Wood. Right. Like anyone suggesting that bitcoin could be trading 200, 5300k, that ethereum's trading 10,000, Solana's trading 1000. I don't really see a lot of that. And that actually makes me even more bullish and increasing the probability of the right tail actually occurring over the course of the next, call it 12, 18, 24 months. Something, something to that effect. Are people actually, from your perspective, James or Alex, like underweight, the right tail here as it relates to potential super cycle or bubble."

There is a lot of people that still haven't fully bought in on the same side. I talked to plenty of people and it really, particularly in this space, when I talk to people at these crypto type events, it doesn't seem like anyone's underweight. The right deal. Seems like people are very risk seeking in this space. I guess do with that information with you, and that's completely anecdotal. But yeah, there definitely seems to be a lot of tepidness from like the data that I look at in the tradfi world. I mean, rates are so high. Why, if you can get over 5% in a money market fund right now and like, yeah, maybe you could earn like double that or maybe more in like equities or something else, but there's plenty of people that are just fine sitting on that."

Shes basically going to continue to fund the government by issuing short dated paper. And if you can still earn five and a half percent annualized for a four week t bill, I mean, thats pretty good. Right. But at some point, at some point, I think folks are going to end up emptying the coffers or certainly starting to slowly drain it out of there because they're going to see the mag seven ripping again. S and P makes new all time highs and five and a half percent if you're a pension fund and you need to hit your seven 8% annual target, sure. Right. They have loads of fixed income already in their portfolios, but other folks, retail portfolio managers, et cetera, you're going to end up seeing that cash chase risk, especially if the dollar actually starts to drop in value, which it, in my opinion, has topped. And as that continues to decline in value, people are less likely going to just be parking their cash in a five or five and a half percent money market fund, which also, if you look at real rates right now, for the Fed to be running tightening policy as high as they have for this long, with real rates as high as they are, something's got to give there. When the cycle turns, the real rates tend to not stay as high as they have been for this long. So that's another thing I think is an important indicator to keep track of is how real rates actually respond to a weakening dollar, potentially rate cuts as well as, I would say, lower volatility in the bond market, if they can do this. You kind of think of Yellen and Powell as like Kobe and Shaq, one controlling the front end of the curve, the other just controlling the back."

Basically he's talking about the difference in the fact that I know there's probably a lot of people listen to still trust the government data on inflation, but essentially the interest rates that the Fed is offering right now is above what the official inflation rates are. So it's technically, what's the word? Restrictive, if you will. So by cutting rates, that would be less restrictive or dovish or what have you. So that's what Joe was speaking about there. For those of you who weren't able to follow, we're finishing up here. We only got a couple of things left. Robinhood just got a wells notice.

And these momentum ignition algorithms, which are market abuse algorithms, just hammered bitcoin. But other assets, they pulled back too, from a correlation trade. But pretty much as we sit here now, bitcoin's down 90 bps on the day, and it was down quite a bit more after that headline came out. And during us stock trading hours, some of these other alts are brushing it off. I think that is actually pretty telling. And also we saw this last week when I altcoins and bitcoin specifically plunged to the deaths that they did. There was bad news, if you will, and the market was starting to bottom on bad news. And so it feels like were in one of these scenarios now where bad news is good news and good news is good news, everything is good news.

Its hard for me to see a scenario that PayPal makes that decision if they feel that theyre going to get slapped by the SEC for something or that a stable coin bill isnt going to actually pass."

But he does think theres a decent chance that wed get some sort of clarity for the first time in this space on whats going to be required and happen to stablecoins, or crypto dollars, as I like to call them sometimes. Anything to add, Alex?"

Everybody who knows him speaks so well of him. And binance is still out there. Fans have been safe, as he says, and clearly they have had so many chances to run away with the money and still there. So I think it's a good ending for the story, and hopefully the industry can use that to move forward to the next stage, which is very welcome. Increased regulation right across the world."

It's just, you know, I had this running joke with friends of mine, especially people that work with me at asymmetric. I'm like, once you work in crypto, can you possibly work in any other industry? You cannot get this level of entertainment anywhere. And the fact that it was four months, I mean, at first I thought it was fake news, and then I was like, no, no, it's actually real. He's getting four months. Unbelievable."

Cause I think people were saying he was thinking about five months, and then the judge changed it to four months, so, like, they got it wrong. And then I was like, mike got. The guy sitting next to me was like, did you hear he got four months? Like, no, he didn't. I just saw five months 30 seconds ago. And I sure enough went back. I was like, this. You cannot make this shit up. But, I mean, honestly, he. He blatantly broke the law, and, you know, he needed there. There. They weren't just going to let him go without serving any time whatsoever. But it's basically a slap on the wrist. So he definitely gave somebody a lot of information and obviously kept people's assets safe. So I'm sure we'll. This won't be the last we hear of him or of it. So he'll still be around. I mean, he's. I think they said he's going to be the. He's going to be the richest person ever in us history to be in prison, which is just fitting for. For this industry, honestly."
