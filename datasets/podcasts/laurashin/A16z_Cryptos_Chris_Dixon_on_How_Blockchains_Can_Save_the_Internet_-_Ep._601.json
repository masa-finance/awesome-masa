        "text": "Yeah, I blogged for years, like 2000, I think eight through 13 era, and I've always liked writing and been now in the crypto space for about ten years. I find that what we were working on sort of blockchains and crypto, I believe is a very misunderstood topic. It's partly misunderstood due to faults of our own meaning, the industry. There's a lot of focus in the industry on trading and speculation, and of course there are these giant catastrophes like FTX. We were not investors in FTX, but regardless, having these kinds of things happen in industry sullies the image. I believe there's another side to all of this, and this is side that I think I work on and a lot of friends of mine work on, which is what I would describe as the productive use cases for blockchains and tokens and a way in which they can, as I argue in my book, make the Internet a place that works better on behalf of users and creators and software developers and the people that use the Internet and returns the Internet to a lot of its original ideals from the 1990s. I felt like that message was not getting through. And I had tried, like a lot of people in industry, I had gone out and written blog posts and podcasts and spoken to lots of people, and in that process felt that it's just simply a story that needed a longer treatment and specifically needed to, to bring in some context from the history of the Internet, explain a little bit of the inner workings of how this technology works, and then really dive deeply into different practical applications that affect people's lives. And I found that the ultimately, I concluded that the only way to really do that was in the form of a book and something, my book's 230 pages in the main text, something that was not a super long book, but enough that it really gave the full context the other thing I would say is that there's, and I'm sure we'll talk about it, there's a lot of active policy discussions going on around crypto and regulation, and I spent a lot of time in the last couple of years with lawmakers and policymakers. And in every meeting, the question is at the end, what book should I read? And there are a lot of great books, including your book. There's great books on the history of Ethereum and Coinbase and bitcoin. But I didn't feel like there was a 2024. What are the societal benefits of this technology written in a way that didn't presuppose any background in the Internet or blockchains? You could take an average citizen and average. Someone told me to write a book for a smart high school student when I started writing, which was advice that stuck with me, don't assume any background knowledge. Avoid jargon. Explain things from first principles. I didn't feel like there was a book that sort of explained all that and why the technology can benefit society and therefore shouldn't be just sort of banned and regulated away. Like there is a positive aspect to it. And so I felt there was a need for that. And the downturn happened. I started writing it after things like a lot of the kind of blow ups of, I guess, what it was, 2021 and 22, or I think early 2022. And for me also, it was sort of a personal mission in that I wanted to, I think it was Richard Feynman or somebody who said, if you can't explain something to, I forget what it was, a ten year old, you don't really understand it, or something. It's some famous science quote like this. And I felt like, look, if I really believe that blockchains are critical for creating a better Internet, I should be able to really kind of write that out and explain it in detail in a way that doesn't presuppose anything. A lot of times in the space, people will use these words like decentralization as an example. I think the word might be in the book, but it's certainly not. I don't rely on that word. I really go into the specifics. And I felt like that was part of what I challenged myself with personally, is really show this in detail, how this has positive effects on people, and how you can create Internet services that are more democratically controlled, where the money and the power and all the sort of important things flow to the participants of the network and not just these big centralized intermediaries. And so for me, it was also kind of just frankly, a personal challenge just to really kind of go and work out all these ideas. I thought naively it would take me like a few months. And then, of course, it took me at least well over a year of a lot of work. And I had, you know, I had a bunch of really talented people also help me out and give me detailed feedback and other things. But in the end, it was a very, I don't know, you've written books, so I think, you know, but it was in the end a kind of gratifying process and I'm excited to get it out."

Because I was really struck by just how simple and accessible a lot of these descriptions were. And even for myself, especially in the earlier parts of the book, I was learning things, which goes to show that because obviously crypto came later in the Internet and I was not this earlier. So I do definitely think it's worth checking out for."

And also, by the way, I'll mention it's broken into both chapters, but also three to four page blog posts like chunks. And specifically to your point, what I was imagining was that if you're like you and you've done crypto, maybe the Internet history stuff would be more interesting. And then there's a lot of people that know Internet, like veterans like me, Internet veterans who know the Internet history but maybe don't know the, the blockchain stuff. And then the third part of the book where I go into more specific how to do token designs, some applications there, im kind of distilling, I think, the best knowledge of a bunch of smart entrepreneurs that I work with. And so im hoping even for entrepreneurs like cutting edge entrepreneurs, some of that, Im not saying itll be brand new, but I hope that the way I present it is helpful and novel. And maybe, you know, so that's kind of how I was thinking about it. Like different parts. Like for some people, hopefully the whole thing will be new and interesting, like kind of for the general reader. But then even for folks like you, I'm hoping there'll be parts. And that's, that's what you just said, is music to my ears. Thank you. That's exactly my goal."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I mean, I. So I fell in love with the Internet in the late nineties and have now spent my entire 25 year career working on the Internet. And I, you know, like, I was in an academic program at one point and actually philosophy PhD program and dropped out and did the Internet. And, like, I did that because I don't see myself as someone who necessarily would have gone into even business if it hadn't been for the Internet, to me, was this amazing thing. It was this idea that you'd link all the computers in the world and you would do it in a way where there was no intermediary, there was no company that controlled it. It was a community owned network. This is how the early Internet worked. This had to do. And I outlined a little bit in the book, but this had to do with the origins of it coming from academia and government. And there were a whole bunch of good things that happened that led to the nineties Internet being this open, democratically controlled system then that led to, as I argue in the book, because of the incentives it created, because it was open and there were no intermediaries, it created a very strong incentive for people to create websites and other kinds of Internet services. And that's why you had this golden period from the late nineties to the early two thousands where you had Facebook and YouTube and Amazon and Google and all these amazing Internet services that was created partly because of this. It was this open, democratic system where if you created a website, if you were Jeff Bezos or Larry Page and you created Google or Amazon, you owned it like it was your property. You didn't have anyone sitting in between you and your audience. They have a direct relationship with their audience. And then what happened in the sort of mid to late two thousands going up to this decade, rather the 2010s, you had the rise. You had a set of about roughly five companies that started sort of consolidate more and more control. And I rattle off some of these stats in the book, but the top 1% of social networks control 99% of the traffic, 99% of the revenue. Similar stats for search. The top five tech companies now account for 50% of the Nasdaq market capitalization, which is double doubled. Their share has doubled in the last decade. And so where I think we're potentially headed is for an Internet that looks a lot more like kind of old broadcast tv where you had ABC, CB's and NBC, and you have sort of three channels. And I think that's going to be a bad thing for the world. I think it's bad for society, I think it's bad for entrepreneurs, because it's much harder to kind of start a new company. I think it's bad for influencers and creators, because if you're a TikTok influencer or Instagram influencer, people go to those services to see the people who are on them, the other users. They don't go to see TikTok's content, they go to see other users. And yet those other users get very poor economics, as I walk through in detail in the book. So I think if a consolidated Internet around three to five companies, let's call it, is a bad thing for a whole bunch of reasons, by the way, it's a bad thing for venture capital. I mean, people ask me sometimes, like, is this some kind of altruistic message? Like, I work in the business that depends on startups existing, and that depends on having a dynamic, innovative, open Internet in many ways. So we see this at the firm as long term a very important precondition for having a vibrant startup ecosystem as having an open Internet look. I think all the trends are headed that way. Maybe you could slow it down with regulation. We've seen the FTC and others get more involved in blocking acquisitions and things. I see that as mostly a sideshow. It's not changing the core dynamics of companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon getting, and Google getting stronger and stronger. To me, blockchains offer one of the only credible counterweights to that consolidation and centralization movement. And specifically, blockchains allow you to create new Internet services that can be anything from social networks to games to financial services to you name it. And I have a bunch of chapters where I go through those specifically in the book. But you can create new Internet services that have a lot of the properties of the early Internet, where people can, software developers, creators, entrepreneurs, can build direct relationship with their audiences, where no intermediary is standing in the middle controlling things, where users and developers and creators and all the participants of the network are empowered both in terms of how the network is controlled, the digital service is controlled, but also how the economics work. I see blockchains as a new building material that allow us to create a new wave of digital services that have much better properties for the participants of the network and return us in many ways to what I see the intention of the Internet in the nineties and sort of the ideals of the Internet. I think blockchains can help return us to those ideals. And that's why I'm so excited about it, that's why I work on it. And I ask myself, this last downturn was brutal and all the bad things that happened. Look, I asked myself probably like a lot of people do, I believe in this. Is it worth it? And can I prove it to myself by writing it down in a book in detail? I came away, I think, with sort of reinvigorated and feeling like this is more important than ever. And I think things like artificial intelligence, I'm very pro AI, as I hope comes through in the book. I generally believe in technology has a positive influence, but I think AI will reinforce decentralizing forces. AI rewards companies with large stores of data and capital and compute. Meta just announced that they have 350,000 h. Think it is, it's 10 billion of GPU's. Now. Meta, to their credit, is making a lot of that open source, but you're going to see a lot of these companies, these big companies, get stronger and stronger with these AI systems. What is the counterbalancing force? We need something as a counterweight, and I believe the crypto blockchain movement is the main credible counterweight. Not only is it important, but I think it's an urgent thing that needs to be worked on right away. We need to specifically on the policy side, design policies that stop the bad stuff, of course, and put guardrails around it and avoid another FTX, but also allow for the productive use cases of blockchains, which is what I try to outline in the book."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, so, I mean, I think the first thing is, I mean, I guess I say a few. The way I describe it is a little bit different than most people in the industry. So first of all, I don't really like when people describe blockchains as ledgers, and it's not because they aren't ledgers, it's because they're more than ledgers. I think it understates the power of them. And I like to refer to them as computers. And by a computer, I'm going by the kind of original Alan Turing, his famous description in his undecidability paper, which is a state machine, which is something that both can store information and then act on that information. It has both kind of storage and programs that can modify that storage. That's what at its heart, what your Mac is, what an iPhone is, what a, you know, that is what a computer is, right? It's something that store information and then manipulate that information in some way. And blockchain, like Ethereum, is very much that. It's a computer. You can write code for it. It can store things. It's a computer that is owned by nobody and accessible to everybody, right? It's open, transparent. Contrary to a lot of the kind of fud you hear about blockchains being for hiding stuff, it's exactly the opposite of that. As I'm sure you know, Laura, they're actually horrible at hiding stuff. They're incredibly public. But to me, the key idea is that with any other type of computer, I can make promises to you. Like I can put up a server and I can say I'm going to create digital money on my website, on Chris's website. Or Google can put up a server and say they're going to have Google Coin or something like this, and they're going to put in some legal agreement or something else, some commitment that there'll only ever be 21 million coins, okay? In the end, because of the way those on a typical computer, in the end, they can just change their mind. They can just say, you know what? I'm going to make them 22 million coins. Or I'm going change my terms of service. Or you sign up for a social network and they have a privacy policy, they can just change their mind. Any digital service you use today is ultimately controlled by a person and a company, and then ultimately a person, the CEO of that company or the manager of that service, and they can just change whatever they want. Like, you know, the old saying is a cloud is just another word for someone else's computer. And it is like, you don't control these things, you have no rights. You know, all of the typical services you use on a daily basis, Instagram, TikTok, et cetera, in the end, whoever just runs those servers has the power. Blockchains invert that relationship between sort of who has the software and the hardware. So typically the hardware. Whoever controls the physical machine controls the software that runs on it. That's how corporate servers work. Blockchains invert that relationship. The software is in charge of the hardware. So I upload software to the Ethereum computer. Yes, there are people known as validators who run the physical code, but they can't, the way that blockchains are designed. The core design feature is those validators. Outside of extreme situations where you have what's called a 51% attack, outside of the situations, those validators can undermine the code. Whatever code is written will continue to run as designed in perpetuity. That means you can write code that makes commitments. You can write code that says, if this user owns this NFT, they get to fully control it in perpetuity. You can say, in this, you can do bitcoin. Bitcoin commits. There will only ever be 21 million coins. It doesn't matter. Ultimately, bitcoin runs on physical computers. In bitcoin's case, it's called miners bitcoin. The code is running on those computers, but the people running the code can't subvert the rules of the system. Outside of the extreme collusion, 51% attacks, in the normal course of events, they cannot subvert that. There are other rules, promises bitcoin makes. Bitcoin makes the promise that you can't double spend a bitcoin, right? That a single bitcoin can only be spent once. If you could double spend, it would lose its value. And so it makes all of these commitments that are preconditions for having a digital currency. And then something like Ethereum came along, right? And it generalized this and said, anyone can write code, and that code can also make commitments. And now we have entrepreneurs and independent developers who are exploring that design space and writing interesting code. That's where NFTs came from. NFTs have only been around the standards, only been formalized for four years. It was a new idea that, well, now that you can have fungible tokens, what about non fungible tokens? And that's very, very early in the development of NFTs, of people saying, well, what can you do with this? And you can have an NFT that represents avatar, like the kind of bored ape style, or you can have one that represents a piece of art, or you can have one that represents a sword in a video game, or you can have one that represents an identifier on a social media website, or you can have one that represents a deed, a physical, offline deed. It's a unit of encapsulation of ownership. But that unit of encapsulation of ownership could not exist. If you didn't have a computer that could make those strong commitments, right? Because if Google said you own this thing on Google servers, they could just change their mind. And they have, by the way, many, many times I have that in the book. They've had 300 something services that they've decided to shut down. They could just have Google Coin and just one day stop serving it. They can change their terms of service. Corporate commitments just can't believe to be relied on. They simply can't. They ultimately have a fiduciary duty. So I think of this blockchain as having this very powerful new feature through inverting the power relationship between software and hardware, putting the software in charge, then in turn enabling the ability to make these commitments about the future. And those commitments can span a range of areas. They can be financial commitments like as described in bitcoin. They can be commitments to software developers. So this is a thing that if you're not a software developer, you don't know. But there was a long period where social networks like Facebook and Twitter promised open API access to developers. This was like late two thousands and startups were built on them. And there was a whole wave of innovation, of people building on top of these things. And then they just all kind of whimsically, capriciously decided to remove or deprecate their APIs, killing off a whole cohort of startups. Blockchains, because you can make commitments. One of the commitments blockchains can make is to developers. They can say, hey, we're going to have open API access. And by the way, we can't change it. It's, we're committed. Therefore, you can build on solid ground, right? You're not building on quicksand, you're building your business on solid ground. Think about how important property rights are in the real world. Like if you, you know, the reason that I'm in New York right now, you know, that, that, that a small business, you know, will feel good about building, you know, their restaurant or, you know, kind of developing their restaurant on the street is the commitments around them. They know the sidewalk is open, they know the road is open. They have a legal agreement with their, you know, landlord or maybe they own it. And all of those commitments say, you know what? Now I feel good investing. There's lots and lots of data that from economists that show that countries where there's weaker property rights, there's less investment. That's because people don't have confidence that they can make long term commitments. This is a precondition for a lot of different kinds of entrepreneurship and development is giving people really strong property rights, and that's one way to think about what blockchains do."

So one thing that I did want to ask you about in the book, because obviously all these systems have coins. You use an analogy around faucets and sinks to describe tokenology, but I'm sure you're well aware, and this even came up in your earlier description of some of the criticisms of the web two space. But there are a lot of people in crypto who are critical of what they call VC coins. One of the memes around this actually uses an image of a faucet where the VC's get most of the flow. There's just drops left for retail. So with these critics calling out a sixteen's involvement in funding new projects and receiving some percentage of the tokens, how do you, you know, address those criticisms, especially when they say what you and the founders are doing is dumping on retail?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "It's just none of these criticisms I've seen are actually based on any facts. So like they're all just these sort of vague insinuations. The actual facts of the situation is, you know, if you look at all of the projects that were involved, first of all, the first thing people will say is that we own like too much and control these projects. It's just simply like, I think the average, certainly, I think the norm in the industry now is like a VC lead will own something like 3% of the tokens of, and if you just go, look, all this stuff is public information. Certainly almost all these, almost every project we're involved with, we own sub 5%. Second of all, I think even the smart critics will say that a 16 z holds these things for a very long time. The stat that we have is that of the token holdings since life to date, and the crypto funds, we have sold 6% of our token holdings. Just to give you a sense of the fact that how long term we are, look, theres a well known kind of thing in venture capital, whats called the j curve. The j curve is sort of, you start off a fund and then it sort of drops in value and then it goes up. And if youre successful, it takes a very long time. Our funds are structured like we dont have hedge funds in our crypto funds, we have venture funds. Venture funds mean that essentially its a different sort of economics where its a much more long term holding and our base period for our venture funds is ten years. And that base, meaning LP's just expect they won't get money back for ten years. And by the way, most, many of our funds are extended longer than that. So it's just not empirically true. I've never seen anyone make that claim with any data, and it doesn't match the data. And so I don't know, like, it's just not, I think this is just something people say to and like, maybe there are VC's out there who do that. And I don't know because some of this stuff, I don't have access to all the data for other people, but with respect to us, it's just simply not true."

And so at some point, and generally the way we look at it is we at some point, at different times, we'll do kind of strips of just selling a little bit of liquidity across different things."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, I mean, just to give you a quick history of venture capital, in the old days, put aside crypto, just old style. When I raised money for my first company in 2004, I think the norm in the VC industry, this is not crypto, obviously, 2004, I think VC's would often own 25% of a company and then fast forward again, not crypto. That number probably has just steadily declined to well below 15, if not 10%. This is in traditional venture capital, and that just has to do with dynamics of entrepreneurs. There's more capital out there. The entrepreneurs have more negotiating leverage in crypto. I think the numbers were already cut in half for a bunch of reasons. Look, part of the reason is that in any well designed blockchain project, theyre going to give at least 50% of the tokens to the community through various incentive programs, airdrops. Already the numbers are lower, then theres a lot of competition. Theres a lot of investors out there. That gives the entrepreneurs leverage that number. I'm basing this on anecdotes and not data, what I'm saying right now, but I'm pretty sure that number has cut in half the average ownership of a lead vc in a token project. And I'm pretty sure it's around. I mean, I know today 3% is a pretty decent number for a vc to get, and it's been steadily going down. I just don't think that, that, that criticism is based on data. I'd love to see people's data when they make that claim, because I haven't seen. It's not consistent with what I've been seeing, by the way. The other thing is, with these systems like Uniswap, I think Uniswap is one of our higher. That was an investment we made in, I think it was 2018 or 2019. We led the series a uniswap. I think that's one of our higher ownership of 6% or something. I don't actually know. I think it might something around there. But in all those cases, also, we have a delegate program where we commit to delegating half of our votes to our college students and other delegates that we have. So that's just another way to decentralize control and things. But look, I think the important thing I talk about this in the book is, let's compare this to the alternative. Which is? The alternative is you have these big companies who control most of the Internet, where it's controlled by one person or maybe a ten person board, and it's all opaque and it's all behind the scenes. So the idea that now having a community control with a few institutions owning 3% is somehow worse is just, to me, it's just losing perspective on the topic. Right. Which is a dramatic improvement in terms of making these systems more democratic and more community owned."

It's sort of a digital store of value. My goal here is to build a new wave of Internet services that replace a lot of the big Internet companies and do a lot of different things. And so I just view it as you need. We need to have more projects, doing more things. Um, and doing it, um, you know, in. In a way that is, it has proper funding, and sometimes that proper funding, like a useful way to raise that money is to have VC's involved. Like, it's just the reality. It's like, look, it'd be nice if, you know, you could build the next YouTube and Twitter and everything else in a totally bootstrap way. I've seen no evidence that's ever happened. It's literally never happened in 30 years. The Internet, I actually walked through all these examples of people trying to do it, and at some point, like, if it's not working over and over and over, and maybe you should try something else. And, like, venture capital, people like to criticize it and it's an easy punching bag. But the reality is, like, venture capital is the model that has created, you know, the vast majority of successful Internet services. Right? And so I, you know, at some point, I want, you know, I guess the question I would have is, do you want to start winning? Like, you know, like, I get, you know, like, is bitcoin winning against, you know, PayPal and Square cash and all these other services as a payment network? Is lightning winning? I think bitcoin is doing well as a digital gold store value. I think on the payment side it's still very early. We have some investments there, like Lightspark David Marcus, and I hope it does well. But ultimately, I view myself and our firm as pragmatists. We want these things to be successful. And there's sometimes in these things, there's a balance between having these ideals around fair launch and everything else, and winning."

And so just in that vein of talking about how to distribute the tokens, I noticed that when you describe blockchain networks, you did mention that one of the downsides of them could be plutocracy, in which big token holders have too much power. How do you think about designing governance and these systems so that crypto networks don't end up with that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. Yeah. So I have a chapter on network governance and I. It's interesting, I rewrote that chapter many times because I started off trying to, wanting to sort of give an answer to network governance, but then decided that, you know what? I just don't actually have an answer. What I do believe is that blockchains now allow network governance to be moved into the rich design space of software. You can now use software to design, design new governance systems. That's what a blockchain allows. And I think that is a notable improvement over just giving all the power to a CEO of Facebook or Twitter or in the case of things like web and email, where you have this, I think those are great, but you just haven't had any other community owned systems that have succeeded in the last 30 years. So to me, the idea that you can now design governance systems for networks, important breakthrough, the specific designs that are the best, I try to walk through some examples of what I think are some interesting ones that are. But the truth is, I don't like. I think it's still. I think it's still evolving. So. But to give you an example, like, I think originally we had sort of two broad schools of thought on blockchain network governance, right? One was the off chain governance of something like Ethereum, where it's done much more in this sort of old style open source governance, wherever essentially the software developers quote unquote vote by deciding what to upgrade to make. If you propose a fork or a change, this is how bitcoin works. The software developers are effectively voting by deciding which side of the fork to take. The other form of governance that we've seen initially is the fully on chain governance, and this is things like compound and uniswap. And then within. On chain governance, we've had strong. On chain governance, which is like compound, which would let you propose full code change, any arbitrary code change, you can propose it and people vote on it on chain through token votes. And then you have things like uniswap, which is much more constrained. You can't change the code, but you can vote on the funding. So it's also this question of what you can vote on. And then you have, I think, really interesting experiments like optimism, where you have a sort of bicameral system. So you have a kind of senate in house, if you will. And so the Senate kind of keeps check on the House. So people, that house is sort of the token votes, but you make sure they aren't doing things that are, for example, plutocratic and self interested. So you have this sort of override safety valve. I think thats a really promising experiment as an example thats going reasonably well. But I think these are complex problems. We have a guy, Andy hall, its a professor at Stanford, whos a governance political science expert who works on our team. And hes excited about this area because its this whole new kind of way to study governance. And look, what he would say is the reality is we havent figured out governance in the offline world. How is that going? You know, like, it's just complex. It's people, it's messy. But I do think, but I do will, the claim I would support, and I do argue in the book, is that it's a lot better than just having these kind of little dictatorships, which is what we have today with these social networks and other digital services, where just like, the person who runs it wakes up one day and decides to demote a certain type of post or a certain type of user, and, like, they have full power. I dont think thats a good way to control these systems, which have become Twitter, Facebook, PayPal, all of these digital services we use are now, they control global economics, politics, culture. These are very, very important systems. I think we backed into this system where theyre controlled by a few people who may or may not have society's broader interests in mind. And I don't think that's the right way to control digital services. And so I don't think blockchain, the blockchain space has figured out all the answers. But I do think it's a very interesting new set of tools to address these questions."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. So look, I'm, I talk about a little bit in the book. I think. I think time horizons are a very important thing. As I was just talking about the venture capital, like I, along with all of Silicon Valley, is in the for profit, you know, tech business, right. So there's no, no illusions about that. But generally, I think Silicon Valley works pretty well because its profit driven, but its long term profit driven. If you join a startup, you usually have to go through a five to ten year process and build something of value before you make money off of it. And the same with venture capital. I think people would be surprised at how long the average holding period in venture capital firms across the industry is. Like. It's, it's really long. Like the average, I think the average, I think it's longer than it's probably based on the data I've seen. But it's seven to eight years before a typical fund even breaks even, let alone makes profit. Right. Seven to eight years. And that's sort of just typical around the industry. And I think it's, look, it's, it's, it's, if you're doing it, I've know people that work at startups, it's like, oh gosh, you know, I'd like to go and have, buy a house and do all this stuff, and you, people have to wait. But it ends up aligning incentives very well between the company and the broader societal interests. Right. Because they just, you can't hype something up for eight years. Like you have to actually go build something useful. Right. And so I think that kind of stuff, look, and if you look at the, some of the draft proposals that came out of the House Financial services committee, like important ideas in there are enforced lockups. And I think I'm very supportive of those ideas. I think having, I think one of the main things that could be done to tamp down speculation would be longer time horizons enforced through policy. And so, for example, maybe users earn tokens through airdrops, but they can't sell them for some period of time or until some milestones are hit or some other kind of thing to severely dampen the speculative side of things. But I also think there's an interesting, sorry if one thing I could add is, I think there's also a lot of projects exploring what I would call financial dampening, which is, you've heard about points as an example, which are non transferable tokens. There's a bunch of people, I think in some ways one of the lessons is that from the speculative side of crypto? I call it the casino in the book from the casino side, which I think has hurt the space and given it a bad image and also hurt a lot of consumers. I think essentially that one of the key lessons is that there, in some ways, tokens are too powerful. The financial aspects just overwhelm everything else. You try to create a game and you want people to play the game, but everyone just ends up getting obsessed with the tokens. One of the things points do is it says, look, these are not as powerful. You're dampening it. You're saying, hey, these are just transferable points. Maybe someday they'll be non transferable or something else, but you're putting the focus back on the utility and not just on the financial aspects, because the financial aspects just overwhelms everything."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, well, this is one of these things where I think people are using the word, and I like, I think different people. Like, it's one of these, whenever you have new tech words, people use it in different ways and maybe not always in the same way. So I'm not even sure when people say points what they're referring to, because people can mean different things. I think that the idea of non transferability of tokens is interesting, especially just because there's a lot of legal uncertainty right now around these things. And so by making points tokens non transferable, it just makes it impossible for people to trade and to lose money and to have all those kinds of issues. And so I think that's one reason people are exploring it. And I think it's good to see people sort of running experiments and things, but it's still very early. I mean, even the word points is like, I think a month old or something. So we don't really know where all of it's headed."

And as we're all very well aware, that only happened because the SEC was forced to do it. And it probably should have happened sooner, or would have if bitcoin and crypto hadn't become politicized. I've even heard Gary Gensler actually talk about crypto and use the word casino to describe it. So I wondered what your thoughts were on why it is that crypto has become politicized. I don't know if you've seen that in previous eras of tech that you've worked on."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, it's a great question. I think there's different ways to look at it. One is just maybe the world is different now and everything is politicized. You saw this during COVID I remember when Covid started, I naively thought, ok, this will finally be an issue that brings the country together. And the fact that whether to wear a mask or not became a political issue, I think just says, probably says something about the current climate we live in. I think the fact that whether you have the crypto, I mean, I think that's one way to look at it. We kind of live in an era where for whatever reason, everything seems to become politicized. And that's happened with crypto. I think part of it is the origins, the fact that crypto started with bitcoin and started with a lot of them were libertarian, kind of coded, right. And that made people like Elizabeth Warren on the left and others sort of see it as, as the enemy. I, you know, I think that it's a blockchain is a software construction. It's politically neutral. And a lot of the use cases, I think, could be described as left. Some of them, a lot of them could be described as right in the same way that social media could be used in either direction. So I don't think, I think that they are, you know, it's very much politically neutral. And that, and it would be great to kind of, if we could lessen the politicization of it. I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly has happened. It is politicized and I think that's driving a lot of the policy now, unfortunately. But look, we're also seeing, I think a lot of moderate Democrats are much more open minded about it. I think it was six Democrats voted for the McHenry bill as an example. I think we'll see more of that. And I hope that as people, hopefully, if we can get the right messages out and help people understand the possibilities of the technology and sort of broaden the, make the movement more inclusive, bring more people into it, that potentially I hope that over time we can change that perception. Open source software is an interesting analog. Where it began as actually a left wing political movement from the eighties. It was sort of a socialist movement, anti copyright. And for a long time the nineties was sort of ignored as this fringe kind of left wing thing. And then it kind of morphed into a much more pragmatic movement with things like Linux. And so my hope is that that same thing can happen with blockchains. Is it sort of. Yes, it had these kind of political origins, but over time, people sort of view it more pragmatically as just another tool, another way to build things. So. But that obviously is not where we are today, and that would take time."

So I was curious for how either you or the firm view that investment now."

        "text": "Well, I'll speak for myself, which is I felt like I went through a journey where I was obviously a little bit part of web one, but then really part of web two and sort of the two thousands. I was an entrepreneur and then became an investor working on that. I became disillusioned with how that was going about when I got into 2013 or so, when I got into this space, into crypto, and that was around, as I document the book, when RSS and these other open social networking systems were failing or losing ground to these centralized systems like Facebook and look, and that was after like late two thousands, it looked like, well, Facebook will be a new platform and Twitter will be a new platform, but they'll be kind of, they'll uphold all the principles of the early Internet by 2013, that was clear that wasn't happening, right. And this was going to be a very different world, at least for myself. That's when I started to become disillusioned with this system and started to look for alternatives. And for me, that was sort of the striking thing about blockchains. And so I think people say that sometimes like, oh, it's hypocritical. You were part of the web, too. Mark Andreessen's involved in the face is still on the board of Facebook. I think generally, I think to me, it's consistent to have believed in something and supported it, and then to be, and then to, as you see it, going off the rails to support things that might fix it. And that's how I view my own journey. As I mentioned earlier, I just don't think there's going to be a huge. I just don't think venture capital is going to have a bright future if we don't have a dynamic Internet that's accessible and open to startups. Another very important issue that we're very involved with, it's not crypto is open source software in general open source Aihdenhe, which I think is the next policy threat. I mean, we already saw with the executive order from the Biden administration what looks like essentially effectively a ban on open source software through having to, quote, register frontier models and all these other kinds of things that just simply couldn't happen with open source software. And so I just think there's a bunch of forces that are effectively going to make the playing field, make it impossible to have a level playing field for startups. I don't think no one I know who was involved in the web two era up until 2013 had any idea this is where things would end up. So I think it's just been a big surprise. And some people seem happy with it. Other people, like me and others at my firm are not happy with how things ended up and want to try to improve it. But I think it surprised a lot of people for sure, because look, I mean, even the most optimistic, if you told the most optimistic tech person in 2007 that we'd have a social network that's worth whatever meta is worth now, $700 billion, they would have thought you were insane. If you told them that the five biggest companies, including Meta, were 50% of Nasdaq's market capitalization, they would have thought you were insane. Nobody predicted this level of consolidation that I know of. It just ended up very different than people thought it would. At least people I knew thought it would. Then that forces you to reckon with that. You either decide it's good or not good. I decide it's not good. And I want to work on systems that. That try to move things the other way."

There has been, you know, and like, look, with all of these companies that have other lines of business, like, it's one thing for a crypto company to get pressured from the government. But if you're Facebook and you've got, you know, these $150 billion of revenue streams from all these different businesses, and they're under various, I'm sure they're under thousands of various pressures and regulatory pressure. I think in the end, that was just the, the thing. I mean, that's also, if you remember that I forgot who it was. A senator sent a public letter to stripe, and I think it was PayPal and a bunch of other members of the consortium telling them they don't drop out, they're essentially going to threaten the rest of their business.

I think we need to have rules that are set and fair and protect consumers, but also allow for responsible innovation, which we don't have today. And that was one of the challenges Facebook had. It just simply weren't. We just didn't have that. There wasn't enough space there for them to innovate. And I think part of it, too, was the public messaging. If you look at a lot of the political discussion around it, it was like Facebook's trying to create their own money system. Of course they weren't. They were trying to create a payment system. It's very different than creating. They weren't trying to compete with the US dollar. And so it's just a lot of the messaging got complicated. So my takeaway, look, I think part of my takeaway is we're just not going to. We just need to have smart policy around all of these new tech issues, crypto, AI, everything else, if we're going to have the kind of innovation we want. A lot of it was just policy related. I don't know. I think they tried very hard. They did a good job. Look, a lot of the tech itself was all done and open on GitHub. The team spun out and did Aptos and Sui. And so the code lives on, I think, to Facebook's credit. And same with what they're doing with AI and llama. They were very open source oriented. So that's nice.

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I felt like. So I felt this. So if you remember that whole cycle, as I recall, maybe I'm forgetting the days, but I think it began in summer 2020 with the launch of the so called Defi Summer. And then that was, I think, when compound and Uniswap launched, or at least started to grow. And then we had top shot nfts toward the end of the year. And I felt like for that first year, I was really encouraged because it felt like there was a lot of product innovation and people were focused more on the products. It was like top shot was, hey, this is cool thing. You can collect these basketball cards. And then at some point, I don't remember the exact dates, but it was probably in 2021, it felt like, to me, it turned and it became, as you were describing earlier, less about the products and just all about the kind of money. And it just became. And the heroes on Twitter, crypto, Twitter, instead of them being product innovators, they were like three arrows and SPF. And so it not only became more about money, but the personalities became money personalities. And I felt like that. And then, of course, fast forward. And there were these disasters, and I think I forget the order, but it was like three arrows and Terra and of course, FTX. And so for me, I mean, I think the lessons are many fold, but one of them is, we look, we need regulation and we need clear regulation. So I'll just say I was on the board of Coinbase for years, and it was with great frustration at Coinbase that Coinbase has been, for example, had KYC since the beginning, contrary to some of the insinuations, otherwise, they've always been very, very compliant and spent a lot of money on regulation. Meanwhile, they had competitors who are offshore, including FTX, including Binance, who ignored a lot of those things. It was always very frustrating at Coinbase because they felt like they were doing all these things and complying and yet losing significant market share. I think at its peak, Binance, I dont know. You probably know better. I think Coinbase got down to 5% market share. All the market share was getting taken by FTX and Binance. I cant tell you how many times I heard from people in the venture community, oh, wow, FTX has got a new. Theyre so much better than Coinbase. You guys have the losing company. It was very frustrating, and I would argue, why is that? Because it takes seven years to build a case against binance. Because we don't have black and white rules around crypto, and therefore everything is going to court, like with the Coinbase case, and it's going to take five years to settle. And so we have this extremely slow moving system where there's going to be many, many long battles, when if you had just like a law passed and you had very clear rules, it would be black and white. And if somebody is outside of the lines, you can go enforce it immediately and you could shut this stuff down. So I think a lot of this was a policy thing, like having clear rules and then enforced rules that you dont have to go to court for five years over to enforce would help everybody. Okay. So I think that was part of the problem. I think part of the problem was, came from the crypto world. Im not saying so. Im not. I dont want to just, I don't want to take the responsibility off the crypto world, which is just this focus on trading and speculation and crypto, Twitter. I think the design of these systems, as I was mentioning earlier, there's just too much focus on money and tokens and not enough on utility and other kinds of things. So it was a series of failures, and it was a failure, and it was a disappointing outcome. I don't think that means that we should throw the baby out with the bathwater and give up on blockchains and tokens. I think that, as I've mentioned before, very, very important technology. The technology itself is not. Technology often arrives with various historical events and cultures and other kinds of things, but we need to separate that from the technology itself. That's what I try to do in my book. I try to look at the technology objectively. Here's what's good about it. Here's what's bad about it. If we had a proactive, smart policy, we try to maximize the good and minimize the bad. You can use a hammer to build a house or destroy a house. You can use nitrogen as fertilizer for explosives. All technology has a good side and a bad side. And the job of investors like me, of entrepreneurs, of policymakers, of society at large, is to think about systems for maximizing the good and minimizing the bad. Right. And I think that was probably the major lesson coming out of that, is like, we need to go collectively. I hope and figure that out. And by writing a book, what I'm hoping to do is take the debate out of kind of the Twitter dunking and ad hominem and all the things that go on of people name calling. And I'm trying to say, like, here's my view. I put it out in 230 pages in detail, if you want, if someone's going to critique it. My plan is if anyone does a good faith critique, like long form critique, I will respond to it in good faith. Like, I want to elevate the debate to, like, a smart discussion and not just like, people name calling. And I think, you know, I think this is, all of these tech policy things should be, you know, sort of new tech AI, too. Like, how does, how do we balance AI, which is clearly an amazing technology, and we should embrace with the livelihoods of creative people that it might replace? We need to have these discussions right. And we need to move these discussions out of this realm of, like, name calling and dunking. It needs to be, these need to be, like, serious, long form discussions, in my view, and I'm trying to contribute my part to it with the book."

It's not like it. I don't know, it's just, it's just not like we should be thinking about how do we use this technology to improve people's lives and improve the Internet and be inclusive. Like, if you're not, like, it's by definition, if you're exclusive, that's exclusive speech. Like, if you want to, if you want to grow the movement, you need to be inclusive."

        "text": "Yeah, so I don't know. Try not to. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the venture business, so we're long term, so we don't try to time markets or anything like that. But I think the good news is right now, infrastructure wise, we've made a lot of progress. It's always, for me, always slower than I'd like because I'm impatient about it. But the ethereum l two stuff is real, and I think we're getting very close. I measured against when will we have feature parity with web two systems where you can just go on, click a few buttons, not pay high gas fees or ideally any gas fees, and do something and just have it be a really clean user experience? I think we're very close to that. Some people have that today. I'll just give an example. Investment in a company called Blackbird that's doing restaurant related NFT stuff created by the founder of Eater.com and Resi, an experienced restaurant person. And it's a web two kind of like. It's like a very clean experience. And so I think we're seeing more and more of that. I think we're seeing more a whole bunch of. So I think on the infrastructure layer, things have gotten much, much better. There's also, of course, as I mentioned, alternative l one s like Aptos and Sui and Avalanche and Nir and a bunch of others. And I think the l two stuff has gone well, I think. And then on the application side, there's just a lot of really talented entrepreneurs. We've got a bunch of people making games and social networks. It's early, but I think, for example, Farcaster Dan Romero is a good example where I think it's a really interesting design of a decentralized social network on a blockchain. He's very early in terms of users, but he's got a nice early community going. And the technology is evolving well. And there's probably in our portfolio 20 to 30 applications like that, whether they be games or idea. I'm really excited about is this kind of collaborative storytelling, which is I talk about in the book, which is an idea that you can get a community of people together and they can create narrative universes like Harry Potter and Star wars and get rewarded financially for their contributions. There's just a whole series of interesting applications getting built. I was there for the early iPhone application wave, and what happened is you had a 13 year period of people trying to create smartphones. The iPhone came out in 2007. Smartphone innovation. Silicon Valley probably began 15 years before the iPhone. Like General Magic, there were a bunch of people trying to create smartphones in the two thousands. And then iPhone came out. It was finally like nailed the infrastructure, nailed the phone, and then there was like a year of like flashlight apps. And then about a year later, you started to see entrepreneurs entering. And I was actually an active investor at that point. And that's if you look at the data, like it was between 2009 and eleven. Like almost all the top apps were started, meaning Uber, Snap, Instagram, they were all that kind of, that range. And so at some point you hit this kind of like sweet spot in any kind of computing evolution. And I don't think we're there yet. We have not had our iPhone moment. I don't believe in crypto, but I do think that a lot of signs point to it being in the near future, I hope AI, by the way, I love this sort of new revisionist history that it was this overnight success. The first neural network paper was 1943. It was 80 years to chat GPT. There was a many, many summers and winters of AI. In fact, if you go read about it, there was a whole like AI investment, quote, bubble in the eighties, 1980s. I started an AI company in 2008. I thought that was the right time. I sold it to eBay in 2011. Retrospect, I was, whatever, over a decade too early. What ended up making AI happen? A lot of really smart people, algorithms, et cetera. But fundamentally it was GPU's got better and better, and GPU's got better because of video games. So I mean, I think that's AI is a great lesson both in how long these things can take, but also in how circuitous the roots can be. Sometimes video games led to AGI might be the headline 100 years from now or something. So my point just being like, that's how these things evolve. I don't think we've had our chat, GPT or iPhone moment yet. And I hope, and I also have found in my own career, it's easier to predict the direction of things and it's much harder to predict the timing. So I hesitate to give you timing predictions because I'll probably be wrong. But I do think that a lot of signs point to us being relatively, I'm hoping, relatively close to some kind of really breakthrough and more useful applications. And I think when that happens, that will really dramatically change the perception of the space because people will start to be able to directly experience one thing, to talk about these ideas, as you know, as I do in the book, but it's another thing to experience them. And I think that will be a really important moment when we finally have applications that. That hundreds of millions of people are using on a daily basis, and then they can understand that this is much more than just about casino speculation and they're really productive use cases."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. And I actually do want to ask you about a few different applications. But first, I have just a few quick questions about infrastructure related things. I'm sure you've heard this common debate in crypto now about modular versus monolithic blockchains. Obviously, this is ethereum versus Solana. And I wondered what your take was on that debate."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, so, by the way, that's an old debate in computing. So, like, this goes back to Unix versus Microsoft, right? Like Unix would be a modular system and Microsoft was a monolithic system. Our view has been. And, you know, like we, like, we're excited about Solana. And I think it's, you know, there's a lot of interesting positive signs there. And I think the technology is very interesting. You know, I guess I view it as different applications require different architectures and different sort of use cases. So, like, if you're building, you know, for example, one of the benefits of a monolithic architecture is you get is you have all the different applications built on that on Solana can fully interact with each other and be fully composable and be like Lego bricks. Whereas if you have a whole bunch of different l two s on Ethereum, maybe you have to need bridges and it's clumsier to get across. But at the same time, if you're building a video game and it's a more siloed experience and doesn't have to interact with other video games, and you just want it to be incredibly fast and cheap, you might want to build a l two, like an op stack fork on Ethereum, for example, if you're somebody else and you're building an NFT project that interacts with other applications or financial service that interacts with other financial services, the monolithic architecture might be preferable. So I view it as there's a trade off space and it depends on this is, by the way, the same is true in infrastructure software, not outside of crypto, is that you end up having different architectures, work for different applications. I see is the same thing here. I think it's great that we have so many strong technologists who are building the best monolithic and the best modular architecture and that those exist and are available for application developers to build on top. I think there can be multiple successful architectures. Ultimately, it's going to be driven by applications. I mean, the real thing now is we need those applications to get built out and grow. So that in turn helps develop these blockchains."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And if you were to pick which applications you thought would work better on which system, what would you say?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I think there's different trade offs. Modular. I mean, modular is better for atomic composability, like for just having services that interact with each other and call functions. And I'm getting a little bit technical, but like call functions, sort of synchronous function calls. And so if you have, I think, a lot of financial services, apps want that kind of stuff as an example, I think probably games work better in modular. I know I'm involved with a few games and they just, their model is free to play and they want to have 100 million people, many of whom aren't paying for it. They have to have incredibly low gas fees and incredibly low latency. And so they just want to roll their own chains and do it that way. So I think games might be one where you're going more modular as an example. So I don't know, I think we'll just have to see it play out. But I think it's good that we have a lot of application developers have."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "A lot of choices and restaking on. Ethereum is going to be rolled out this year with Eigen Layer. What do you think of Eigen layer and what impact do you think it'll have on Ethereum?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I think that. I think there's just so many. It's one of the most. There are many of these, but I think it's a very interesting intellectual, intellectually is a very interesting idea, and it's very important because it unlocks a bunch of new design possibilities, because you can do I just give you an example. One idea people have been talking about is how do you build distributed AI systems on top of blockchains? One of the challenges building a distributed AI system is you want to have a way to, like, if I go and say I send a job out to a bunch of computers to do some AI task, and they send me results, like how do I know they didn't send me back garbage? How do I validate what they did? And that was actually correct today, to do something like that, you'd have to build your own l one from scratch. You'd have to go build your own l one, and then think of what filecoin did or something like this. They had built their own l one, and then they have to go recruit a network of validators and those validators are going to then go and it's like starting from scratch. What's really interesting about restaking is that you don't have to start from scratch. You can write some code that says, here's my code for doing AI algorithmic validation, but I'm going to piggyback off of this existing infrastructure of the Ethereum validator community, which is this rich, diverse, decentralized community. It's a really interesting way to allow for many more sophisticated blockchain designs that don't have to start from scratch, because starting from scratch with a new community is just a very, very hard marketing problem. I don't know, it just shows you. I think it's another testament to when you have open permissionless systems anyone can build on. You just get all these cool new ideas. I think until Eigen layer, at least to my knowledge, no one had thought of that. It was just a brand new idea. Maybe there's some precursor to it that I don't know of. It just shows you when you have these open permissionless systems that you get all sorts of unexpected new breakthroughs, which is just sort of a broader testament to why we're believers in open innovation."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, honestly, it makes me think that we might see even more of a flourishing of an ecosystem on Ethereum. So in terms of applications, a lot of people see social fi as an area, right, for blockchain based apps to take off. What do you think of social fi apps? Or. Sorry, what do you think a social fi app would have to do differently to compete with existing social media platforms?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "You say social fi. You're referring to, like, friend tech, or are you referring to. Because I see it as, like, they're sort of. Is that what you mean, or do you mean."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, yeah, it could be just any sort of decentralized social network."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, well, so, I mean, because, like, we have, you know, so there's, to me, there's different types. There's ones that are kind of more finance oriented, like friend tech, and then there's ones that are less fine, that are more sort of like traditional social networks, like Farcaster. Yeah, I think that. I guess I'd say a couple of things. I think one very powerful force in technology is the power of software developers. I think that this is a point I try to show in my book. But open source software, I think, would surprise a lot of people is something on the order of high 90% of software in production in the world is open source software, which is software are created by ragtag communities on the Internet. Which is shocking that Linux is by far the dominant operating system in the world and there's no company behind it. People that are outside of technology are sometimes surprised to learn that the power of developers coming together and building stuff is a very, very powerful thing. Bill Joy, the co founder of Sun Microsystems, had a famous saying that no matter how many smart people work for you, most of the smart people don't work for you. Or I'm butchering a statement, but most of the smart people work for somebody else. Meaning it's always more powerful to get a developer movement to help you build something than it is to try to just get employees to help you build something. Right? We've seen this again and again through the history of technology. So I think one of the powerful things with blockchain based social networks, social fi as you're calling it, is this idea that you can build kind of a core protocol and an incentive system for developers to come and build on it and they can build out new clients and analytic tools and distribution tools and build a rich ecosystem around it. For those who are around doing Internet entrepreneurship in the 2007 to zero nine range, they'll remember there was this huge developer ecosystem on Twitter. There was a vc firm started to literally invest in Twitter startups. That's how big of an ecosystem it was. I think that if we can get that force going of you build these open public goods, these open protocols, and then we get lots of developers building on them in the way they do with open source software, you could have, I mean, why does open source software win in the end? It's not out of like, because people like, oh, I want to pick open source software to be a better person. It's because it's better software. Because when you get, you know, Linux is a better operating system than windows. It's more secure, you know, it's more modular, it is more reliable. Like, there's a whole bunch of reasons. It's better and it's better because it's open and the developers are better and it's a movement. And I think the same forces that have driven open source software that drove the open Internet that we've seen throughout the history of computing can also drive a new wave of social networks that are open and permissionless and community owned. And that's a very important force that I'm excited about. And projects like Farcaster are trying to lean into that and experiment with that."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, well, I think that in terms of go to market you're saying, yeah, I think that's an interesting question. A couple things. One is most social networks are two sided markets. Now im putting on my web two hat, by the way, im not my web three hat. So im giving you sort of best practice advice from the web two stuff. One is that most social networks are two sided markets. So you think about YouTube. You have the creators, you have the viewers and Twitter, you have the power influencers and you have the more passive readers. A lot of building a new social network is about getting those influential creator people either to switch or the new ones who pop up as they always are as the world evolves to join that network. Often that happens in weird niches. You think about Twitch and maybe it's some technical community. I think Farcaster is hoping to get a lot of the crypto community as example. They already have a lot of the ethereum community kind of grow out from there. And then as crypto grows, maybe grow with it and then maybe leapfrog into other adjacent areas of technology. I'm not speaking for Farcaster here, I'm just speculating on how one might do that. I think you have to look at this in the long arc of Internet history. Maybe it sounds hyperbolic to say it, but we're 30 years into the Internet and it seems like the Internet should be as important as one of the great inventions of all time. I think. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that. I think there's lots of room for in the long arc of history for new systems to develop. And when YouTube started, it was funny. I remember this 2005, they had competitors. The main competitors were these companies like Brightcove, which actually, funny enough, was Jeremy Allaire, who's now circle, and I'm not criticizing Brightcove, I was a fan of theirs, but there were sort of these competitors who were taking CB's and NFL content and putting on the Internet. And YouTube said, you know what, we're just going to make a website where anyone can upload content. And so they were basically making a bet that there would be a new wave of people that come on the Internet that aren't popular today. They become popular through social video. And of course they ended up being right. And today you have YouTube influencers who have more followers than the NFL and CBI or whatever. I mean, it's just massively popular. That didn't exist at the time. So I think that's the other thing to think about with these new technology movements is that a lot of times the sort of the audience and the creators and all the users will be, many of them will be just people who are only now coming onto the Internet or only now becoming influential on the Internet. Right. I mean, you're trying to build these things for the long term and for future people and future ways of growth."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "All right, so I know we're running along, but I have just two last questions. There's been a battle waged in the crypto community over creator royalties in the last couple of years, and creators have kind of largely lost that battle, with royalties not being supported when they were originally touted as a way for them yet to solve a problem. So I was wondering what your thought was on how those should be handled."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I think creator royalties are very important, and I think that there are various. So I think that. And they were like, they were important part of why NFTs appeal to creators. And so I think of it as sort of non negotiable. We need to figure out the right way to bring them back. There are technical nuances. So, for example, if you enforce everything on chain, it makes it hard for a user to move between one of their own walls to another. And we actually, we have a research team now led by Tim Roughgarden. He's a professor at Columbia. And actually, one of the. Our team has. A number of members of our team have been working on this problem and plan to publish. Everything they do is open source, and they'll just publish it and won't be, you know, it'll just going to be sort of a public good. And so we're working on a bunch of stuff there. So I think it's. To me, it's kind of annoying that this became an issue. It feels like an own goal by the crypto community, like, scoring on itself here that, like, this. I don't know. Like, I don't know why. It's unfortunate to me that people decided to build systems that fork around creator royalties, but I think that there are ways to bring them back, and I think they will be brought back, and I think they're essential. I don't think it's. I think that people that are trying to work around them are being short sighted because it's long term. The only way to really grow the NFT movement is going to be to ensure that creators are paid royalties. By the way. It may not be the optimal system is per trade. It may be other systems. There's other proposals, like where you do it with other kind of systems that maybe encourage different behaviors, but there needs to be a recurring revenue stream to creators, because that's really, to me, one of the fundamental new promises of web three is that, unlike web two, creators will get paid properly. I see that as non negotiable."

What downsides do you think will become apparent over time?"

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, I think, and, you know, I tried to be open minded about this in my book. Like, so, in the book, I deliberately bring in what I think of as the smartest objections. So as an example, in the take rate section, I bring in moxie. Marlonspike had this critique of systems like Opensea and just generally blockchain based systems, and saying, essentially, there was a risk of what he called recentralization, I think, which is essentially, you start off decentralized, and it's all these great things, but then over time, people will end up aggregating around decentralized hubs. And so I tried to kind of steel man in the book the best objections, including his, and I think, I'd like to think, I hope I did characterize his argument in a fair way. And I say in the book, instead of saying he's wrong, I said, that's a really good objection, but I think that there are design lessons that we can take away from it. And if you design these systems correctly, you can eliminate or mitigate those risks. So I don't think it's a fatal objection, but I think it's a very forward looking one that leads us to design lessons. And I think I did this throughout the book, where it's sort of, here are the like with governance. I don't say this is a panacea. This is rah rah. This is some beautiful utopia. I just think this is an important new tool that we can now explore this. And here are some of the interesting directions we can go. And here are some of the risks, by the way, with tokens and financial centers. I have a lot of sections of the book talking about the risks of it, saying that we don't want. You know, I have a whole section on regulation. I, you know, it's not, I'm not, I'm not it by any. I'm arguing for smart regulation, just to be clear. So I, I try to take kind of a balanced view on it. And I do think, look, I think a lot of this stuff can be, if you think it through ahead of time and you design the systems in a smart way with those risks in mind, you can do a lot to mitigate them. And we now have, look, we have a lot more history of the Internet now than we ever did. Like when we started the web, two thing, it was, you know, ten years of history. We have 30 years of history. We've seen a lot of experiments, and I think we can learn a lot from that. So I think really the question is, do we want to like, to me, we have enough history, we have enough ideas, we have enough tools. The really big question is, are we going to get together, we, the world, the community, the policymakers, and actually have a constructive conversation about how do we enable responsible innovation and how do we design better systems, or are we going to just sort of have a food fight and throw stuff at each other? And I'm hoping that we can do the former. And that's what I'm trying to do small part of with my book."
