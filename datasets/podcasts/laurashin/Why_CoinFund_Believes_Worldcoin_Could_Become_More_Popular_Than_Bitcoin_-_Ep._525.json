        "text": "I definitely think that throughout 22 and into 23. The fundraising environment for institutional investors who are looking at crypto managers has been extremely challenging. Right. So in the beginning of the year, you had the crash of Luna and BlockFi and three ac, you had kind of a bear market throughout the year with public market prices dropping, and eventually, toward the end of the year, private market prices catching up and dropping as well. And then, of course, in November, you had this catastrophic FTX scenario that we all live through as an industry. And what Chris and I are so proud of on behalf of our team is that throughout that period, we managed to raise about $550 million. This is really a testament to, first of all, the professionalization that coin fund has been going through over the last couple of years. A testament to our IR team who has built institutional relationships over the last number of years that led up to being able to engage larger institutions this way and close them, and also a little bit of the strategy of what products we are kind of offering and how we're offering them. So we're extremely proud of to be well capitalized and really bullish on crypto, even though the market right now is somewhat uncertain, somewhat sideways, a lot of the regulation. Laura, as you know very well, it is being figured out in real time, but we are more aligned than ever to support and champion our portfolio companies. What do you think, Chris?"

If you look at our previous vintage seed three, that was $83 million million dollars. And with this raise, we actually approached our caps. You don't want to have a humongous pre seed seed fund where you're asset gathering. So we like to stay precise in our investments. And yeah, we calibrate it right to the cap. So very, very proud of the team.

And when FTX happened, that was really, that really took the cake. I think a lot of institutional investors just stopped writing checks at this point. We've definitely had some relationships that were tracking, but then upon that event happening, took a significant step back. And, Laura, FTX was a debacle, but even something as simple as this Coinbase lawsuit between them in the SEC this year, which actually I see is almost like a bullish thing for the industry, that event alone also has tempered some investment at the present time."

I think it's pretty clear that the industry is maturing, and the companies that are able to navigate the stress that we've experienced, they built really strong foundations and they're emerging out of this much stronger. I do agree with Jake that the Coinbase case is ultimately going to be resulting in a net positive for the industry, because we're marching on a road path to clarity. No matter what. People like Coinfund, we've always been supportive of regulation. We've been supportive of principles based regulation. And what we're seeing now is that, look, massive amount of things happening in Congress right now. There are some major questions. There are some major questions on how this should be regulated. Coinbase makes that case very clear. And either way, whether we go through the courts, whether we go through what we prefer, frankly, which is the legislative outcome, we're going to get some clarity. We're hopeful that it's principled and nuanced, but all we want to do is to take this black cloud away from our entrepreneurs and allow them to do what they do best, which is build. And so whether it takes a couple of years and we get that clarity in the court, or if our Congress jumps into action. By the way, great episode with Congressman Torres yesterday. I thought he articulated it very thoughtfully."

Like this post. 22 post. Yeah, 22 post. FTX is definitely a sort of unusual time in crypto. So just when you look at the long arc of crypto development, where would you say the industry and the technology are right now in terms of adoption? And then when you think about that, how does that influence how youll be deploying these funds youve just raised?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, thanks, Laura. I remember mining ethereum in 2015 and thinking like, oh, man. Well, were just starting the network now, but in 2016 we're going to have so many apps going to market, and now our estimate is more like 2026. So there's like a ten year delay there between truly going to market. But I think what we've seen is definitely that there has become a lot more consumer technology that founders are building and more sophisticated founders that have come in, especially over the last two, two and a half years, from web two. To build some of these go to markets and examples of that in our portfolio, and I would say we probably invest in like ten to 20% of our portfolios, is looking at kind of consumer, but mostly that's been gaming related to nfTs. It's been sort of SaaS software, such as kind of analytics platforms that surface blockchain data. And probably also a couple of go to markets that are trying to bring DeFi or nfTs, those kind of core value propositions to the market in a way that, like normal people can use them, and of course, onboarding tools as well. So I would say there's definitely been an increase in sort of consumer focus in the space. But have we seen this incredible killer app that everybody wants to use? I don't think we've seen that. And I invite us to think about, like, I tweeted this the other day, like, think about chat GPT. This is an application that has some very interesting properties. Number one, you can use it in a second. Number two, you could explain the value proposition in a second. And number three, everybody wants to try it, right? Like it's AI, it's like the new cool thing I would offer that we don't have any web three app that has those three properties at the same time. We've made apps that are easy to onboard onto, and we might have even made apps that people want to try, but we really need all three of those things to create that kind of growth. What do I think those apps might be in the future? Well, I think, Laura, honestly, it's probably the things that we always suspected all along. I think we can create, and Brian Armstrong tweeted about this the other day, very, very cheap payments globally using blockchains. And that should be something that everybody wants to use, because moving money these days is not exactly cheap. It's expensive relative to the state of our technology. The other big use case that I've been thinking about, especially this week as one of our portfolio companies, Worldcoin, has launched officially and globally on Monday, is this idea of just global, decentralized identity, of which Worldcoin, I think could be a really interesting foundation. And so there's a lot of initiatives on that side of the space, and there's a lot of applications like global Ubi that could be incredibly impactful for the world. So I think both of those areas are kind of what we've always talked about in crypto as being very disruptive and they're actually starting to come to market now."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And I do want to ask you, of course, a ton about world coin, but I do want to just quickly ask you also, I mean, the ability to do cheap blockchain payments has been around since 2009, so why is it that you think I, that use case still hasn't taken off?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "I was going to just jump on what you said, Jake, and I think, I love the way you talked about foundational infrastructure building. Now, next phase is going to be applications. But this is related to your question, Laura. Institutional adoption is another major theme that I think we're going to see in the next cycle and people have been debating it. Oh, the institutions are here. Oh, they're coming or they're never coming. But what's happening now is during the bear cycle, the institutions have their teams, their blockchain. Sometimes it's a DLT team. During bull markets, the light bulb would go on and they jump over to the crypto space because they realized what was happening. I think during the bear, the institutions were building as well. And now these teams have stayed together. So we're starting to see more outputs from there. I sit on the CFTC's global markets advisory committee and we met a couple of weeks ago. Half the day was focused on tokenization and this whole influx of tokenization that we're going to see. Stablecoins, in my mind, are the first real use case that's a cheap product market fit for payments. What we think is going to happen is that you're going to see additional focus on stable coins. And look, we just had a bill that came out of committee yesterday. As you get more regulatory clarity, then you'll see greater institutional adoption, which I think will then facilitate more adoption. The tokenized FX markets are fascinating. FX trades $7.5 trillion a day and to date we only really have USD stablecoins. I think 99.5% of stablecoins are dollars. And so that's another theme that I think will also allow for payments as additional regulation crystallizes. And this tokenization theme really takes hold."

Which totally makes sense because, you know, everyday people in non us dollar economies, if they want to transact, even if it is an american sending them money, they will want to receive it in euros or whatever their local currency is. So. All right, so let's chat about Worldcoin. Obviously, this is what everybody's been talking about this week, and I'm sure you're well aware Worldcoin has faced quite a bit of criticism from the community. Before we dive into all that, you started to talk a little bit about this, but why don't you fill in more about what it was about Worldcoin, or this problem that you saw with proof of personhood that made you decide that this was the project you were going to invest in?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Absolutely. So I believe it was in 2020 that we were really attracted to Worldcoin's large global vision and really web three focused technology and kind of intuitively values. At the end of the day, Laura, I think worldcoin solves just an absolutely key problem in decentralization technology. That problem is, of course, civil resistance, or in plain language, being able to assign to one address the certification that that address belongs to a single human. And just to take us through a few use cases of what that implies, I. Well, first of all, it has profound implications for decentralized governance and voting systems. Most voting systems in blockchain have been token weighted systems. They've been plutocratic, they've not always been fair. They've been kind of compromised by whales at times. And having a proof of humanity will guarantee a one person, one vote voting systems. You'll enable systems that are very, very democratic. You can create. One of the central ideas of worldcoin is that if you can create a distribution of a digital asset that's extremely wide, you can basically build a cryptocurrency that's bigger and more valuable than bitcoin. Because we believe, at the end of the day, bitcoin holds its value because of global consensus around the fact that it is a kind of digital gold commodity kind of asset. With worldcoin, we think we can, and we wrote, our analyst Austin Barrick wrote about this in our thesis that we published in our blog. At some point, we can get to a billion users, we think, in world coin, and that would probably make it more widely distributed than bitcoin. Using this platform, you could create things like fair token distributions, fair airdrops. I think it's a very interesting basis for reputation systems and identity in general. Identity can't really be one thing. It's got to be segmented across many different areas, but it's really interesting to have one digital basis in those segmented identities. That is a public good that lives on a decentralized network. One kind of pet use case that I love to think about is, guys, it's actually not that hard to solve the bot problem on Twitter or X.com, as it's called these days. All you got to do is you have to verify that the users are humans, and that's the technology that worldcoin offers. And finally, there's a reason why Sam Altman is actually kind of the originator of the world coin idea coming from, you know, his work at OpenAI and in the AI world. And he hasn't said exactly, you know, specifically what he, what he sees the intersection there to be. But I can tell you what I think, which is that I believe Sam is thinking about world Coin ids as a way to govern AI in a democratic manner over the long term. And that's an incredibly futuristic and interesting use case. So for all of those reasons, we just thought, and the fact that the team is absolutely first class and fantastic and has built a technological device that is an absolutely new technology in the world, these are all the reasons why we think this is going to be a huge success."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And just to draw out what you were saying there, you were referring to how when you talked about using world coin to govern an AI, you were talking about this concept people have been discussing a lot, which is like using a dao to govern the development of these AI's. Is that what you're saying?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Absolutely, yeah. And that could mean governance over the data sets that are being used to train the AI's. Like giving people the ability to opt in or opt out with their content, or whether it's being used. It could mean trust and safety issues around AI. Like what kind of. Like what are the limitations of a. Of a public AI that. That want to be observed in a particular situation? Maybe it's in a kindergarten, maybe it's in a, in a government building. Maybe it's a public one, maybe it's a private one. But all those things need, you know, custom governance, depending on the context that they're in. And the thing that really excites me about kind of decentralized governance in general, Laura, is just that we're going to have a new class of public goods that we're going to be able to democratically govern, and those goods will be provided by blockchains, not by governments. That's the really disruptive thing here."

There's a UK regulator that's issued a warning when you say they have a focus on privacy. A lot of people really are concerned about the fact that Worldcoin is getting not only just certain people, but kind of vulnerable populations. These people in developing countries where they're not from even a wealthy part of the developing country, they're from a place where a financial incentive could get them to do something that, and I'm not saying that this is worldcoin, but just generally a financial incentive could get them to do things that maybe are not in their best interest otherwise. And so I wondered what your response is to these critics who are questioning why it is that world point. Yeah. Has been getting people to give them their biometric data for money."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, listen, Laura, I'm so glad you asked this. This is obviously like a huge issue that a lot of people have brought up, and it's a big topic. And so I want to try to address as much of this as I can. One thing to say is, like one of the best articles to read on this is actually Vitalik Buterin's most recent article, which is called what do I really think about biometric proof of personhood? And in that article, he does this incredibly scientific and thoughtful and dispassionate analysis of all the different proof of personhood systems that existed. And if you read the article, the conclusion that he actually comes to is that among the different solutions, biometric based proof of personhood is actually the most privacy preserving solutions, assuming that it's architected that way. Right. And to me, while we should be asking those questions and having those concerns, there's also a reality around how worldcoin is actually implemented, actually architected. And I can tell you that if you look at those facts, it is going to be one of the most privacy preserving and web three values compatible proof of personhood systems that are out there. Now, Vitalik is also eyes wide open that there are centralization risks here. There's, for example, proprietary hardware, and that's currently being manufactured by kind of a more centralized organization. But one of the mitigants to that is that the Worldcoin team have committed essentially to open sourcing everything that they're doing. They're going through a process of progressive decentralization of the network, of the protocol, and eventually of the hardware as well, which is a huge challenge. We're very eyes wide open that like, almost nobody has done that before. And there's a variety of issues to solve there. But on a practical level, when you use this device, your biometric data is not stored and is not sent somewhere. It does not leave the device, it gets erased. The only thing that leaves the device is a hash, the iris code. Now what's so interesting is that when you actually go to pay with your world coin wallet and you want to provide a proof of unique personhood, you're not even actually sending the public key of your world id, the one that's generated from your IR's code. You're sending a zero knowledge proof of the fact that you have a world id, and it's in that set of unique humans, but you're not even saying, like, which one. And so if you start to look at the actual reality of privacy and worldcoin, you start to realize this is the most web three compatible proof of personhood that's really out there. Because the next thing of similar strength is kind of like AMl KyC that you do with a proof of authority. And then on kind of the go to market to. I know that worldcoin spent a few years going out to developing countries as a go to market, and some people have raised issues with that. I mean, my position on that is of course, like, we deeply care about the fact that we don't want those types of strategies to be abused, and there's always going to be people attacking the system. So world point is constantly evaluating those strategies. I think on this particular point, Laura, of having someone predatory kind of take someone's world id, I think there's actually technological solutions to them. And again, Vitalik writes about this in his post. And the basic solution is, I think in the future, world coin hardware will be very widely available. And if I sell you my world id, let's say I will be able to then go to a world coin device, rescan, create and create a new world id, invalidating the first one, the credibility of being able to sell for a profit to third parties. These ids, I think will go to zero. I don't think people will buy them."

But still, they're having their personal biometric data scanned in a way that they don't know much about. World coin. What if it gets hacked? What if their biometric data gets out there?

But if we are not able to deploy the infrastructure for this and run those experiments, make those learnings and create better systems, then I don't know how else we can, you know, we can make these impactful changes."

Distribution of the world coin token, which is as far as I understand. I think I did the math right on this. There's about 5% that was issued, and if you look at the amount issued versus the fully diluted value, it's just really insanely skewed. How or why did the world Coin team, and I don't know how much you guys were involved, but I wondered how you guys came up with that model and why you felt that that was the right way to launch."

The intention of Worldcoin is to become, as I said previously, one of the widest distributed digital assets. What you're referring to is the issue of a smaller float that I think starts to become resolved as more and more people enter the system. There are some people have argued that. I think there was someone who argued that a 20% holdback was incredibly large. I actually disagree with that. Over 105 venture portfolio companies and I know what the averages are in terms of holding back digital assets for investors, and I can tell you that 20% is very, very average. There are definitely companies that have had less. I think live peer had a 10% or so team hold back. There are companies that had significantly more, like over 50% hold back. I don't think 20% is, you know, is kind of as tough as some people are saying."

I know, as you said, you guys weren't directly involved in that. So you are about to launch what you're calling CESR, the composite ether staking rate. And you're doing this in conjunction with coindesk indices. Explain what that staking rate is, why having a benchmark staking rate is important, and what you think will be built using that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Thank you so much for the question. So Cesr, we call it Caesar. If you think about finance, global finance. Interest rates form the backbone. They form the cornerstone of global finance. You think about legacy rates, things like Libor, now, sofa or fed funds, there are trillions and trillions of dollars of financial products that are built on top of these cornerstone rates. If you look at Libor, there were some problems with it. It was very much like web two was centrally controlled, it was manipulated, and it was designed rather poorly. But what happened was, when we looked at Ethereum, and this goes back to last year, August, as it transitioned from proof of work to proof of stake, we had this epiphany, and we're like, oh, my gosh, the risk free rate for Ethereum was just born. How do you think about that? You look at the 700 plus thousand validators, and if you look at the returns that they receive every single day and you annualize it, that's your risk free. We don't like to say risk free rate, but that's your benchmark rate for Ethereum, right? And there's two components to it. There is the emissions, the inflationary emissions that come out, and then all of those transaction fees. And so we came up with this concept and then we started watching it, and it was fascinating why? Because when FTX happened, people freaked out. We had this issue with counterparty risk. They moved all their, many of their assets on chain, and we saw Caesar spike because those transaction fees went up. We saw another instance of it spiking with SVB, with Silicon Valley bank. Again, counterparty risk concerns. People are like, oh my gosh, I got to protect my assets. I got to move them on chain. Caesar spiked. But the largest observation that we've had was during Pepe, when there was so much trading activity, transaction fees went up and it spiked. Now, what do you do with this thing? Why is it so important? There are really two different applications and ways that you can utilize it. And utility is always something that we think about first as a benchmark. Think about how many loans in traditional finance reference liborous. Over time, we're going to think we expect for a forward curve to be created and that will allow us to calculate future value, present value, a discount curve that allows us to inform valuations of things denominated in Ethereum, things like nfts. You have all these different benchmark capabilities if you're a professional staker, and I spoke to many of them, they're excited. Wouldn't it be great to have a benchmark upon what you perform? That's cool, is all the benchmarking that you can use it for. But what gets us really excited is around risk transfer. I come from the derivative space. I come from the future space. Markets are born when you have hedgers and speculators. And we think, and we're already working with a number of different industry participants on helping them launch a swap product. There are very few fixed rates in crypto. And what we're able to do now, if you're a staker and you swap the floating rate, and I talked about some of the volatility of the rate. If you're able to swap that for a fixed rate, you can run a much more stable business because you know your income. And again, like in traditional finance, that's a $500 trillion industry. The other thing about it is that it's global, right? We don't have different rates for different countries. I think over time it's going to compete with traditional rates and you're going to see it being able to form like things. We have these things called basis swaps in traditional finance, which is a floating for floating. So it'll also be an onboarding capability. But bottom line is that this, we hope, unlocks next generation financial products across Ethereum and beyond. It's a huge unlock if we build social consensus and people use it as a benchmark, because anytime you standardize something, it can explode. I mean, look at containerized shipping is something I often talk about. I'm an old naval guy, so it's super excited. Last thing I'll tell you is that it's very, very interesting and accessible to traditional finance. Why they really struggle with crypto. And we can talk about all the regulatory capital things. Putting crypto on balance sheet is like impossible for them. But they know rates, they love rates. And we think that this is very accessible. They're very interested in ethereum yield when you have a synthetic rate like this, again, as that forward curve evolves. Super, super interesting. So we're really excited about coindesk indices, our partner, and hopefully you're going to hear a lot more from this in the future."

And when we were chatting before this, someone on your team said, AI is everywhere, but we believe AI needs crypto. Crypto doesn't need AI. Talk a little bit about that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, I think I mostly agree with that. I actually do think we can go in either direction. But one of the reasons I think crypto is most applicable to AI is because AI Laura, has a huge trust problem these days. Crypto approaches to AI weren't very popular a year, year and a half ago. In fact, AI people would look at things doing like decentralized AI model training and say, this is crazy. Why would we ever want to do this? We actually need all the compute we can get to get the model as large as we can. If we decentralize this, this is slowing us down. But what has happened since then is, I think AI has made a huge splash in the public consciousness. GPT-3 came out. GPT four came out. Chad. GPT came out. Stability AI launched stable diffusion to compete with for generative image. AI's with Dolly two. And people have gotten their hands on AI and are starting to really acquiesce the fact that companies that are centralized and have proprietary models are really in a position to suck up a lot of data from users, maybe even more data than Google has on us at the end of the day. And I think this privacy and trust problem is starting to enter more into the public consciousness. That's one issue. And then the other issue is look at where all of the innovation in AI is actually happening. There's a broader view, not just in web three and crypto, but in the AI space as a whole, that most of the innovation is actually going to happen in open source. And we've seen, again, upon stable diffusion coming out, just the explosion of different people experimenting with these things, creating new models, training, fine tuning models. The progress has been absolutely astounding. Laura. Like the time, if you rewind, like four years, like the time from when you had a proprietary model to an equivalent open source model was probably years. The time between Dali two and stable diffusion 1.4 was like six, seven months. And now that is compressing even further. And so when I think about web three and AI, what I think web three can do for AI is open up the pipeline that creates these models. And that pipeline starts with data, with talent. A lot of compute in order to train the models, a lot of compute in order to serve the models as APIs, and then eventually commercialization and productization. Now, what we've seen as a wearing our investor hat is that most of the really foundational web three AI intersection is currently happening in this compute area. Compute is the bottleneck for just about everything in AI. If you look at the open AI roadmap, almost like every roadmap item is bottlenecked by the availability of GPU's. And commercialization is extremely bottlenecked by the availability of models, which is why we're seeing this insane proliferation of open models, open large language models like GPT for all. Even Facebook recently released an open source model called Lama two that's gotten everybody very excited. And so where we have been investing is in this idea of decentralized training, where people can come together and create models that are, you know, maybe as big as a GPT by crowdfunding them and making them open and available. And then also inference for smart contracts we let around a company called Giza recently, Giza Tech XYz. And what Giza does is it makes the outputs of AI models available to smart contracts. And so that really opens up the design space of what smart contracts can do. So you can do things like facial recognition or text recognition in a smart contract and automate a lot of those aspects."

        "text": "I had breakfast yesterday with a very senior government official from the UK. And when I run around the world, I have regulators and senior government officials banging their hand on the table, saying, please come to my country. Build. We're going to differentiate with very thoughtful, nuanced principles based regulation. And that was the exact message out of the UK. What we've been lacking in the US is just that we haven't been looking forward. We haven't been coming up with policies that focus on the technology and actually enable it and empower it and keep us in the lead. Right? And so, look, this bill, it's not perfect, but something pretty amazing happened yesterday. And we had, the first time that we had legislation unique to crypto advancing out of a committee. There's a long way to go, right? But like I said, the fact that a number of congresspeople on both sides of the aisle supported it is a really important data point. And again, as you start unpacking what makes those folks unique, and you start really looking at that generational divide that's happening it really makes you encouraged for the longer term. And so what will this bill do? It will give us clarity. And I think it feeds really nicely into some of the work we're doing right now with the CFTC. But at the end of the day, what should be regulated by the CFTC and what should be regulated by the SEC, it helps provide some clarity and it also opens up the concept of a digital asset or a cryptocurrency moving between those agencies as its level of decentralization changes. And so I would love, love, love to get to a point where we had empirical measures around those measures of decentralization so that it can be obvious, like, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be a surprise. We need to give our entrepreneurs predictable, transparent ways to operate, and that allows us to, when we invest in companies, we don't want them to spend a good portion of that investment on legal counsel. That's going to come back and tell them, well, we're not really sure we wanted to take those dollars and invest in people, invest in technology and invest in their business. And so long way of saying, I'm hopeful that this bill, and again, it's an iterative process, XRP gave us some clarity. XRP gave us. I think it's galvanizing Congress to take a little bit more action because some of the results of what I guess we're calling the Torres doctrine counterintuitive. Right. And so now Congress is saying, well, wait a second, we need to do something, and we're very pleased that they're doing something, and we're looking forward to these elections to see how that further progresses us."

And then ultimately the administration, and the administration seems to have some very strong thoughts on things like stable coins as well. So right now, I think what we want to do is work with policymakers just, just on that clarity point. How can we make sure that our entrepreneurs understand how an individual asset is regulated. What are the rules? And we'll continue to work with a number of different folks to make sure that our voice is heard."

Exactly, of the House Financial Services committee. And then the ranking member, Maxine Waters, to be on the same page about the stablecoin bill. So that didn't happen. What does that mean for the stablecoin bill? How far do you think it'll go at this point? What do you think is good about it? What's not? Give us your take."

To me, stablecoins are the most incredible opportunity for our country to get right. When you look at the ways, it's an obvious use case in utility. We can deliver efficiency to our companies, we can save costs the way that you can reduce remittances by 80%, according to Uniswap. The fact is there are incredible national security opportunities for the United States to get stable coins. Right? So when you look at all of those things, it's like, astounding that we haven't been on the front foot and we haven't really tried to create the conditions so that the us dollar retains and maybe even increases its reserve status. Like, that's probably what the us government wants, but we have not been on our front foot. I think it was disappointing that after 15 months that we weren't able to, I guess, generate more bipartisan support. But again, when you look at how people voted, it was more along generational lines rather than partisan lines in many cases. And so does this bill have legs? There are some open questions about it. Like, for example, should states have the opportunity to license stable coins? Well, gosh, that's probably a much bigger subject around states rights. I personally believe that we'll probably end up in a good place. Look, there's going to be a lot more sausage making. That happens. The process is not a, it's not a clean one. It was designed that way by purpose, by our founders. At the end of the day, we're going to get stable coin legislation. I can't tell you when it's going to happen, but it's going to happen. And when it does, hopefully it'll be in a principled place. But I really hope that our congresspeople get their act together. And frankly, we in the crypto industry should be voicing that I wrote my congressman and asked for him to take action on it. And so, like, we really need to stay focused and engage. If you look at coin fund, that's been our thesis is like, we want to engage. We want to engage with regulators, we want to engage with policymakers, and that'll continue to be our approach until we get to a good place."

And if this ends up at the Supreme Court again, that's not how you want to go about clarity. But as we sit today, gosh, I think XRP looks a lot like oranges and will continue to move forward accordingly. And Coinbase took appropriate action and other exchanges. But, gosh, wouldn't it be better if we had very thoughtful, nuanced policies? We put out a paper a while back that talked about how we think about the world.

We see a lot of smart contracts come out there for fundraising purposes, and a lot of people end up getting rugged. Right? So what is the most impactful regulation we can have to prevent that? Well, I would argue, like, you know, we should use some of the aspects of the technology, you know, in our favor. And one of the, one of the aspects of blockchain technology is that smart contracts are incredibly transparent. They're formally verifiable. You can audit them and, and see if they have a back door. You can create a formal verification system which checks the same. And so, like, one simple thing you can do is require that any smart contract that is raising money from, you know, market participants passes a basic principle. It doesn't steal your money. Right. And you can do that in an incredibly technical way. And it seems like very obvious, I often think about in the future that we can trend toward those very productive principles based approaches that solve some of these problems.

Well, we would need to have good disclosures to make sure that people understand what they're doing. If you look at legacy traditional markets, you can't understand the disclosures. You have to pay a lawyer a lot of money to explain what you're getting into. So how do you put forth, like, very thoughtful disclosures? Client asset protections are very, very important. And yes, there's like, technology plays a core role in that. And we should recognize that technology and allow it, not say, hey, MPC technology, it doesn't fit certain qualified rules. So let's get rid of it. No. How do we use technology to solve for those principles? And that principle is something like client protection. Right. There are a number of other principles that we believe in. And the other thing that I like to talk about is, like, the technology that we're applying here that solves for those principles. Well, traditional finance should do it too, because principles are the same and we should use the best technology at our fingertips to be able to use it. So it should go across the board and they should be held to a higher standard as well."

Right. Why is that acceptable from a risk perspective? And how do we leverage blockchain technology to close that risk? Because it's really not acceptable.

It's not fun, trust me. And so the one thing that I love that I'm seeing right now is that technology is coming online that allows us to be much more thoughtful around things like certified credentials.

There's much more effective ways that you can affect the principles based outcomes that you're looking for using smart contracts. I don't think as a broadly, we all collectively as regulators, are yet at a place where we're fully appreciating the innovation that has happened in blockchains and in smart contracts. And it will take some time for those kinds of principles based approaches to make it through. Laura, you asked what would be on my wish list for, for this. I think one thing is definitely just a sensible framework where innovative Americans can try some of these technologies and surface the benefits and make the world into a better place. We do not have that in the United States today. We have an environment of uncertainty, unclarity, and it is extremely dangerous, in the explicit, straightforward sense of that word, to be a founder in blockchain. And that really should change if the US wants to maintain a lead as an innovator."

Elected officials. But I was really pleased that the CFTC put forth this GMAC, the global markets Advisory committee. It's one of five committees that they have that advised them. We were named to help participate. And like I said, we met a couple weeks ago and half the day was focused on tokenization, which was great. But what's more exciting is that they did form a digital asset subcommittee. And one thing that they reached out to me very recently and they said, would you look at nfts and utility tokens? So what's, the point that I'm trying to make is that they're engaging, and I think that's really good. We need to do more of it on the nfts and utility token side of things. I'm super excited because I don't know all the details of what they're looking for, but if they're looking for ideas on how to thoughtfully regulate it, I know our approach at coin fund is to reach out to the community, find the best experts, subject matter experts in the world, and really put forth our best foot to engage them. And so I guess that's how we're going to try to move this thing forward, and it's an exciting time with that kind of engagement."
