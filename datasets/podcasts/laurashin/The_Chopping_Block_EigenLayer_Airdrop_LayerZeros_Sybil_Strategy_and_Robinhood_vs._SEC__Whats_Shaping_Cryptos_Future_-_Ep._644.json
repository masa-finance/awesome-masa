        "text": "So let's jump into it. We got a lot of news to get through today. So, vitral, just for everybody's context, vitro runs one of the largest firms in the space electric capital. They're also a VC fund based in Silicon Valley. You guys have been an early investor into Eigen layer. Everybody on the show is an Eigen layer investor to some extent, some more than others. So, Eigen layer, we talked about it last week. Eigen layer, for those of you don't know, it's a restaking protocol. I guess it's now more than a restaking protocol. Now it's an inter subjective work token, as it's called. But whatever the market says, it's a restaking protocol. So we'll call it that. So they had. They were one of the most. The highest TVL protocol in crypto. Over $15 billion were deposited into Eigen layer. And those deposits were in search of points, which the expectation was that would eventually convert into an airdrop. So that airdrop took place last week. And that airdrop was very widely criticized for several reasons. One reason being that many people were geoblocked. Although they were allowed to receive points and participate in staking, they were not able to receive. They were not eligible to receive their airdrop for their points. And then second, the fact that it was a linear distribution, meaning that the more dollars you had at stake, proportionally, the more tokens you received. And many people criticized Eigen Lair because they were small stakers. They didn't get very much in the way of points. And as a result, they didn't get very much in the way of an airdrop. So after receiving lots and lots of criticism from the community, Eigen layer basically went to the community and said, hey, guys, first of all, there's been a lot of speculation that the VC's are going to be unlocking before the rest of the team. This is not true. And the investors and the team will be unlocking with a one year cliff after the tokens are transferable. So the other element is that. So Eigen layer came out and announced that they were going to be. In response to the community feedback, as they called it, they decided that they are now going to do an airdrop to all addresses that interacted with Eigen layer. So 200,000 addresses will each get 100 Eigen which is something on the order of about $1,000. According to what? Right now, the Eigen tokens are being priced at using the Evo futures Eigen token, of course, is not transferable. There's no real price yet, but that's what the market thinks the price of these Eigen tokens will be worth. So many people have described this as basically protocol bullying. Essentially lots and lots of people getting really mad at the protocol and forcing the protocol, forcing the protocol to basically back down, change their mind, and go ahead and distribute. The fact, despite the fact that it's widely known, that there were many, many industrial airdrop farming operations taking place on Eigen layer, and Eigen layer more or less capitulated and said, look, we were planning to create a distribution that didn't reward those people, but everybody's mad. So we are going to go ahead and distribute more tokens in order to reward those people as well, which feels like, and many people criticize them for this, feels like fundamentally rewarding people and advancing the meta such that people who are doing industrial airdrop farming are more incentivized to continue doing that because of the scale of rewards that they've received for doing these kinds of very, very large scale airdrop farming. Okay, so there's a second airdrop farming story, and I want to tie these two together because it feels like the conversation about airdrops is tying both of these together. So a second protocol called Layer Zero. Layer Zero is probably the largest decentralized bridge protocol. They have a huge amount of activity crossing many, many chains, including Solana, SWe, Aptos, as well as many of the things in the EVM ecosystem. So Layer Zero's airdrop has been very, very widely anticipated, and they finally announced that they were going to do their airdrop distribution. But they know that there's a lot of addresses that have been interacting with Layer Zero who are Sybils. Sybil, meaning that these are users who are creating fake addresses to try to pretend that they're multiple users, when in fact, it's only one person controlling many, many addresses. So layer Zero announced a Sybil self reporting program such that if you were a Sybil, if you were industrial airdrop farming, you're creating lots and lots of accounts. You know what you did, and if you are willing to report yourself, you will get 15% of the allocation you would have otherwise received. If you are a good actor, however, if they find you and they know that you are Sybil, they're going to take 100% of your allocation away and if you report somebody else and you know that they were a Sybil, then you get some portion of their award. So now this is a, this is actually not the first time that this mechanism has been tried, but it is by far the largest scale of this kind of airdrop report, or Sybil attack reporting structure that we have seen in crypto. And this has also resulted in a lot of both commentary on the positive side as well as criticism. So this feels like a week where the metagame around airdrops is shifting, and we're going to learn a lot from how these two airdrops affect future airdrops and future token and points distributions. So I want to stop there and get a read from you guys. What do you think about Eigen layer backing down and layer zero doing this new self reporting civil mechanism? Avicii, want to get your response?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Well, I think on the Eigen lair one, it's interesting you framed it that way, because I actually interpreted it slightly differently. I interpreted it as there were two separate things that were going on. They did this sort of linear drop to sort of disincentivize the civil attackers. But then people. My understanding or my read, I could be wrong on this, obviously, but my read was people were upset that they didn't give enough to the small people. And so it was not so much that the Sybil stuff was a. Was an issue. It was. They felt that they were not being like, you want to sort of reward the small guy in some sense. And that's what the purpose of these things is supposed to be. And so that adjustment that they were making, my interpretation of it was that it was, it was intended not so much as like a civil back down kind of a situation. It just. The side effect happens to be that if you had sibled the thing, you might have gotten more, but the intention was to try to reward the small guys. I don't know. Is that. I'm curious. Tom, you're nodding. Was that your two."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that is right. The problem is you can't know which addresses are symbol generated addresses and which ones are genuine small stakers. Obviously, in an ideal world, it would be great to give every single individual a fixed amount of the token supply and then maybe some linear scalar component based on how much they've staked or how much volume done or whatever. But in practice, it's just like basically impossible to do that. And I think that's why they kind of have this problem. And I don't know, I think it feels very goofy, too, just because for the amount of eigen that they're giving for the projected dollar amount, it's not like this is going to be so meaningful for the people who are transacting on ETH mainnet and therefore actually putting ETH into eigen layer. It feels like, spiritually, I understand the idea of, again, wanting to reward these small players, but it feels like it's really. Like you can't really, I think, frame this in a way that that's actually what it's trying to accomplish. Like, the only reason why someone would be happy about getting 100 Eigen is if they had thousands of addresses and they were a civil attacker, and this is their new sort of yield source."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "That's an interesting way to think about it. I don't disagree with that. I think where it comes from more is that, like, you know, the points themselves were supposed to be signaling the token allocation that you'd be receiving, right. If you wanted points to be sub linear or super linear, I guess. Meaning that, you know, the fewer. No, wait, what is that function? Decaying. Right? Decaying over time. If you wanted the points allocation to be decaying over time, such that when you created a new address, you got more points in the beginning and your points tapered off the bigger you were, that would be a way of signaling to people, I want more addresses, right. I expect you to receive fewer tokens, the bigger you are. But that's not what they were signaling. They were signaling very clearly. We were awarding one thing, which is TVL over time. And when you sort of go back and you say, oh, whoops a daisy, we didn't realize that there were a lot of real people who didn't get a lot of token allocation relative to the big guys. Really what they're saying is that the rewards that we gave you, which we signaled very, very clearly during the people, knew very clearly what the allocative mechanism for the points were, that people were just ultimately not happy with the fact that this thing, which had $15 billion."

I think the bitcoin maxi equivalent for this cycle should be not your on chain merkel distribution, not your real tokens. If this point system doesn't give you any contractual guarantees over the actual redemption amount, then that's your fault for fucking believing that's a terms of service thing that you participated in, and you misappropriately assumed it was pro rata or had some minimum threshold. But, like, that's not true, right? It's not, it's not an airdrop in that sense. It's not like a standard liquidity mining airdrop. And you, the user subscribe to that.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No, no, I agree, but, but they made a wrong mistake in their model, right? That's, that's the point. Like, there were a ton of people, for instance, front type points were the greatest example of this, where there was like many people writing out like, because I think frontex initial point distributions were really bad. And it was kind of easy to figure out the particular actions that were getting like 90% of the points. And people were doing these very simple linear regressions to what people's on chain actions were. And they're like, oh, okay, clearly this thing is the highest elasticity. So we're all going to just like spam our own chat. Stuff like that would get you more points than having other people talk in your chat. There was like a bunch of like weird little mishaps in how they're doing the allocation. And so the point of these point systems is to give the dev team flexibility. But by that, that also means that you, the user, have no guarantee, right. You have some expected allocation that you can fit, but you might have fit it very incorrectly. And I think like, right, but this."

My point is that this is the reason I bring up the not your keys, not your coins type of thing is if you have no guarantees or commitment to the strategy for distribution, then don't fucking expect that you should get a certain number of tokens. That's a mindset problem. And obviously the teams are caving, but they're not caving fully either. Right. They're definitely not giving into all the demands. And I would say layer zero is taking the most aggressive version of not caving. The interesting thing that I've been kind of wondering about, about the Sybil stuff in the long run is at some point the industrial air farmers will have sufficient resources and scale to just try to sue the teams. And the teams are very easy to sue."

So I, as I'm thinking about it, I think I might be convinced by you. I think there will be resources that these sibyls have, and then they will threaten the lawsuit.

What is your take on what a team should do? Now, let's say you are starting from scratch. You're beginning your points program. What have you learned from this week within layer zero and the Eigen lair drama? What is the new playbook?"

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Very hard to say. I think part of it is with something like Eigen layer, there's a very clear narrative and story around why it should be time capital weighted. Whereas for a lot of other airdrops, it's like, well, if you provided liquidity on blur and you had sort of resting bids and asks, how do you provide points for that? And how do you provide some function that converts the value that you're providing into some sort of. Of points? And so I think, as always, it's sort of context dependent. I do kind of wish Eigen Lair had not sort of folded to the community. I think most of what people were upset by was the geo blocking stuff and the lockup terms. I don't really get the impression that, again, this was a meaningful sticking point for all of these addresses. I think that the layer zero thing, I think it's very clever or in self reporting to get the 15% of the intended allocation. But it also reminds me a little bit of people who say that, oh, there should be a policy that if you hack a protocol, you can return 90% of the hack and keep 10% and you can walk away scot free. And they're like, oh, well, that's our bug bounty effectively. And I think in practice that just creates an incentive to hack the protocol because you sort of have this dollar value placed on what the proceeds are going to be. And so I think similarly, hey, maybe this worked one time for layer zero, and maybe it's kind of clever, but I'm a little bit worried about this becoming a precedent going forward just because, well, now you know that you can walk, you can symbol attacker protocol as much as you want, self report, and walk away with still a pretty large sum of cash. And again, there's very little marginal cost to spending of new address doing some transactions, which is, it's kind of the whole point of Sybil attacks in the first place."

I was kind of surprised by how long it lasted and how intense it was about trying to prove that it discredited and try to get it to not be used in police investigations.

The most famous of which, of course, was Friendtech, which you might remember last year was the super hot social fi application that kind of more or less invented the category. Now, friendtech, their activity really fell off after last summer, but they've been teasing that they're going to launch a token, and they recently did. Over the course of the last week, they launched their token, currently trading somewhere in the order about 200 million. Fully diluted valuation. But interestingly, again, in opposition to a lot of the tokens that have come out in this cycle, Friendtech supposedly has no vc allocation and has also no team allocation. So the token is completely just 100% community distribution, or at least that's what the team seems to be indicating. It's not super clear, but that's what everybody seems to be interpreting them as saying. So they launched a couple of new features. Although the app was kind of buggy when it initially launched, it's very much far from all time highs, but we're seeing a little bit of a comeback for friendtech and getting a little bit of rejuvenation into the protocol. And then you've got fantasy top, as Tom just mentioned, this new viral game on Blast right now, it's got about 33,000 weekly active users, 9000 ETH in trading volume. Apparently there are more addresses trading fantasy top cards than trading all nfts on Ethereum. So fantasy top has really kind of grabbed people's, I don't know, imagination is the word, but it's certainly been super high engagement. So what do you guys see? What are you guys seeing with respect to this kind of comeback and this narrative shift with respect to socialfi?"

And so there's sort of like an implicit leaderboard, like, very, very similar mechanics that we're basically reinventing here. Now, of course, the two differences, I think. One, you're dealing with real money here, not fake points inside some canvas app. And two, back then, social wasn't nearly as developed as it is today. So there wasn't this notion of influencer. And so you didn't have data, you know, like, in fantasy sports, you have data like you scored a touchdown or something. So it's like, what are you speculating on? Like, you need some input that that is variable over time and somewhat unpredictable to be able to speculate in that way. And that didn't really exist at the time on Facebook. It's just the network was not developed enough yet. And so, I mean, there's an argument that between real money and sort of the randomness of, you know, like, how many impressions is Tom gonna get this week or something, that maybe there's some stickiness to this thing. But it's interesting because this is actually not the first time we're sort of reinventing all the social stuff from 1520 years ago, because humans haven't really changed in 20 years.

So like if you look at Facebook, the moat is all the friends content because you just can't get that anywhere else. It's like somebody had a baby or somebody got married or whatever. But the monetization is all the public stuff. It's like some small business needs to promote something or there's some news thing. And if you get rid of the moat, the monetization, you just sort of like Facebook would collapse to Yahoo News. It's just not that useful and not that good of business. And that combination is really powerful. And so it's actually really interesting to see that the monetization is different than the moat. The moat is the organic content that people want to come and see and the prices and all that kind of stuff. But then they sort of have a totally different monetization model that's actually really clever. And it parallels actually what you kind of see in traditional social as well."

But it is very rare to see that spark, especially, frankly, in. In crypto, where a lot of stuff feels much more transactional, purely financialized, maybe game or incentivized in some way.

It's, like, only a little bit better than that. It doesn't feel like we've kind of, like, got the full experience. You know, when you compare the crypto social apps to, like, TikTok, I know you shouldn't be comparing the two extremes, but, like, you know, it sort of feels Dracula. Sure, sure. That's true. That's true. That's true. There is Dracula also, disclosure. I am a Dracula investor, so I shouldn't say that. I shouldn't say that as a. But what I mean, it's still not the same. You know, like, the content stuff isn't the same. The kind of, like, the feed algorithms aren't the same stuff. Like, so, so if it. But my point is, in the same way, like, pokes felt really dumb, but they, like, encouraged user actions that, like, people would. Thought were too silly or too weird or whatever. I feel like there's a lot of that in the social fi stuff now where it's, like, silly actions that people are, like, spending money on. And so there's sort of this weird aspect of that which feels like it's real, but it's not clear to me what the velocity is. It's clearly. The gradient is positive. Is it barely positive, or is it really growing? And I don't have that much of an opinion on that. I think the finding new monetization mechanisms outside of the airdrop thing. That is a very.

And so I don't know if you guys are talking about this internally, Tom, but to me, this feels like social 2003, which is kind of like all of the pieces of what became a social network kind of existed. There's the notion of a graph. There's the notion of a friend. There's a profile pic, there's a profile page. People had sort of proto feeds. You had the poke, you had the beginnings of the like in 2005. Like, all of those little components existed. And so now what we have are things like, you have amms, you have frames on Farcaster, you have the ability to do micropayments. You have every app as a wallet. You have this notion of friend content, or you can buy the friend. You have these little components. And Haseeb, kind of the way you put it is, I think, right, too, is it's sort of the preconditions for life. You got a bunch of rna snippets floating around, and they're going to come together at some point in the next couple of years because somebody's going to figure out the magic is, oh, it's this kind of a graph propagated it in this way. It's this sort of an edge. It's bi directional or unidirectional. It's this kind of privacy model. The asset that people really want to buy is XYZ. The way you monetize it is ABC. And it's because you have the wallet baked in, like, all of the preconditions are there. And so to me, I don't even think we've hit my space yet, just to be clear. But like that MySpace moment when it happened, there's this light bulb that went off for a lot of people that were like, okay, this is the thing. I don't think we're quite there yet. Maybe farcaster is that thing. Um, but I think we have all the necessary preconditions now. And so I, I'm actually quite optimistic that sometime over the next, like, two to four years, somebody's going to stumble into the thing that gets to a hundred million users, like, pretty fast."

It's like, okay, there's a reason why this stuff is interesting and novel and differentiated from everything that people have kind of been trying before. And I think that kind of shows in some of the numbers."

        "text": "So the one thing I will say is, like, so far, other than this friendtech amm monetization thing, I feel like we haven't seen anyone go do any, like, radical experiments with how they're, you know, getting people to pay for things. Like, for instance, one type of thing that is my personal hobby force. And I'm always, like, trying to find people who are working, like, kind of adjacent to this because, like, I always meet these people at hackathons, but no one ever, like, wants to do it for longer than a hackathon, which maybe says something. But, you know, in the normal social world, the ranking algorithm, the newsfeed, the ordering is sort of like completely controlled by the central entity. Like, yeah, sure, there's ad exchanges and ad auctions that like, impact some of the feed. But, you know, generally the quality, quality of feed is more valuable than like, the ads in the feed for how in order to keep up, like retention statistics and stuff like that. But these open social graphs have this, like, kind of crazy ability where like, I can give everyone their own sort of weird feed and they can, and people can pay to be like, higher in your feed, more expressed in your feed, whatever. Right. And I think, I think frontech is kind of getting in that with these rooms where like, you know, the clubs. Yeah. And I kind of feel like that that is the part that's, like, missing to me right now is like this idea of taking advantage of the graph to give very like, monetized views of the same data where people pay to either show you a particular view of the world. Like, in influencer, it's not just the influencer showing you an ad, they're showing you a montage, they're showing you, they're giving you the entire TikTok. Recommendations. They would, they're able to control the algorithm that generates recommendations or something that does something like that, that takes advantage. I just feel like we haven't quite crossed the chasm where it's easy to do those types of things yet. It feels like it's still a little bit hard for developers to do that type of thing stuff. And the amm thing is great because it's like people understand it. It's easy to add a fee to whatever, right? But I feel like the next level would be actually using the social data and finding weird monetization things that make sense."

        "text": "Well, I was gonna say two things. One, actually, it's not immediately obvious to me that developer friction is necessarily a bad thing. Like another little sort of tidbit from consumer social history. Friendster was really taking off. Friendster was the thing before MySpace and Friendster fell apart because they didn't have a good way to do the performance. They did a bunch of assumptions about how to load pages, and performance is terrible. And one of the things that they really struggled with was how to traverse the graph to find your second degree connections. It was actually still a pretty clunky developer experience to build a social network in zero three, but it was just good enough that you could get a couple million people on it. And then one thing you said, tarun, actually kind of for me, the light bulb moment was actually frames. And the girl scout cookie experiment, if anybody was tracking that, because the inline buy is a totally different monetization model, and you don't need ads if you can just buy stuff in line, because you can just take a vig. And that to me was a huge light bulb moment, because all of a sudden it was like, oh, you don't need ads in this thing if you can drive commerce through these things, which has always been actually one of the holy grails if you think about the Internet. There's two business models at a high level on the Internet. There's attention and intention, and Facebook and YouTube really capture attention, but they've always struggled to capture intention, whereas Google and Amazon capture intention. And so what's really interesting about these social networks to me is if you could capture intent and then monetize that intent, you would actually have a fundamentally different business model. And so to me, the light bulb moment was actually frames on the monetization side."

But I was catching up with Kyle Somani recently, and he was telling me that in the multicoin investment committee, Kyle has banned the use of any analogies. If you use an analogy, you are automatically kicked out of investment committee. And so all these analogies to traditional social media, I wonder a little bit if we are sort of over reliant on the basically this idea that, okay, we're kind of speed running the history of social media and we're going to play it back in the same order. Because on some level, if we do, I think we on some level just kind of arrive at a worse version of what's already there. Right. We're sort of kind of stamping in the territory of the mastodons and the true socials and the whatever, because it's actually very hard to fill the niche that's just. Okay, let's find a very close permutation of a social network that already exists. It does seem to me like if crypto social works, it's going to fill a niche that nobody else is filling, and that's why it's going to be so good. Right. There's going to be something that's kind of weird about the particular way in which you want to express yourself and you want to interact with this particular network. I don't have a clear enough thesis about what that is, but it does feel to me like if you hew too closely to, well, we're going to go through the same iterations as kind of web two social media. I think you end up arriving at what a lot of these social media pitches I get are, which are basically, look, I'm going to transpose an existing social network into crypto, and those seem to almost reliably not work."

But to me, the interesting takeaway is not that the reasoning by analogy gets you to the outcome. The interesting part of the exercise is that is how the market reasons through what to do. So, like, the first wave of stuff that doesn't work is going to be people doing these skeuomorphic things in social, and so they're going to pattern match to what worked. And so the fact that that's happening to me is why it's sort of like proto social. It's like it's, we're not actually at the place yet in the market where people are, like, doing, combining these novel primitives in a way that is actually going to be crypto native. But the fact that we've now gotten to a point where people are trying to recreate and speed run the stuff that worked previously is actually, to me, the precursor signal, because I agree with you, and I agree with Kyle, that that's, like, not the right way to figure out what's going to work.

        "text": "Right. Okay, so let's switch gears one more time. Going away from the product and going more towards the legal. So it's been a busy week for legal and regulatory, and we actually skipped one story last week that I'm going to tie in here. So the SEC has been very hard at work, basically, in their campaign against the crypto industry. So a couple of weeks ago, the SEC, we talked about them filing a wells notice, which is basically letting somebody know that they intend to file a lawsuit or an enforcement action against them. They gave a wells notice to Uniswap, and Uniswap announced that they were going to be fighting against any potential lawsuit from the SEC. The SEC also filed a wells notice against consensys, which, of course, is the company founded by Joe Lubin, which is kind of early ethereum ecosystem company that is also the creator of Metamask. So apparently, the SEC claimed that Metamask was an unregistered broker, which, of course, is the claim that was dismissed in the Coinbase case about Coinbase wallet being an unregistered broker, as well as Metamask staking being some, you know, metabolic staking products being unregistered securities, which is much in line with their claims against all the staking products that they've gone after. So now, consensus beyond just saying, we are going to defend ourselves and fight back in court, proactively sued the SEC in Texas, which I think is the fifth Circuit. Something. Some circuit. I don't know. I was just talking with something about this the other day. So, basically, under the thesis that the SEC, apparently, they like to bring cases in either New York or DC, because these circuits, basically, the circuit being a subsection of the country where basically your appellate system is segregated by these different circuits, or these subsections of the country, there are nine, I believe. And so the SEC likes to bring cases in the circuits that tend to be kind of government favorable. So in DC and New York, usually, the judges tend to be more pro government, whereas in Texas, surprise, surprise, the judges there tend not to like the government as much, and therefore, the odds are all things equal that you're likely to get a more favorable ruling. And so consensus sort of went on the offensive and said, we are going to proactively sue you for failing to make rules, despite the fact that you're supposed to be making rules under the administrative. Under the Administrative Procedures act, and you are not giving the industry clarity, and you're supposed to because of how agency is supposed to function. So consensus sued the SEC. Then a week later, Robinhood announced that they also got a wells notice from the SEC. Now, Robinhood is relatively unique among these players. If you think of Uniswap, you think of Coinbase, you think of consensus. These are all companies that are very active in crypto, and they do a lot of stuff. They have a lot of arms, and they were sort of taking a good amount of regulatory risk. Okay. Robinhood, of course, a public company, Robinhood was pretty anodyne in their approach to crypto. They were fairly conservative, so they essentially only allowed trading of assets. They did not allow any kind of exotic tokens. It's basically bitcoin, ethereum, sol, doge, stuff like that that they basically had on the platform. And they even delisted Sol and XRP when the SEC named them in their lawsuit as an unregistered security, which none of the other platforms did. But nevertheless, Robinhood was hit with a wells notice by the SEC. Robinhood went and went to Twitter, basically, and did the same thing everyone else has done, which is announced, we're going to fight this lawsuit, and we believe the SEC is being unfair and capricious."

The interesting thing as well is that when they announced that they were going to fight back against the wells notice, their stock dipped 2% and then fully recovered by the end of intraday trading, which also tells you that the market is no longer giving the SEC credit. Right. Remember when Coinbase got the lawsuit filed against them, the market tanked. It was like, oh, shit, this is terrible for the industry. Clearly, this means that it's over. When your regulator comes after you and basically says your business is de facto illegal, that generally means it's lights out. But now going down 0% in a day, I think is crazy. That's like, if you see the FTC, Lena Khan has been famously very, very aggressive against all these, uh, mergers. You know, her, her win rate in court is basically zero. She's not won a single one of these cases that have actually gone to trial. Um, it feels like the same thing is now happening to the SEC, which is that the markets are no longer giving credibility to the SEC for actually being able to win these cases. Because if it was true that the SEC is going to shut down their crypto trading business, then look, obviously a huge value, a huge part of the value of this business."

Okay, so stepping back for a second, because I think, Haseeb, your point on the FTC is a really good one. And tying that thread, I think, is actually really important to understand what's happening, because I spent a lot, I'm on the, I'm on the board of CCI, which is like us and paradigm and injuries and fidelity and block and a couple other folks. And I do a bunch of regulatory stuff. So I have, fortunately, a bunch of sort of information flow, sort of off the record kind of stuff that we get to understand. I think what's happened is that there's been a material shift in strategy. And that's what it used to be was that if the FTC or the SEC took you to court. They were doing it because they were really certain that they were going to win. And what's happened is there's been a strategic decision which has shifted, which is we're going to take cases to court, and if we're not losing some of these cases, we're not being aggressive enough in pursuing action. And that's a really, really important shift in terms of how the regulator interfaces with the markets and the entities that they're supposed to be regulating. And now, I think, sort of assuming best intent, you might argue that it's coming from a good place, which is anybody can look at the structure of the markets right now, or the structure of society and be like, okay, the rich are getting richer. There's a structural problem. There's no political will to actually solve some of these structural issues right now. And so there are people who arguably are well intentioned. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt for a second. You could reasonably disagree that they're well intentioned and are just being political, but let's assume for a second that they're being well intentioned. What they're essentially saying is, look, the political process is so broken that there's no way for us to meaningfully fix these issues at a structural level. And so we're going to be sort of turning these agencies into activist organizations that are going to try to fix it. Now, the problem is that they're taking on lawsuits and risks against companies like Activision and Microsoft or Coinbase or Ripple or consensus, which are extremely well capitalized companies. And those companies are saying, wait a second, there's no legal basis for what you're doing. And we still have rule of law in this country, and so they're taking it to court, and then these agencies are losing. And so I think the second order effect of potentially well intentioned action by people who see structural problems in society and in markets is actually causing the erosion of the integrity of these institutions, which is really, really bad. And that's actually what I worry about fundamentally, is it's very clear these guys are gonna lose in court. They're so overextended. They're just like, there's no legal basis for half the stuff that these guys are doing right now. So they're just going to lose in court. But the consequence of that is you now have to your point, Haseeb, the markets no longer trust the SEC at this point, which is terrible, like, because there's real fraud that might happen out there. And if the SEC is going to bring cases and people don't believe that there's fraud. Like, you start to lose, like well functioning markets. You start to lose, like rule of law, which is such an important, like, construct and why the economy works and why the american markets work. And that actually is very concerning to me. These guys are going to turn over. We'll outlast them. Consensus. Well, full disclosure, we're investors in consensus. Consensus will outlast them. Coinbase will outlast them. Robinhood will outlast them. But the damage that they're doing is permanent. And that, to me, is the real cost for concern here."

        "text": "I very well said, and I will underscore that with also saying that there's also a big asymmetry of power, which is that the government, part of the reason why our system of government is set up in the way that it is is because of the fact that it's well known that the government is the most powerful entity that exists. There's an obvious asymmetry of powers that the government can subpoena whatever they want and their resources. The SEC has billions of dollars, thousands of lawyers in their arsenal, and most of these companies are startups. Now, obviously, consensus. We are also investors. They are fairly well capitalized. So is Uniswap, so is know Robin Hood and Coinbase. They can fight for themselves. But of course, a lot of the people the SEC are going after do not have those kinds of resources. And as a result, there's a big asymmetry of power in the system, which is why, generally speaking, the presumption is that the government must have a very high burden to clear in order to go and target these people. Right? These are enforcement agencies. They're basically one step removed from law enforcement. And the presumption is that you want to have a lot of checks and balances in place such that these agencies cannot just go on political prosecutions. Right. They cannot just go say, look, I don't like this thing, therefore, I'm going to go attack it in order to pursue some kind of policy agenda. Right? Like regulars are not supposed to be setting policy. The legislature is there to enact policy, and the executive branch is there to execute the policy that's been determined by Congress within certain bounds. Right. Obviously, there's a bunch of guerriers at the margins. But what's really clear to my mind is that the system of government we have is designed to slow this kind of thing down, to make it difficult for these, you know, for each president to flip flop and totally change the regime. And that's why we have, you know, a very slow moving government. We have gridlock in Congress and people say, oh, it sucks. Why can Congress pass laws? Why can nothing happen in this country that is by design? We made a system of government intentionally so that people would have predictability. And it wouldn't be the case that every four years or every six years, you get entirely a new set of laws and a new set of rules. And basically companies and citizens are ultimately up to the whims of whoever gets elected over the next four years. And so I think that fight that we see the fights in Congress, the fights in the courts and the fights among the agencies is by design. And on some level, what the SEC is doing is kind of trying to sidestep those fights and not let them play out the way that they're supposed to and say, hey, instead of waiting for Congress to fight it out, instead of waiting for, you know, the courts to fight it out, we're just going to go and a Sybil attack essentially the industry and, you know, do a thousand."

But as with sort of the bitcoin ETF lawsuit, there's no real reasoning or there's no really good arguments. And it's a shame because there is real fraud in the industry and there should be some regulation. People have been asking for clarity forever. And Gensler goes on tv and says, oh, well, you need disclosures. What disclosures? We've been asking for years and years and years around, you know, how is, what is the path forward for these assets? Give some guidance and ultimately we've received silence."

Here's what you need to do in order to register, then I think everybody in the industry would be like, great, awesome. We will do that as long as they are sensible and they're tailored to what is different and meaningfully informative for digital assets. We have sort of, to some level, figured out as an industry, what are the useful disclosures for a crypto asset? What's the vesting schedule? What does the token do? Where's the white paper? What are the token mechanics? Where are the contracts? Point to all these things on chain so that people can go diligence them for themselves. When we diligence things, when we talk about things on the show, we are doing that diligence, which is what otherwise any financial investor would want access to. If you say that, well, no, no, no. We already have well defined securities laws. Then it's like, okay, well, I need to go fill out these forms that actually don't disclose any of the information that I just described. You can register security and say nothing about a token distribution or on chain addresses or whatever. And as a result, what's very clear is that, no, the idea that, well, we already have laws, and therefore just follow these, and then you'll be fine. No other country, no other regulator in the world has come to that conclusion except the SEC, which seems to be like, okay, this is just kind of a willful, just kind of aggression toward the industry of just saying, no, no, look, you guys don't have the right to exist. If you don't fit into our pre existing securities laws, as preexisting securities do, then you don't have a right to exist in financial markets. And I think overwhelmingly what you see is that beyond just the industry, I think most people think that that's bullshit. Right? Yeah. Like crypto or don't like crypto? Clearly, crypto is a thing, and it will exist. And so the question is, okay, how are you going to subsume it into an investor protection regime, which I think everybody's on board with? What does binance do? What does Coinbase do? They protect investors. They try to be thoughtful about making sure that you can read information about, what is this token? Who's working on it? Where are the tokens? How many are there? When do they get distributed? Every single place you look to that actually has retail investors interests at heart, which, of course, are these exchanges which service retail. They try to give that information to retail investors. So that's why I think this narrative that the SEC has been giving that look, we are the ones protecting retail. I think it's just disingenuous."

And anybody who sees the problem and has a hammer, like, sees a bunch of nails and they're using the hammer, but that there are real secondary consequences to these things. And the thing that I worry about, in addition to sort of the integrity of these institutions being eroded, is that there's a fundamental, there's even more like meta fundamental issue at stake here, which is we've seen a shift in how government, the us government thinks about technology. And if you contrast this with how the us government or other governments around the world are thinking about technology, I think the government's learned very different lessons from the Internet. I think what the us government learned inadvertently, which is incorrect, is that this stuff has consequences, which is obvious, but that they need to try to control it. But the reality is the world doesn't work the way that it did in 1995 anymore. Markets are global, capital is global, people can pick up and leave. And literally we see that happening. Look at Ilya from Nier. He just moved to Europe. He's one of the authors on a transformer paper and started near blockchain. And it where investors in the air, just full disclosure. But you know, that's like, that's such a huge loss to lose that person as a potential us citizen. And so there's like this lack of understanding of what the assumptions have changed in society. Meanwhile, the rest of the world that effectively lost the Internet, like all the big Internet companies, are american, right? Facebook and Amazon and Google and so on, looks at this and says, oh, we botched it. What we actually need to do is embrace this stuff, because if we don't have the tech companies in our jurisdiction, we have no oversight. We can't do anything about it. And so there's this weird bizarro world that we live in now, where the rest of the world, because they lost the Internet, is figuring out crypto and the american government as a consequence of winning the Internet. We just didn't learn the right lessons in this country. And so we're totally mangling it. And it's because the fundamental assumptions about what regulation, what power regulators have these days is just so wrong. It's stuck. And it's a consequence of just the gerontocracy, right? It's like you have a bunch of these people who think the world works a certain way, just the world doesn't work that way anymore. And it's not clear to me that they have internalized that the world doesn't work that way anymore. And it's such a huge miss. I'm 1000% on. Tarun, what you were talking about with stable coins and national security, it's just like anybody who understands the role of the dollar in the world should be running so fast at crypto in the us government, and it's just such a missed opportunity."

        "text": "I think where a lot of it comes from as well, is just cynicism. It feels like there's just an increasing cynicism about technology. And interestingly, we're also seeing it now happen in crypto. This ties some of the threads we were talking about earlier with airdrop farming and VC coins and all this. There has been this increasing trend of people talking about this idea that retail investors are getting exhausted with all these VC coins and these VC coins. When people say VC coins, generally what they mean is that these are venture backed startups with technologists that are telling this big technology story about a DA layer or a new l one or a new l two or whatever. The criticism against these is that there are a lot of them. They all launch with relatively low floats and high ftvs, FTV meaning fully diluted valuation. So a small amount of the token is floating, so 10%, 8%, whatever. But the total supply, when it's fully unlocked is going to be ten times that or something like that. And there's a sense, or at least many people have been claiming that retail is getting exhausted by this because they keep losing as the supply gets unlocked and the VC's dump on them. They're just going to lose and lose and lose. So the canonical example is something like ICP or Dfinity, which started off with a very, very high valuation or fully diluted valuation has been slowly creeping down over time. And the sense of, okay, well, retail is exiting by saying, you know what, we're just gonna trade meme coins. Because meme coins, they're fully circulating day one. There's no extra supply we have to worry about. And yeah, okay, maybe you guys are telling us big technology stories, but we don't buy it anymore. This whole thing is just a big game of musical chairs. And so we're just gonna play the musical chairs amongst ourselves and cut out the middlemen, which are the bullshit VC's. So it does feel like I'm seeing the sentiment a lot. I'm also hearing it from other VC's. Right? So, like, I was chatting with Regan Bosman from lattice fund, and he's been writing all these Twitter threads, talking about."

And so it feels like that cynicism is not just the us government, it's also retail or crypto Twitter. I can't tell how much of it is actually retail and how much of it is just this sentiment is what people want to upvote right now. But at the same time, like, all these high ftv launches are still having high ftvs. So it's not as though like, the ftvs are coming down. So I'm curious what you guys think and how that filters into how we talked about this a little bit on the last show, how there's all this anti vc sentiment that seems to be materializing, maybe as a byproduct of the cycle."

The problem is, like, most of this stuff is nothing. An existing thing that has been tweaked slightly has no real activity users. I mean, there's even an article in, I can't remember which publication about like zombie chains from 2017 this week, which is I think, kind of the equivalent from that era, but for this era, and I don't think the VC allocation really matters that much. I mean, again, most of the top projects that we know and love, I mean, had meaningful vc allocations. The difference was that they were doing something different.

And so a lot of this stuff to me is this sense of I'm being left out of the system. Like people have talked about this sort of financial nihilism kind of stuff and that leads to meme coins. So I think a lot of this anti vc sentiment is sort of like, why are people who are not creating value getting rich? That doesn't feel fair, which I think is actually a fair sentiment. It does feel like society has all these feedback loops we talk about in technology. We talk about feedback loops. Society has a bunch of feedback loops too. And a lot of those feedback loops have led to people who are creating far less value than they may have 20 years ago, continuing to extract massive amounts of money. And that just feels fundamentally unfair. So I'm actually sympathetic to the argument because it does feel like the rich getting richer and that's not healthy for society. But I don't think the problem is that there are categories of really high value add VC's. You can go talk to the founders, just go talk to founders and be like, hey, does electric create value? Does robot create value? Does dragonfly create value? Does paradigm create value? You can run through the list and you're like, yeah, there are actually people who roll up their sleeves and get to work with you. But I get the sentiment. I think the sentiment is coming from a reasonable place actually, that I'm being left out of the system and these other people keep getting richer, and that feels unfair. That's a bigger than crypto thing. I think it's being manifest in crypto, but it's happening all over the world. It's the root cause of the SEC stuff. It's the root cause of the FTC stuff, the root cause of the rise of populism. It's happening in a lot of places. I wish I knew how to solve it, but I look at this as not like a VC coin problem.

I feel like what happens is you have this thing where it's overdone, and then in the depths of despair, you find the thing that people really care about in the ETH or Solana or things like uniswap, things that came after that.

I think it's obviously in fashion right now to talk about this of like, oh, there's too many low FTV launches, and it's all these VT coins, or who's going to buy all these tokens? Just go on binance and just go look at what are the most traded tokens? And the answer, like, that's retail. That's what retail actually is. It's not crypto Twitter. Crypto Twitter is not retail. Right. Crypto Twitter is crypto influencers. And, like, it's a very easy mistake to make, which is to assume that crypto influencers are representatives of retail, but they are. But they are actually not. And that's true every cycle, is that you can make the mistake of assuming that what people with big followings think are what retail thinks, and it's generally wrong, and it's always wrong in a different direction. And like, if you just go look on binance at what people are trading, people are trading VC coins, they're also trading meme coins, but meme coins are not dominating the market. It's not as though, like, well, they're trading mostly doge and wif and Shiba Inu and almost nothing else. Like, that's just not true. Anybody who thinks that, like, well, everyone's exhausted with the VC coins. They don't care about technology. They only want to gamble on this financial nihilism stuff that is incorrect, go read the trading logs. That's not what they're mostly gambling on. There's, there's a lot of people gambling on that, of course, but there's way more people buying a bitcoin and ether and sol and, um, you know, whatever. These, these newer coins as well, that are hot and AI coins and near and blah, blah blah, these are also trading huge amounts of volume in. And the reality is, like, most of what crypto is about is about technology. And what we're doing here is trying to build better technology, which is most of what retail cares about. They care about this story. So there is a subset of the market that's just like, look, fuck it, Wall street bets, nothing matters. Let's just like, let's just gamble and try to make 1000 x on absolutely meaningless dog coins. And that's okay. And there's always going to be some version of that in every cycle, because crypto is ultimately a very easy way to remix just convexity and make convexity fun and kind of dynamic. But I just don't think it's that simple of a story that vc coins bad, meme coins good, and you guys have ruined the party for everyone. I do think there are a lot of tokens that will go down in value, but as Saroon said, that happens in every cycle. So I don't think that's unique. There will probably be a lot of these tokens that are eventually traded for a fraction of what they're worth, and one or two of them that end up massively, massively valuable and are worth way more than they're even worth today. Even though you might think today their valuations are eye popping. And that's what venture looks like. That's what normal distribution of outcomes looks like, for any cohort of technologies.
