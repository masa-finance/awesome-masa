It's also a very small part of what people are doing on chain, because almost all of this is on Solana. And Solana right now. I mean, obviously Solana has a lot of activity. You know, it's like maybe chain number two or three by total activity, which means that if you look at the top ten chains, most of the stuff happening on there is not this kind of crazy meme coin mania thing that is happening on Solana. And part of it is, of course, the unique nature of Solana makes it well suited for this kind of thing. Of like somebody coming, some guy you went to high school with, playing with $10 and trading random dog coins. But it is also something that it certainly seems that Solana has this cultural position in the market, that it really worked for these low value nfts in the last cycle. And now that's transitioned into these low value meme coins. Of course, in absolute terms, the big meme coins, dogecoin, shiba, floki, all this stuff, obviously there is bonk on Solana, but the big meme coins are not on Solana either.

It is a distrust of government. It was very loudly, a distrust of fiat currency itself. It's all the things that make you want to give up on the existing system were the sort of ingredients that catalyze bitcoin. And it's those same ingredients that I think are leading to financial annihilation in faster, cheaper, more fun, more meme, more jokey assets like these made up 30 seconds ago. Assets on Solana. And there wasn't this ability to create so many assets in the advent of bitcoin. There was one asset. It was the OG. It was the original, it was the only asset, the only blockchain really, standing alone for quite remarkably long time. Even when there were new blockchains, there were forks of bitcoin. I think if bitcoin were founded today, it would be very different, and I do think it's related.

So in some sense, okay, let's say that you're, I don't know, Tarun's high school friend, and you're coming on board to trade meme coins, right? And obviously the meme coins are stupid, and they have frogs and dogs and whatever random bullshit on them and the misspellings of politicians. But it's not that different in kinderg, in terms of what you're actually doing day to day. It's not that different from what you were doing when you were flipping nfts, and it's not that different from what you were doing when you were trading random icos. The difference is that the NFTs and the ICOs had a story. There was some story that was remotely plausible about why these things had intrinsic value. And with the meme coins, there's no longer any story of why these things have intrinsic value. But here's the counterpoint I would make to that is that, like the game that fundamentally these people were playing was similarly cynical through every cycle, right? When you're flipping icos, when you're flipping meme coins, when you're flipping nfts, it's all the same feeling that you have, which is you don't believe any of this stuff. You might think someone else believes it, and that's why you're flipping this, you know, random fucking, you know, Iot ICO that you did in 2017, but you're assuming that somebody else is that greater fool. That's actually buying this. Genuinely thinking real. Right. And in some sense, perhaps that was never true at all. Perhaps there was nobody who actually thought that. The IoT ICO in 2017."

And so it turned out that a lot of people who were trading meme coins were getting ruthlessly sandwiched in GTO blocks. And the sandwich attacks were getting very, very intense, because, of course, when people are trading meme coins, they're retail. They don't really know what they're doing. They're not setting very strict slippage limits. And so there was a lot of money being made by people capturing Mev by essentially front running, back running, or essentially sandwich attacking people who are trading meme coins. So sandwich attack means you front run and then you back run to sell out, so you're not taking any risk. And so the Jitto team announced that they were going to be shutting off their mempool service. Their public mempool service, which is Solana doesnt normally have a mempool GTO, exposes a quasi mempool such that people can see whats happening. Thats a pending transaction, and go package up a bundle around it and front run it or back run it or sandwich it. They announced that they were shutting this off so that the experience on Solana was going to be improved for users, and they werent going to be front run as aggressively. This was largely lauded in the Solana ecosystem, but it seems to have been response to the fact that so much of Solana at this point is a story around people trading meme coins. And the MEV extraction was getting to be such a big issue for people trading on Solana. Now you guys are investors in Jito. This seemed really bizarre to me, that it's the opposite of what Flashbots has done. Flashbots has said, hey, we're accelerationists. This is the end game. Obviously, Mev is going to be extracted at scale, at equilibrium. So let's find the best way to do it. Uh, Solana, as far as I can tell, Solana foundation more or less knocked on their door, was like, hey, yo, this bad for the network? Please turn this off. And they were like, okay.

Bundler, it's the Bundler still running. Right. That was their main product initially. The mempool was actually the second product. I think one of the issues is more that in Solana, it's just hard to do this mempool like thing meet while meeting the latency constraints without revealing a ton of public information. That makes it even easier to sandwich more people. Whereas in Ethereum, you can actually do a lot of stuff to delay encrypt things, encrypt things in certain ways that might take a lot of time, but then people have a harder time front running you. And this transparency that has happened at low latency makes it just easier for sandwich bots to give you some context. Jitto, on the last day it was running, this had ten k solana in tips. So that sort of fees paid to validators to include your front run and background transactions in which at current prices is like over a million dollars a day, right. Like in just fees to validate, which is like, that is really quite high. That's like 500 million. It was like 500 ish million annualized per year. So, like, that's a lot of fees going to validators. And I, you could see the steady increase right, when the memes meme coins really took off. But to be fair, we actually saw a similar thing in Ethereum when Jared from subway ETH and Pepe were very popular. Right? And you saw like this huge increase. So I think it's just a natural thing that these types of assets just generally attract unsophisticated noise trading type of behavior. And so, like, it's just easier. And so I think, like, I don't think that they're kind of like, oh, we're never going to do it again. I think it's just they have to get implementation that makes sense."

I would argue that Ethereum has done similar things in the past when they had the centralized flashbots auction, effectively bought them time until the merge. And I think effectively MeV, because it's this dynamic game, especially in a permissionless environment where someone can introduce a new smart contract, it gets a lot of liquidity, and all of a sudden all the MEV migrates from one type of strategy to another. You kind of have to, when you're designing the system, you have to be a little more flexible because you might make some design trade offs that in production don't actually."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I think it's more, a little more like the order flow. Auctions in MeV share MEV protect, where you can send your order flow to these protected mempools, sometimes encrypted. And so people can't see all of your order flow. They get some information about the aggregate order flow before deciding to make their transactions. And I think when you have lower latency constraints, like you have to wait longer for box, you can actually run those more efficiently and make them more private. I think there's just a lot of design constraints, engineering wise, that you have to be very cognizant of. And I generally think if your philosophy is we have to have low fees and good user experience, perhaps at the detriment of validators, they have to run a lot more. You know, I think, you know, over time, I've come to the following kind of pithy oversimplification, but I think it. It's sort of a thing where I think, I think can give a listener who might not be super familiar with this stuff the easiest, you know, like Eli five, which is Ethereum, the protocol has users. The protocol views its users as validators, right? Like, it views the validators as the users of the protocol. Like, everyone should run one or everyone should participate, whereas Solana views the user submitting transactions as the real users. And I think Ethereum has this tension between who's our real user, the validator or the end user? And Solana is, philosophically, the validator is just a service provider. We don't really care that much about them, to be honest. I think when you have that philosophical objective, you get these different design decisions, but at a very high level. I think when you really care about maximal decentralization, maximum security, then it does make sense that your network is built around the validators are the customer in some ways of the protocol. And so I think this different philosophy also is kind of a thing that bleeds into this discussion. But I do think, I think there will inevitably be solutions figured out. I think actually, in fact, I think with a little more engineering work and design, I actually do believe that you could get to reinstating it, but in a way that doesn't leak as much information, though. And I think that's the thing to look forward to, is they're getting to that stage."

And if you put everyone through a pre built that has a different information flow, then, yeah, it could solve the problem.

The Den Koon is supposed to be scheduled for Wednesday. So I think by the time this podcast is out, it should be post den kun. But it's gonna be one of the biggest upgrades for Ethereum in a while. There are two upgrades that are happening simultaneously, a bunch of code changes, but the main thing that's gonna be happening is what's often called proto Dank sharding, which is going to include the introduction of blob storage. So this is the big thing that's supposed to make roll ups cheaper. Everybody is. Not everybody. Weirdly, people seem to be kind of sleeping on it now. It doesn't seem like a lot of people are talking about it, but I remember six months ago, it was all anybody could talk about was how excited they were that roll up costs were going to get cheaper. But there's now people who are increasingly concerned that, especially now with, as you mentioned, meme Coin mania and the amount of gas that's being spent on things that are not layer twos. I think actually, six months ago, more of the gas was spent on Ethereum was layer twos and Da. And now increasingly it's more just people trading random stuff on uniswap. And so there's increasing consensus that this may not have that big of an impact on fees. It may lower the fees for layer two s, but it's not very likely to have much of an impact on the fees for everyone else on Ethereum. Any thoughts or predictions about how this is going to affect the layer two game? And of course, by the time that this is launching, there's external DA, there's Celestia, there's avail, there's Nier, there's Eigen Da. And so there's a lot of different DA solutions now competing for people to post their roll up data there."

But because I do think there is kind of this, if you build it, they will come type of aspect of 4844 where there's a ton of people who are like, oh, I'm maybe building a l three, which is something that posts to l two, or I'm building something else. And if it actually is really cheap, then I start going to Mainnet. And I moved to Mainnet, right, because it's easier ux for the end user in a lot of ways. So I don't know, I think it'll definitely be positive. I think it'll push the DA layers to really have to optimize. But I don't think it's as big of a deal as people claim. I think there was a really good analysis a while back from Alex, from Zksync about how net bandwidth increase is not really that much in the current state versus the full dank sharding version. And I think the cool thing about the alt DA layers, because they all actually are taking different approaches. Like if I compare Eigen Avail and Celestia, is that they all are making different latency versus bandwidth trade offs in terms of how much communication has to happen versus how hard it is to reconstruct blocks, versus whether I use a commitment scheme or not. And I think all of those things are going to be the experiments that show you which one users prefer and which ones like the users here, meaning developers, developers, roll ups. And hopefully from those experiments Ethereum can kind of take the best combination and add it to mainnet. But it will take a while. So I think it's not as impressive of a thing right now than it was before all these alt Da layers came out. Because I actually think they, when you look at say like an application that has a lot of users, that's its own roll up, say like Avo, which disclosure I guess we're all investors in. Avo is like something where like they had real users. And the difference between the five x and, you know, or ten x more in fees is huge because there are perps, Dex, and volume is everything for them. Right. And I think it's going to be a question of like, do we have these apps that are like Solana, shitcoin, meme, coin trading type of stuff where, yeah, you need to be able to handle tons of volume, like Ava, or are they going to be slower things? And I think 4844 is sort of in this middle ground of like, it's good for these slower things. It's not necessarily going to be the best for, say something like an Avo and say, if Ethereum wants, I'm not saying ethereum as a community has a collective desire to want this or not, but let's say they want meme coins back, they want to relive the Jared from subway eth days, then I think 4844 is not going to be sufficient. There's certainly a ton of people on Twitter trying to be like, ah, all the Solana stuff will come back once we have 44. And that part I'm much more dubious about."

I think certainly not the arbitrum one or op mainnet type of roll ups, but certainly I think the other roll ups will inevitably have to make that decision. And I do think the Solana UX attracting a lot of new users is going to be very compelling for roll up developers. They're going to be like, how do we replicate that? I think that's the story for the Alt da layers because 4844 isn't quite enough. So I don't know if that's a prediction, but."

It's just sort of like, it sounded so good on paper, but then, look, there's so much risk and what if mainnet goes down and all the teams are fighting and Da seems to be, is it really that central to our story that we're the magical Da layer as well as the world computer? I don't know. Anyway, all right, this is besides the point. There are a couple other things I wanted to get to today. We've been talking a lot about the bull market. One of the interesting stories this week has been from the land of Makerdao. So Makerdao, largest decentralized stablecoin, they have historically they had $5 billion that was in total reserves in Makerdao. And Makerdao started freaking out because very recently, amidst all the bullish sentiment in the market, the Dai reserves ended up dropping precipitously from 5 billion to 4.4 billion a week. Now, why did that happen? The answer is that Dai savings rate right now is only 5% and people are like, yo, I can go make a lot of money taking this capital out of Makerdao and going and farming and doing this and that and blah, blah, blah. Makerdao announced that they were going to do an emergency fee hike to raise the dai savings rate from 5% to 15%, basically meaning that now it's going to be significantly more attractive to hold Dai. You're going to get paid more. And the interest rates, the stability fees, which are the interest rates you have to pay to borrow, were increased also very significantly to basically make it like, look, the cost of capital and crypto has gone up. Theres a capital shortage because everyone is farming and doing all this meme, coin trading and whatever. And so all of this happened very suddenly, very quickly, overnight. This caused the value of MKR to go up. Actually, I think it went up like 15% or something overnight, on realizing that Makerdao is now going to make a lot more money. But a bunch of people are also upset at seeing how quickly, all of a sudden the rate governance has moved without much notice to die holders or to MKR holders. It all seems very reactive, which I think is freaking people out. This is also very close to the four year anniversary of what you might remember was the DPEG that happened in March of 2020."

        "text": "Yes. I saw a lot of people were posting about what they remembered four years ago when that was the day that every market dropped 50% was also the day that Dai had a huge shortfall. So what's your guys take? Obviously, you guys are Tarun and Robert, you guys are different sides of the Defi wonks. And of course, Tom, you probably have strong opinions about this as well, being the Defi maven. What are you guys thoughts on makerdao jumping in and crazy runarounds on the interest rate?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, well, a couple of points. I agree with your sentiment that this hike from five to 15%, both in borrow costs and stability fees seems incredibly sudden. I feel like a good process or good governance would have seen this increase from five to 15% in a staggered rollout over a couple actions as opposed to immediately. I mean, to me and to most people on crypto Twitter, this was a shock, how rapidly rates were raised. And there was a lot of warning signs that rates would have to raise. I mean, we've seen, and this goes circling back to prior conversations, things like, Athena, there's interest rates of like 30, 40, 50, 60% across the crypto ecosystem. Right now, the basis trades for the cost of capital are showing that markets are valuing capital right now at still far above 15%. The fact that you have these basis trades yielding 60% shows you that right now the market itself wants to be levered long because of how rapidly asset prices are rising. And so one perspective is that 15% is not enough. And we've seen weeks of higher interest rates across the entire crypto market structure. And so first off, one way too sudden. This could have happened sooner and it could have happened more incrementally, even if they were getting to 15%. And two, I think the side effects of this aren't that well known. I think it's going to be really interesting to watch how this unfolds over the next couple of days and weeks. But putting your base rate at 15% is quite remarkable. And it is funny that it literally is four years to the day after black Thursday, when for anyone listening to this call who doesnt even know what that is, let me give you a quick synopsis of it. Asset prices fell by 50% everywhere. And a lot of makerdao CDP's were auctioned off. And because Ethereum and the mempool was so congested, nobody was able to bid on the CDP's or these vaults that created Dai. And so all of this Makerdao collateral was auctioned off for $0 and it created pandemonium. And today, makerdao actually looks very different than the way it looked black Thursday four years ago. Today, the system is not how most people remember it. It's not a system where all Dai is created through vaults owned by individual users that it's ether collateral or rap bitcoin collateral. And if the prices go down, it gets auctioned off. Most Dai is backed by what was called the peg stability module. And this was created as a response to black Thursday four years ago. The peg stability module said, hey, if there's a market dislocation and people want to get out of Dai, we can't assume that there's enough bid in the market to soak up that die. Why doesnt Makerdao, the protocol have a big bucket of USDC? So that when you want to sell Dai, youre basically selling it back to Makerdao, the protocol for a dollar of USDC and you dont have to have organic market demand to buy Dai. The second you want to sell it and you dont have this synchronicity between supply and demand for Dai. The stablecoin itself and the PSM has done a phenomenal job over the past couple of years creating Dai price stability. Unlike Black Thursday four years ago, the price of Dai has been basically a dollar since then. Why? Well, no one really wants to pay more than a dollar for a Dai, and there's more than enough USDC to sell it for a dollar. And so the price has basically done a phenomenal job being pegged to USDC. And really what's causing this dislocation is that the PSM is being drained. And so when you visualize what is Makerdao, the system, it's almost like it's slowly returning to its roots of like, hey, there's not that many stable coins backing this that are owned by the protocol. Instead, it's mostly volatile collateral. I mean, it's not like a black and white thing. But this problem of having to raise rates comes from the fact that they can't let it return to market forces on the price of Dai, especially when there's a decreasing holder base that want to hold die. And so it's a fascinating system to watch it play out. And honestly, these are slow moving trains and I think Makerdao can watch them in motion and take more predictive actions than what got us here with this five to 15 hike over the last couple of days."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, I think you said it right. I think people don't appreciate how much the interest rate environment in crypto has changed in the past two months. So in the post where they talk about sort of the emergency changes that they're making, they cite sort of aave tether borrow rates as an example of interest rates. And just for reference, beginning of February, 7, day average to borrow tether on Aave was 4%. Even before this maker post went up on March 8, the interest rate to borrow tether on AavE was 15%. Yes, I think people obviously expect maker to change rates more slowly as they have in the past, but the market is being very volatile and makers just reacting to that because they don't sort of have this bonding curve type type mechanism or amm type mechanism that most of these on chain lending markets do."

Um, the fact that even, just like the general cost of capital in crypto has gone up so much, um, the opportunity cost of holding certain assets is also quite high. So it's just sort of this natural crunch. I agree with Robert, though, that like, yeah, it was a bit sudden. Given maker's history, I feel like they're usually very gradual, prudent. This felt a little, like a little rushed. But I also, at the same time, kind of get the. No one wants to be in the position liquidity. Was that when they kind of had their redemption event issue? And I sort of think, yeah, they're being proactive about that. And that's a thing where it's like, the relative rate impact your stability. I. Yeah, I mean, I think it will be interesting when. If the market kind of calms down and, like, how do you gradually lower this down? That's, to me, on the way up, it's kind of easy. It's always easy to tell people that story. I think the on the way down is the part that is me. If they did this the other direction, I would be much more like, what the fuck happened? But on the way up, it kind of makes sense."

I mean, it was more of a bug. It wasn't that. Literally nobody could get into the mempool, but rather that their bots couldn't get into the mempool because they were misconfigured because of how expensive the gas prices were at that time. And I don't know, just hearing you recount that story, I just kind of had this twang of emotion."

In crypto, people have this, like, arrogance that's like, oh, of course, I'm the genius who came up which, I don't know, maybe that comes with the nature of the game, but it's kind of one of these weird meta observations."
