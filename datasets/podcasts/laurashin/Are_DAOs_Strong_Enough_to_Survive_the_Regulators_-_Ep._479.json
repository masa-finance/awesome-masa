        "text": "So before we dive into the meat of this topic, which is going to be super interesting, let's actually just define some of these terms, because Dao is one of those words that's been discussed a lot in crypto for many, many years, but it went kind of like from theoretical concept to reality. And yet there's many permutations of different daos. So now that we've seen all the different kinds of organizations that people are calling daos, how would you each define dao?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So I would define DAo as a decentralized, autonomous organization, which may sound trite because that is the acronym, but I think a large amount of the organizations currently call daos either are not decentralized or are not autonomous. So what is decentralized decentralized means that if there is discretionary authority of some kind, decisions to be made, that the power to make those decisions is very widely dispersed among, in my opinion, what should be a potentially anonymous global set of people. They may vote through tokens or they may vote. I consider bitcoin to be a Dow. In the end, the members of the bitcoin Dao vote with their hash power, but more often it's voting tokens, and then it has to be autonomous. And autonomous means that it is resistant to extrinsic exercises of authority. We decentralize the intrinsic power, we get rid of the extrinsic power. So that means it shouldn't depend on any particular company. It shouldn't depend on any specific group of people. It shouldn't depend on, for example, again, in my opinion, a state charter, a state license, and then it's an organization, meaning that it's some type of group of people who have gotten together to do something, whether it's to set the rules for an on chain protocol, set the rules for an entire blockchain system, whatever it might be. But usually it's technological and blockchain oriented."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And one question before we turn to Fatima, because just when you were talking about autonomous, and you were saying it's like impervious to external changes or forces or something like that, I forget the wording that you used. But basically that doesn't necessarily mean, because to most people, the word autonomous would mean you don't need to do anything and it just runs, but people need to vote. It's a very active sort of thing. But you're just saying only the token holders of that dao can act in it, and that's what makes it a token."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "That's right. Yeah. You try, obviously, with a lot of these things, we want to minimize the need to make decisions as much as possible. Right. And that, that is what is autonomous. It's like a robot, but with most of the. If it was just that, if it was purely that, then it would just be an autonomous organization, right. It would basically be a robot. The reason why it also needs to be decentralized is because there is still some flexibility and decision making and mutability that's involved. And so whenever you have that, that residual discretion, you want to decentralize that as much as possible."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. And fadame, what about you? How do you define Tao?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I like Gabe's definition. I think that it is maybe an ideal definition. The way Gabe, you just mentioned presented it. I feel like I would adopt an approach that is a bit more general and broad to encompass more of the realities that we have now on change. I would say that daos are just groups of people who are coordinating, organizing and governing anything. So either that could be the treasury, a protocol, anything else that may be governed on chain, and I would simply define this as a dao. So it's kind of the other extreme because I don't necessarily include any minimum level of decentralization, although it should be technically decentralized. So token based governance, for instance, or potentially be decentralized. But nowadays we don't have the tools to assess properly whether or not DAO is actually effectively decentralized or not. So I wouldn't even venture into these considerations."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So is there like some threshold at which you guys would say, like, something is centralized or decentralized?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think that what is centralized is. Could be pretty obvious. So if there is like a corporation that makes 100% of the decision, or can overrule, has veto rights over what the Dow governance decides, then I would deem that to be centralized. If there is one person or a very small centralized group of person making decisions, not being accountable to any form of token holders, for instance, I would deem that to be centralized. But other than this, I think it's an open question."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I would say that if a single person or a group of extrinsically affiliated persons has more than a majority of the means of determining consensus, or a majority, or more like the requisite minimum itself to determine consensus on a cosmos chain, that might be any group or person that holds more than a third of stake within that active validator set in. Some, you know, it might be like 51%. That's why it's called a 51% attack in bitcoin. But whatever that number is for the requisite system, if it's controlled by a single person or group of extrinsically affiliated persons, then I would say it is centralized."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So at this point, you know, like I was saying earlier, we have a number of different daos that have come into existence, and they're all taking different shapes and forms, and we're going to dive into some of the really specific cases. But I just wanted to hear, like, from an overview perspective, what are the main issues that you feel need to be resolved about daos right now when it comes to legal issues?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Well, there are many, and I'll try not to muddle it with other issues that daos might get pulled into. One is just what type of legal thing is a DAo? Right. Some people, particularly regulators and class action litigators are arguing that Dow is simply a partnership like any other. Right? Partnership is defined as an agreement to co own assets in the context of sharing profits and losses related to them. That's one potential. But there are countervailing considerations for some daos. Like, for example, some of them are highly rivalrous. In fact, if you consider bitcoin to be a DAO, and that was actually the first system that was called a Dao in the literature. It was called a DAc, a decentralized autonomous corporation. But same thing. Basically, if you consider that a DAO, well, the miners comprise that Dao and the miners are highly rivalrous with one another just because one, typically in a partnership, a rising tide lifts all boats, so to speak. But in bitcoin, a particular miner doing really, really well can quite adversely affect the other miners. So is it really a partnership? I don't know. Right. It's debatable, but there's no clear legal classification and it might differ depending on what dow you're looking at. Another issue is around who comprises a dow, right. Because in a traditional partnership, for example, a pure common law partnership, every time a new partner is added or a partner leaves, the partnership is dissolved and it's now a new partnership, right? So you would not be able to sue the old people who left for something that happens afterwards. But for example, in the CFTC's suit against Uki Dao, they seem to be defining that Dao as anyone who at any point ever voted in the dao on anything, right? So these are. That kind of gives you a flavor, I think. But there are many, many unanswered questions."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think it all goes down to a question of liability, basically. And this is a very practical view, if I want to be part of a DaO or I want to build a DAO, the question that I will be faced with, and also if I want to participate in the governance of one, is whether or not I'm going to be held liable at any point because of the DAO's activities, for instance, because of the DAO's lack of certain activities. So, for instance, that could be like, if the DAO is a defi DAO, can I be made liable for the fact that it is conducting its activity without being registered in a jurisdiction? For instance, will I be liable if one day there is a problem with the software and I somehow participated in the governance of that software? Will I be liable if jurisdiction all of a sudden decides that this DAO needed to pay tax in that jurisdiction and obviously did not do that. So there are so many different array of possible liabilities that are right now unclear. The way that most daos operate currently is that they either try to mitigate these liabilities through various means that are untested and oftentimes just maybe comforts Dow participant a little bit, but without giving any form of guarantees or basically, we have to find ways to either have risk tolerance towards these issues, but there is no certainty whatsoever. What are the possible liabilities faced by a participant? And I think this is something that needs to be clarified also, just for peace of mind."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. While you were talking, I was imagining, like, you know, what if a dao token holder would be liable if they voted to approve an upgrade, and then that upgrade resulted in a hack where everybody lost their money, then what? So, yeah. Anyway, so again, we're going to dive into some details of things. However, before we do that, I do want to talk about a new concept that Delphi Labs is unveiling and gave. You guys great with the language here. You call them cybernetic organizations, and then you shorten that to cyborg, which is, I guess, I don't know, somehow very in line with most crypto nomenclature. So what are these exactly? What are borgs?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, so the idea here is that, look, there are kind of two steps you can take to the issues that we've been discussing so far and that we'll further discuss, which is there's a lot of risks around daos, a lot of uncertainties around daos. One is to essentially, there are kind of two ways to risk off, so to speak. One is essentially, look, at the end of the day, these are just businesses like any other. Let's just create entities. If we need to create a new type of entity under law, like a Wyoming Dow LLC, let's do that. And let's just make these daos companies, and then everyone who participates in them will be like a member or a shareholder or something in that company. They'll get the typical limited liability package. They can do anything they want, just like people do with any other business, and they can have at least somewhat more reasonable assurances about what their risks are associated with that and so on. To me, however, that takes away the essence of daos, right? Because it's no longer autonomous. It's now a state defined entity, and you have to follow the specific rules that that statue has laid out, or else you lose the limited liability. And, you know, there can also be theories of piercing the corporate veil. Limited liability is never ironclad, even if you have an entity. What I actually think is better is let's stick to the real concept of daos, which is that they are basically robots with like a decentralized base of people who can give them very, very limited type of flexibility, right? And let's take all the business functions, all the management functions. If you're looking at something like Olympusdao, which is essentially a very complicated on chain hedge fund because it funded all these other protocols and took stakes in them and it sold tokens and then bonded them and it has this protocol owned liquidity. Or if you take daos that like directly try to pay higher workers, like hire full time salaried workers to, to develop the protocol. All these things that we think of as businesses that are highly off chain, that involve legal agreements, that involve a lot of discretion and potentially regulatory license, take them and put them back into entities. Put those into entities, not the entire DaO. But the way you can do that is you don't have to go all the way to the extreme of just saying, okay, their entities, like the Ethereum foundation, for example, is basically a black box to us. The ETH holders have no influence, really, except maybe social pressure, but no legal influence, and certainly no blockchain based power over how the Ethereum foundation spends its money, exactly how it governs itself, etcetera, let's take advantage of this brilliant on chain infrastructure that we've built, and we can create new legal blockchain hybrids, cybernetically enhanced legal entities, borgs, like the Borg in Star Trek where John Luc Picard gets the monocle and he's been assimilated, can be sort of merged with a DAO or with other types of on chain constituencies without being mere agents of them, but being somewhat accountable to them. So just for example, one thing you could do is, let's just say very popular right now is like token to token swaps among daos, right? They want to get synergies, they want to get value alignment. Like we work on a protocol called Mars protocol that's on a blockchain called osmosis. Wouldn't it be great if the Osmosis Dao owned a bunch of Mars tokens? The Mars Dao owned a bunch of Osmo tokens, and we were all friends in Kumbaya, but to me that's very regulatory risky. But what you could do is I could set up an entity that's adjacent to the Marsdao and that entity could own a bunch of osmo. We need to make clear to Dao holders that they're not the owners of this Osmo. They're not going to get profits from it or dividends from it, and they're not going to decide everything about it. But one thing I think we could do, for example, is we could commit in the governing documents of that entity, we could publish it, we could say, we will always keep that Osmo governed by a multisig, and everyone who's on that Multisig will be directors of this company. Furthermore, we will always configure that Multisig in a way where the Mars Dao can vote those Osmo tokens on osmosis DaO proposals. That's not really a regulated activity, that's not a financial thing, it's not distributing profits. I think we can do that. Right? So it's a direct on chain control that the Marsdao has over these tokens, even though it doesn't, like, own these tokens. Right. There's a. Or you could take, for example, emergency multi sigs is another application right. Now. You know, a lot of protocols have these multisigs that can halt the protocol in the event of an emergency, or they can change parameters in an emergency, whatever it is, because, you know, there's security risk and we're not fully confident in the code. But the problem is, if you have the power to halt the code in an emergency, the chain doesn't know what's an emergency and what's not. Right. So you also have the power to halt the code at any point. That's very bad. So in my opinion, the way to plug that hole is put that multisig in an entity and having the charter documents for that entity, we will only use this power in an emergency. And by the way, if we abuse it, if you hold 5%, 10%, whatever it is, of either the deposits in the protocol or the DAO governance tokens. And you think that we violated the rules of this entity, you can sue the entity and force it to come into compliance. Things like that, I think, can create a bridge between the off chain world and these on chain robots. That still is web three, still is accountable, and still is innovative in its way. It's not like it's just going purely back to tradfi, but that has a more. It leaves the DAO concept pure and has these adjacent legal hybrids being something other than a DAO."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Interesting. So it's almost like there's the part that's like, truly DaO, and then there's these, like, satellites that are more like DAO legal entity, and then. But sometimes they can be at odds with each other if, like, one perceives that the other didn't kind of follow through on its word."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Exactly. And so there needs to be accountability mechanisms. Right now. There's a lot of trust in people who have these kinds of authorities over the protocol, but the accountability is lacking. And essentially it's just reputational damage is the only thing. Right. To me as a lawyer, that's not enough. And I don't think that's really the crypto ethos. We have an ethos of not your keys, not your coins. The off chain equivalent of that is there needs to be a damn contract written down in words that's legally enforceable. So I'm trying to reduce the trust on the off chain layer as well."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And fadameh, what is your reaction to this proposal? I'm curious. It's very new. Gabe just sent this to me. I was like, this looks interesting, but what are your thoughts?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I find it pretty interesting to also compartmentalize the risk in such ways by having smaller entities. So one of my biggest criticism of wrapping an entire die in one entity is that it creates one single centralized point of failure. So if the treasury of the entire DAO is governed by one entity, then that entity has to respond to one jurisdiction and may be forced to basically, for instance, just seize the treasury or have other actions over the treasury that is not aligned with the DAO governance. So I feel that having these satellite entities instead of one is definitely positive. I'm wondering how, I mean, this basically deals with one aspect of the issue, which would be accountability of decentralized actors, for instance, multisig signers. But what about the liability of the DAO participants? Is there a way within this framework of borgs that this risk can be mitigated?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I think there are ways it can be mitigated. Number one, I think once you sort of do this exercise of putting all the businesses and stuff into entities, I think you've already de risked a lot right there. Then you're left with, okay, what does the DAO actually do? Let's just take a protocol governance DAo. Well, I think it probably, assuming things are set up reasonably well, probably it can adjust some parameters of the smart contract like variables, and maybe it can actually fully upgrade, like Laura mentioned before. Before. Maybe it can fully upgrade the code to the new version. What is that service? Well, it's not really a software development service. It's kind of like it's a protocol governance service. I think it has similar risks, maybe to Icon, which is the Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers. And look, they do get sued sometimes, but what they get sued for is violating their own rules and procedures. I actually think that, like, what the Dow is doing in this world is very limited. There's always going to be some risk of litigation. Even if you have an entity, there's still risk of litigation, and there's still risk that people will say, oh, you controlled it, so we're going to sue you personally, particularly regulatory stuff. So I just think at the end of the day, it is a trade off, right. You are taking some risk, but you're doing it to honor that autonomous concept. And really, the risks of just setting some parameters on a smart contract or deciding new code to adopt is relatively manageable. In tort liability, there's a doctrine called the economic loss doctrine. It says if someone was negligent and your only losses from that negligence were economic damages, you cannot hold that person liable in tort in the absence of a fiduciary relationship. So if it's clear that there's no fiduciary relationship, because the participants in the Dow kind of disclaim that and they don't promise anything. Right. And the losses are economic, which I think will be the case until a DaO controls a drone or something in the real world, which I would recommend against. You know, I actually think the legal risks are quite manageable, to be honest."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "We're working on some right now that are using Cayman foundation. So I think this is one advantage, though, of borgs. It depends what it's doing, because Caymans is quite good in that it has these memberless foundations, and it's basically zero tax unless you set things up in an incompetent way. So it's good for certain purposes. But then, on the other hand, it actually has a relatively strict virtual asset service provider licensing regime, and it also has fairly stricteen requirements on not being used as a tax haven for intellectual property monetization by companies that actually kind of have their, you know, their economic substance elsewhere. So, like, if you were doing an IP DAO, like probably like nouns Dao, you'd probably want like a Seychelles or maybe Panama, because they're more hospitable to IP. But on the other hand, for, you know, something that is just like a security multisig, you know, the Caymans might be appropriate. So you can cherry pick. Right and pick different things for different purposes, rather than this monolithic full DAO wrapper in one specific place."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So this is, you know, a proposal that you have. You guys are working on, but I wanted to kind of contrast where you'd like Daos to go with, you know, kind of some of the developments that have already happened. And already I hear, you know, some of you have criticisms of these. So why don't we just start with the Wyoming one? That's one of the states that have been creating laws to help Daos get some kind of legal recognition. What does that law say? And how good of a bill do you think this is?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Look, there have been some Daos that have. In fact, I formed one of the first ones. It was Medicartel Ventures Dao, and we called it a Dao, although nowadays I probably wouldn't call it a Dao, but it's essentially an LLC that uses smart contracts. You know, they make venture investments. Right. And we just used an ordinary Delaware LLC for that. You can do that. There is no problem with doing that because llcs are extremely flexible. You can basically write nearly any rules you want for them. But on the other hand, I think people just wanted it to be easier with less custom drafting. And so I think the kind of steel, man, why it might be good is let's create a specific type of LLC that's meant just for daos. That's the idea behind the Wyoming Dao law. Right. We have these Wyoming Dao llcs. It has some custom rules, like, for example, that you need to put in the. Like in the publicly, I believe, if I recall correctly, that you need to put in the publicly filed documents that form the DAO. What is the smart contract address of that specific DAO? Right. And there are some other rules around it you need to specify. Is it algorithmically managed or is it member managed? These are not requirements of a Delaware LLC, even if you use one for daos. So it just kind of sets more of a roadmap for exactly a good way, I guess, to form a DAO that is an LLC. But make no mistake, it is saying that a Dao simply is an LLC. Right. And that's where I think people might get thrown, because that means it's a function of state law that literally means that the secretary of state of Wyoming can declare that DAO dissolved. And there's even a rule in the thing that says if the DAO is inactive for a year, it's deemed dissolved. So what does that mean exactly? I think people, like, there are things that could surprise people with this, especially if they're very crypto native. And to me, it's just not really necessary because you can use an ordinary LLC if that's what you desire, if you desire to fully wrap your dow in an entity and you could just set whatever rules you want. Exactly. Custom to your specific thing, not have to worry that you're violating one of the specific requirements of this Dow LLC law."

        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, I totally agree with what Gabrielle said. I feel like basically all of the jurisdictions are who are into technology and blockchain based technology are trying to understand what daos are and understand it within their own language of the laws and regulations that they have. However, this language is not yet suited to understand and bridge with these organizations. Daos are a type of organizations that we never knew before, where anyone from anywhere physically can join a group and govern some assets or some other things. And this is basically unknown by regular state laws. So they are trying their best to basically either capture a market share, be attractive, and be pioneers in this field, but unfortunately, using old laws or old understanding is just bound to fail when applied to daos. So Wyoming has been like, there was small adoption, I think, like, last I read was around 400, I think to 500 daos registered over there."

        "text": "I'm going to double check after, but I'm pretty sure that these are the numbers I read. But nonetheless, I've rarely heard Daos being satisfied by this choice. So oftentimes they would opt for it either because they just simply need an entity and want to experiment with the Wyoming one because of very practical reasons. So they would need an entity to own some form of physical assets that they cannot do otherwise, or because they're just us based. And for various reasons, they need an entity and they would go for this. But it's not just a default option for Daos at all."

Back to my conversation with Gabriel and Fadame so, in the same spirit as the Wyomingdao law, Utah also recently passed a law that grants legal recognition and provides legal liability for daos. It calls them llds. What did you think of this version?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So llds, it's an interesting acronym. Limited liability daos, basically, Utah, to my knowledge, is the most innovative jurisdiction as of date with regards to recognizing daos as legal persons. So basically, the biggest pain point for daos and what we discussed prior in this episode is that they are not understood by jurisdiction as being legal entities or legal persons. So they are not able to sue, for instance, they are not able to, as one organization, own assets. And the participants in this DAO, whatever whomever we deem these participants are, because this is also not very well defined, are not necessarily protected by limited liability. So in case something goes wrong, there is a risk that a parchment can be sued for the entire, for instance, damage that is happening. So what Utah did is that they basically took the Kuala Dao model law, which is basically a piece of research that was published by the think tank called Koala I think in 2021, where it presented a framework, a legal framework that jurisdictions can just take the model law and basically pass it as a law within their legal system, and then automatically those that fulfill the conditions of this model law will be recognized as legal persons. So the model law is structured in a way where, through the principle of functional and technical equivalence, the conditions that generally need to be met for corporations to be recognized as legal persons are fulfilled by daos. So, for instance, a corporation needs to be registered in a public register, I think, anywhere in the world. And this model law looks at daos and sees, okay, daos are not going to be registered. And we don't want daos to have to go and register in a public registry of the state of Utah or New York or whatever. That is a lot of overhead and bureaucracy. But we look at the technology and we see that there is a technical equivalent for daos that are registered on a public blockchain. So by basically saying that daos must be, for instance, registered in a public blockchain and have this information disclosed on a public forum, we deem that this fulfills the same condition and policy requirements that usually nation states needs for corporations. Therefore, it should be recognized by the jurisdiction. So Utah took this model law, but adapted it because obviously there are a lot of points within that model law that are more difficult for jurisdictions or for politics to just embrace without any changes. This model law is made for daos and for the blockchain space and by the blockchain space as well. So a lot of people who worked on it are builders and are members of daos. And obviously there's very little compromise, therefore, on, for instance, issues of privacy. We have daos where members are pseudonymous or anonymous right now. And this model wants to preserve that and doesn't want to require every participant to disclose their identity. However, politically, this is something that is difficult for jurisdictions to just accept. So Utah took the model law, but what it did is that it changed some of the aspects. So, for instance, required a registered agent to be in Utah for the state DaO. So if a DAO wants to benefit from this law, it needs to appoint a person in the state Utah that can be basically in between person, between the public state and the DAO. And there's also some other adaptations."

So, yeah, I like the philosophy behind it. The tricky thing is that there's this desire to say, well, look, not everything that you just call a DAO should get limited liability. So let's try to carve out exactly what types of things we mean by DAo should get this limited liability. And as you do that, you start having words that describe the way a DAO should basically be. Then whenever you have that, those words are subject to interpretation and it just becomes a little bit of a tricky exercise. Is this really just creating limited liability or is it also functioning as a backdoor type of regulation as well? And to me, when you mix those two things, it doesn't really work very well trying to do regulatory things and give limited liability at the same time. I think those are two different functions, but maybe you could do it. But to me, I just always worry, okay, are we really getting this limited liability or is there some weasel room within the way things are phrased that someone can retroactively use to try to challenge whether that limited liability applies? And I think as soon as you tell people we have limited liability, they get sloppy. Right. They get confidence and they start maybe now, like really being like confidently treating this as like just a business that you run. And I just don't know that these really are meant to be businesses. I prefer for businesses to be run out of business entities and for daos to be daos. But I think, I'm glad people are trying out different approaches and I think we'll have to see what people do with these things, what litigation happens over these things, and it's going to play out over a long time and it'll be fascinating."

However, in that I think these efforts have been halted for now, postponed to next year. They decided to wait because Utah Dow act was pushed quite quickly and adopted, I think, 1 March, and it's going to enter into force in 2024. So next year. But New Hampshire decided to wait so that they can do a better integration of the model law. So I feel like there is definitely the need for a lot of these provisions of the model, the law to be tailored to the regulatory space in at least the US, which is rapidly also evolving. And all of the stakeholders have to be around the table for this law to be successful. So for now, New Hampshire is, I think, on hold."

One of the more surprising events involving daos from last year, Washington, that one court determined that daos could be sued. This was the Uhidao case. Although the facts and circumstances of that case are sort of unusual. Or maybe they're not. I don't know, you guys tell me. But can one of you recap what it is that happened with that case? And, you know, how the court determined that it could be sued?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Sure. Well, there's actually three legal actions related to Ukidao, right? So I just want to be clear. One is that the CFTC had an investigation and I suppose a claim against both the original BZX development company, the BZxdao, that ended up managing the BZX protocol that was created by that company and then the successor to the BZX company and the BZxdao, which was renamed as Uki Dao. Right. So the CFTC kind of brought claims for violations of the Commodities Exchange act against all of those people. The developers and the development company settled with the CFTC. We can talk about that settlement. And the CFTC then went on to actually file a lawsuit against Uki Dao. Then there is also, at the same time, a class action against all of those same players related to a hack of the protocol where users lost money. And all three of these things are relevant and sort of treat the DAO, as well as various DAO members as defendants. The core of the CFTC's claim is that Uki BZX protocol was a, you know, essentially a credit protocol on Ethereum and some other blockchains, including BSc, I believe, Binance chain, which enabled people to engage in leveraged trading on tokens. You could borrow a token and you could use that to lever up essentially taking a long position on the token. The CFTC says, well, look, you're only supposed to be able to do that on one type of platform, and that's a CFTC registered contract market. And so, you know, you guys were violating the Commodities Exchange act, right? And so, you know, the developers settled individually, their company settled, and then. But the protocol is still running, and there's something called UKi Dao that governs the protocol. Right? And so the CFTC decided to sue them as well. Naturally, the last thing you want to do if you're a DAO getting sued by the CFTC, and the CFTC might note otherwise, know who's a member of the Daoist, show up to court and say, here I am. I'm ready to defend the claim. Right. So no one is stepping up to the plate to actually defend this lawsuit. So a bunch of people, including Lexpunk and a 16 z and paradigm and some others, defi education fund, I believe, was the sort of the fourth one there, filed amicus briefs trying to kind of fill the gap there, make some arguments. Okay, no, you guys can't do this lawsuit. You can't serve, you can't properly serve process on these DAO members. You don't even know who they are. And the DAO is not even an entity. Well, we lost that, unfortunately. You know, the court said now this is just an unincorporated association of some sort. Like any other, it is an entity. Anyone who's part of this entity would surely be reading the governance forum. The CFTC posted a notice of service to process there. They know they're getting sued. They can show up to court if they want. They didn't show up to court. And now the CFTC is seeking a default judgment against the entire DAO. Hasn't named any individual members of the DAO, but it's seeking one against the DAO itself, whatever that ends up meaning. And then for the class action lawsuit also, again, the DAO has lost so far. The lawyers for, I guess some of the individual defendants tried to get the claim dismissed on the grounds that the DAO is not a partnership or on the grounds of the economic loss doctrine, would bar the claims. And at least at this very early stage, which was just sort of determining whether a cognizable claim has been made that can move forward potentially to trial. The plaintiffs have won that particular motion. There's still more. They didn't win the whole case. Right. But there's at least enough there that it can potentially go to trial."

Or will they say, hey, we got a judgment against the DAO. Let's go to the ISP for their website and say that their website is facilitating an illegal business. Shut it down. Let's go to whatever platform the governance forum is run on, say, look, their conduct is illegal. Shut this governance forum down. I think it's probably more likely what they're going to do than try to chase all these individual people who they may or may not know who they are, right.

And if the participants in the DAO governance are going to be liable for being part of said Dao. And I feel it's really interesting to wait and see also how, if there is a judgment against the DAO, how they're going to enforce it, because this is an open question right now and whether they're going to go after the most well known or wealthy known members of the DAO, or they will go after the front end and so on. So I think this will inform also a lot daos how to structure their activities in the future, knowing that daos usually are not bound to one jurisdiction and it's very fair game to try to identify the risk in one jurisdiction. So if, I think this lawsuit is in state of California, California, right. And so if, whether a Dow is linked to California and the US, it's federal."

So if it's linked to the US, then it has to take some actions to basically mitigate that risk that would pose a positive or a judgment against the DAO. What I think this does basically, is that it creates some incentives for DAO parties participants to start becoming more and more privacy centered and pseudonymous so that they cannot be held liable for something that either the DAO does or other participants in the governance vote in favor against us. And this can be actually quite tricky. So, for instance, if I'm a DAO participant in the US, I am also obliged to declare in my tax declaration each year all of the tokens I hold. So I have to basically disclose that I am the DAO partsman in that said Dao. And then I am basically doxxed to the us government as being someone who may be liable for it. So if there is a positive judgment, then it also creates this risk that people will have to either structure their holdings in a way that will not appear in their tax declarations or basically obfuscate those so that they are not held in some illegitimate way, I think liable for whatever happens on the Dow level."

But in some jurisdictions, unincorporated association actually means the same thing as partnership. So it can get very confusing in California in terms of like a service of process issues, because that was the issue that was being debated. Right. Like, can the CFTC, has the CFTC even given proper notice of the lawsuit to the Dow members? Right. And if the Dow is unincorporated association, then it has at least something sufficiently close to personhood that based on the relevant precedents, you can serve that association, and you don't need to serve every individual member of that association. Now what it has been used for in the past is sort of ill defined things like gangs, for example. Right. You know, like, the bloods are nothing like a company, right. But they, but they are an unincorporated association that is like sufficiently discreet where the government has decided you can serve process on that organization. Right.

I think this is just a curiosity for me that I'm following. I would just also encourage everyone generally with this topic to take a step back. There's a lot of anxiety in the space space right now because of all of the legal and regulatory developments that happen, and there's like daily news and it's very hard to follow. And usually the news is quite pessimistic, and especially also when we see cases against Daos and DAO members, that it's even more anxiety inducing for anyone who is trying to participate in the space experiment and also build. And I would just take a step back and basically say that no matter the outcome, there are appeals possible. It's not the end of the entire case. And at the same time, there are also legislative efforts that are deployed in the US and elsewhere to clarify the situation and to basically reestablish some form of equilibrium and justice and also clarity in the space. And basically whether or not daos are considered to be unincorporated association, I feel could be of interest. And people have to have that in mind when they are building the DAO in case there are conditions that need to be met for this to be an unincorporated association. They don't want that when they are building the DAO, try to address these conditions in a satisfactory manner, but at the same time, it's not the end of the world if it is, I think."

So just before we record anything, Gabe, you implied that this indicates that, like, the legal status of Daos was decided differently in these two cases, Uki and."

One had been dissolved before the lawsuit and one had not. And the one that was dissolved, you're right. The judge basically said, too late. It's too late to see this entity, the one that was not. However, the judge still sort of reviewed the merits of that claim. Now, again, it was an entity. It wasn't the Dow, but that particular entity does things that are currently done by the DAO. They got rid of the entities for a reason, and the DAO took over whatever they were doing. What's interesting about that case is that the activities involved in managing, governing a smart contract protocol, potentially creating a smart contract protocol, were at issue in that case because that entity had been doing those activities, and some people lost money in the protocol. It was over the Makerdao black Thursday incident, where a subset of vaults basically had their ETH auctioned off way more cheaply than they were supposed to, and they incurred, like, the people who got liquidated incurred a way bigger loss than they would have expected to. Right. That was the issue. And they basically wanted to say, hey, this protocol was designed in a negligent manner, or it was described falsely. Those are all issues that can also be faced by a Dow. If the Dow is setting the parameters negligently or upgrades the system, and it turns out the new code is bad in some way and people lose money, those are the issues. Right. And so what's interesting are those issues and the way it was decided, and the judge did apply the economic loss doctrine there. And unlike in the Uki Dao case, the judge said, there is no special relationship here. These developers never said, hey, we're looking out for you guys. We're gonna give you the best protocol possible. This protocol is awesome. And we're gonna monitor everything and we're gonna always be making sure it works. They never said that they did some stuff, and they may have been trying to make money off of the system in various ways, but it just doesn't, it just doesn't rise to that level of special fiduciary duty where it overcomes the standard rule under torts, which is that if you only incur an economic loss because of someone's negligence, you do not have a tort claim against them. If you want to have claims against this type of people, you need to enter into a special contract with them that gives you a. The right to claim a breach of contract or something. And people using DeFi protocols, not only do they not do that, but typically the front end or the web interface that people use to access the protocol. If you look at the terms of service, it actually disclaims all liability. It says as is where is we're not doing anything for you. Use at your own risk. Right. All those things. So that is the deal that people are striking when they use these protocols. It's caveat emptor. It's do your own research, look at the code yourself, or get your buddy to look at the code, or hire someone to look at the code. You're not going to go to the developer. So I think that case, although it was about a development entity, has a lot of implications for these types of lawsuits that could be brought against daos as well. And to me, it illustrates that although there are some risks, the risks are pretty manageable if you're careful about what you say, what you put in relevant terms of service. Don't over promise things. Just call spade a spade, keep the dows activities limited. And I actually don't think the liability risks are necessarily that high."

I mean, this is a very, very unfortunate situation, and I really hope that basically the two lawsuits that are brought now against this decision by OFAC to list the software as persons under sanction to be successful, I feel that this decision is basically, basically taking away a lot of our freedom to privacy and to assembly and basically a lot of the rights that we have away from, from anyone. So any us person. But also, unfortunately, the reality is that OFAC's decision regarding sanctions and generally policies in this field reach outside of the United States. So right now, if you are in Europe and you're not a us person, it will be way, much more difficult for you to take your funds out of tornado cash the way you would have done before, although this is not illegal there. But basically, whatever OFAC decides to put under sanction has ripple effects everywhere else in the world, and we should just not vilify privacy tech in this way. Privacy tech is, or any tech, basically, that the main narrative that is put forward to basically put tornado cash under sanction and also to go against privacy tech, is oftentimes it's used by, for instance, North Korea when they are loungering. The proceeds of that they obtain illegally through hacks or through extortion and so on. But unfortunately, I don't think that we should give that much power to North Korea to basically decide to use a software over another. And all of a sudden this software is helping them to launder money and no one else can use it. So basically we are at the mercy of their decisions and this is just not sustainable at all.

The CFTC still sued the individual people because there's a control person aspect of the law that says the people who ultimately making the decisions, they're liable even if they're operating through an entity. So it's just two different issues. You can use an entity to protect against commercial liability and some basic things, but when it comes to these regulatory things, they are just going to go after the people responsible no matter how you set it up.

If you're decentralizing because you're just wanting to evade regulators, then that's a different thing from decentralizing because that's like the best, you know, version of what it is that you're trying to build or, you know, whatever. So, so last case that I want to discuss before we go is obviously what happened with Mango. So mango markets had this market manipulation by Avi Eisenberg, who then went on Twitter and told the world that he had engaged in this quote unquote, highly profitable trading strategy, which the regulators determined was market manipulation. And what had happened was that he actually returned a big chunk of the money to the mango Dao because they had agreed with him that they wouldn't pursue legal action as long as he returned this money. So before we even get to like what happened in court, I was just curious, at that point in time, did you guys think that that agreement was going to be legally binding?"

They're trying to say whatever it takes to, like, give him some false comfort that he can keep some of the money lawfully and then give the rest of it back and he'll be okay. And I do not think that it would be an enforceable. Plus, it's a Dao as well. So there's all these questions like, if it is enforceable, who's it enforceable against? Every user of the protocol or just the people or the entire dao, which may not include all the users or just the particular people who voted yes in favor of the settlement. You don't know. You don't know. So there are many questions around it. And if I had to have guessed, I would have guessed no."

        "text": "I would take the opposite stance here. And I would say that if and when this decision is made according to the governance rules of the DAO, then I think that it must be upheld. And I don't think that this decision was. Obviously, it was a very. It was a challenging situation. There was a time pressure, there was financial pressure, there was a lot of stress involved in making that decision, but no one, I think, forced them to make that decision. The identity of this person was known at that point, so they could have just simply decided not to make any deal with this person and try to basically have law enforcement go against the person and attempt to recover the funds. So they made this basically, I think, informed decision to enter into that deal. Whether or not it's a good deal, I think this is a whole other question. I think it's a terrible deal. But then I feel like those who may be responsible for this are the ones who made bad strategic decisions or had bad negotiation or actually made decisions ahead that led to this exploit even being possible."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "There is some interesting nuance here, because ultimately, Avi, cleverly, I think, arranged it so that the users could be made completely whole. And only the treasury funds of the DAO, which had been raised in kind of like a sale of mango tokens, they had this insurance fund concept where they sold mango tokens, and then they had this, like, insurance fund that was controlled by the DAO as a result of that. Right. And in the end, only that value is what would be reduced and go to Avi. Right. Because of that, I think there is a stronger argument that it's enforceable. Right. Because it's kind of like the DAO agreeing to give its own money to Avi. Whereas if the users had gotten haircutted, I don't think there is really any agreement or implication of an agreement on behalf of users that because they're depositing funds in the protocol, they're empowering this DAo to, like, negotiate deals on its behalf. Right. On behalf of those users. Right. So that nuance, I think, does lead toward, you know, the reading of it being enforceable, more defensible than if the users themselves had been haircut."

        "text": "Okay. Yeah. Because initially, when you guys responded, what was interesting was, so I agreed with Gabe in the sense that I thought it would not be legally enforceable, meaning, like, I thought that a court would say, like, this is just bogus. Like, you guys made up this thing, and it's like, you're not a legal entity anyway. And whatever. I think that I thought the court would just dismiss it. But what I liked about Fateme's answer is, Fatima was like, hello. Like, who cares about the status if you are part of any group and you guys agree on something? Like, you should follow through on that. Which just makes sense from a common sense point of view. So it was just funny. Like, I felt like you guys answered it slightly differently. But what was interesting is that, actually, surprisingly, this judge disagreed with me and Gabe and went with Fatima and was just like, yeah, even though this isn't a contract between lawyers or whatever, this is legally binding. So I was curious for your thoughts on, you know, that judgment."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "You got to keep the procedural posture in mind here, right? Because it's not like a final judgment, but the. There was a mango development company was trying to act on behalf of the DAO to come in, and because a lot of people are suing Avi now. And so these guys, these developers came in and they said, whoa, whoa, whoa. I know a lot of people want money from Avi, and they're suing him and they want to throw him in jail and all this stuff. But he still has $30 million from us that he took in a hack. And we want a temporary restraining order judge to, like, free. I forget exactly what they're asking for, whether it was to probably just to freeze it, right, while this all gets figured out. And their main argument was that, number one, you know, he's. Look, the guy's getting sued for market manipulation in the attack that let him get this money in the first place. Right? So it was all legal. And number two, that, yeah, we, like, have this, like, settlement agreement that the Dow voted on, but, like, that was clearly duress. It was done under duress. Meaning it was coerced. It was not a real agreement. And the judge reasoned exactly like Fatima. He said, wait, you guys negotiated this? You rejected his initial proposal, and you made a counter proposal? That's not duress. Duress is like when you tie someone up and say, sign this or I'm shooting you in the head. That's duress. Right? You guys negotiated, it's clear, no duress. So. But it's just on a motion for a temporary restraining order. They could still ultimately win, like, on a full trial and a full consideration of the merits. Right. But you have to, to get that temporary restraining order, you have to show a high likelihood of success on the ultimate merits of your claim based on what you've given the judge so far and based on what he had right there, he wasn't seeing that high likelihood that rises to that standard, and he was not willing to give the temporary restraining."

And if it does get it, what's it going to do with it? Right. Is it going to try to go after individual people, or is it just going to use it as like a. Like a, like a cudgel to, like, take down their website or something? That's a very interesting one. I'm also interested just to see, because this is somewhat a game of cat and mouse, right? So what's going to be the adaptation here? Right? Are people just going to stop doing daos because. Because of all these lawsuits and things and find different ways to design protocols or. Or they. Or are they going to adopt the Borg approach, right. Of, like, minimizing what the Dow does and having more entities? How's the industry going to adapt? I mean, I can't really predict exactly where it's all going, but I'm here for it."

I think there's a lot that can be done by daos to make the space better and also to be more confident with regards to regulators when they are negotiating policies with them, and I feel like we should be more building rather than looking outwards for answers and solutions."
