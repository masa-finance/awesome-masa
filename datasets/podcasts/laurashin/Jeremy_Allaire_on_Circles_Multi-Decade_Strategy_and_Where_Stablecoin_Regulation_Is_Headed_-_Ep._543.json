        "text": "Yeah, it's been a while. Not out of any desire to not talk to you, because Circle has been making waves. And one of the most recent bits of news is that you've dissolved the center consortium that was managing the development of USDC and Coinbase now has taken a stake in circle. What was the impetus behind these moves?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it's really exciting. I mean, there are a few pieces to this. I think the first is, if you go back a number of years, we invented USDC and debuted it to the world just over five years ago. And when we created USDC, we had a vision for what a protocol could be for fiat tokens is what we called them. They weren't called stablecoins really broadly then, but some people did that could work on blockchains and that you could build something that would allow for interoperable value exchange built on these open networks. We had a big set of ideas, and we really thought about these kinds of protocols as things that would benefit from having standards around them. It was really important to us when we got started that we could develop those standards together with other industry leaders and have a shared stake in the success of a protocol like USDC. We were very fortunate in 2018 to forge a partnership with Coinbase. It was a really important strategic partnership for both firms to drive USDC in the market. As part of that circle was issuing USDC. It was sort of, we're the regulated electronic money transmission firm and issuing it, but we had a lot of ideas for how that could evolve over time. But also, most importantly, while there were regulations around what money transmission was and how a firm like Circle needed to operate, there were a lot of things about stablecoins in particular, that there weren't really regulations around, like how to hold the reserves, how to manage the security of the network itself, all these kind of governance issues, in a sense, that were needed and how to deal with law enforcement interactions and other things. And so we created center consortium with this idea of kind of creating self governance around a stablecoin, and published more and more of the policies of that and so on. Now, what's happened in five years? A lot of things have happened. So one is USDC went from nothing to being one of the most important digital currencies and digital assets in the world today. It went from very small to being a billion dollar plus revenue stream business today, but also, most critically, is really starting a few years ago, governments sort of said, well, we're actually going to govern this. We see stablecoins as part of what I refer to as the prudential regulatory framework, meaning the regulatory framework that the central banks and the major regulators of payment systems wanted to have rules around. And that was really key. And so coming back to the heart of your question, which is, as governance goes from kind of a self governance model to a government governance governance model, the quantum nature of this changed. And so working together with Coinbase, we looked at how do we make sure that circle can continue to build and innovate and do what we need to do as the issuer and operator of this, and do it in a way that is responsive to the regulations that are emerging all around the world on stablecoins and stablecoin issuers, and make sure we can follow those guidelines now that there are rules that are kind of out there, and also continue to have really strong aligned economic incentives to make this as widely successful as possible. And so a mixture of things there in terms of them taking a stake in circle, taking full on ownership over all of the development operations, USDC, but also making sure that this can work in the context of all these new stablecoin laws that are popping up around the world."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, you know, it's funny because when I saw the news, it sort of felt like the consortium model was sort of the crypto way of doing things, and that was appropriate for a time when, yeah, USDC was smaller. This was something that was really kind of more focused on the crypto community. But of course, now the conversation has just changed so much and we have, like, regulators and lawmakers that are really looking at this space. You know, there's probably going to be legislation about it. And so, you know, it felt like, oh, they're moving to a model that can fit into existing regulations."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, big time."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. I mean, something else that was interesting, which I'm sure you saw, is that the news of this arrangement caused some speculation that circle was setting itself up to be acquired by Coinbase. And I was wondering, as the CEO of Circle, which direction are you working toward when you're steering circle to going public or to an acquisition by another company such as Coinbase?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. We're definitely on the path to be an independent public company. We've had the benefit of having a number of strategic investors in the company over the years. More recently, BlackRock took a minority stake in the company as part of a broader strategic partnership between the firms. That was last year. Having a stake in a company can create really good product and value alignment, and that's really key and it's important. I want to make sure that Coinbase has a stake in our long term success in addition to being able to make money from USDC, I think that's a win win. But as a company, just to be clear, it's our ten year anniversary, so it's a fun year for us."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Congratulations."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Thank you. I say this often, but when, when we founded the company ten years ago, I made it very clear to my investors and employees that this is a multi decade journey to really realize the vision of the company. And when you think about where we are today, there's whatever, 100 some billion stablecoins in circulation. Yes, there's a lot of volume of transactions that are happening, but this has barely begun to penetrate the financial system. And so there's just an enormous amount ahead and a general purpose protocol and utility for dollars on the Internet. There's an enormous market to go after there, not just for the movement of money, but actually just having money represented and stored in this kind of form. There's $25 trillion of electronic dollars in the world across the different kind of formats of that. And so we're really quite small. And frankly, the utility of programmable money and the utility of a frictionless medium of exchange that becomes possible like this, we're just beginning to see the value of that. And so I would just say for everyone out there, Circle still, even though we're doing a lot of revenue and very profitable, we're an early stage company as far as concerned. I view Circle as an early stage company right now. And I think when I think about what I'm trying to do and what we're trying to build, it's a multi decade kind of strategy. And I think I'm excited to see that through and really to do that as a, I hope a very strong, independent, publicly traded company."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, one of the steps that's definitely going to take you out of the early stage development is that you recently announced that the largest ecommerce, commerce and payments firm in Latin America, Mercado Libre, announced that it's going to adopt USDC. So tell us a little bit about that partnership and what impact do you think it'll have on circle?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's very exciting. It's a tremendous firm that has paved the way for kind of modern commerce, and they play a really big role in payments as well in Latin America. And it's part of a broader theme that we're seeing around the growth in demand for digital dollars and demand for using those in markets where maybe local currencies aren't as exciting. And Latin America is definitely one of those places. But I think very specifically the first phases of this are going live in specific countries in Latin America. Ultimately, we envision that this will be very broadly rolled out. But I think it's important as we look at indicators of where we are in the adoption of stablecoins, that this is going from, oh, this is just used as something to trade on DeFi or this is just used for arbitrage traders or whatever."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "To speculation."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, speculation to. No, actually this is something that is fundamentally providing dollar store of value to people who need it, providing a very efficient cross border payment mechanism for people who need it. And these are major mainstream companies that serve hundreds of millions of users. So Mercado Libra has, I believe, around 200 million customers. And that's tremendous. And so we think about how do we grow the tam of wallets that can transact in USDC? Coinbase has over 100 million wallets that can transact in USDC. These kinds of partnerships really grow that, and there are many, many wallets that people use. I think Metamask has 30 million active users and they can all transact in USDC. As we see more and more wallets, these traditional kind of fintech commerce firms, digital wallets companies, and then all the new people building the next account abstraction, smart account wallet, that's going to be the killer app for making all this usable. As those things get built, it just creates more and more avenues for people to use USDC."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, and I want to talk about those tech developments. But before we move on, I just wanted to ask for the Mercado libre. So obviously, let's say I'm in Chile and I, you know, I'm going to buy something on Marcado Libre. It would show me the chilean peso price, but then in addition, would it have this price in USDC? Or is because like, is the consumer also recognizing that their price could be denominated in dollars? Is that how that will work?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I don't actually have the, like, the details of the user experience, exactly how that is set up in front of me. What I do know is that they have a lot of demand from their customers to hold and transact in dollars. And so this is really a really powerful way to move more of the store of value that exists for their customers into digital dollars. And then obviously, once you have those, the usefulness of them both within their own platform. But the power of all this, and the reason why stable coins are interesting in some ways in the first place, and USDC specifically, is because of the reach, because of the interoperability I want to live in a world where I've got a digital wallet and I'm in the Philippines and I know someone in Brazil and I know someone wherever. That's power of crypto open networks that you can transact over directly, peer to peer, interoperably. That's really the power. Know, I think that's ultimately the big unlock that comes from a partnership with Circle like this."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And you've tweeted that 70% of USDC usage is from out of the US. Is it, is that one of the drivers that people simply want to keep their savings in us, in us dollar denominated currency, or, you know, what's driving that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, well, it's a few things. I think the first is just the whole blockchain ecosystem, if you think about it, is highly global. We know this just in general, there's just huge amounts of the activity are in markets all over the world. And so to the degree that you need a trusted, redeemable digital dollar, USDC is a great option. And so it follows the overall growth of that international market as well. However, we've absolutely seen a major uptick in basically that demand for store value in dollars. And we've seen that in particular come from emerging markets. We've seen growth in emerging markets Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia, other places like this, where we're seeing just so many startups that are launching things and building partnerships with those major companies, major global companies as well, that are actually embracing this as a way to settle transactions. So that international dimension is very powerful and I expect that to continue to be the case. I'm sure we'll get to this in the conversation. But this ties into why should the us government care about dollar stablecoins? Well, it turns out that it makes digital dollars a powerful export product of the United States. That enhances the, the soft power of the country and reinforces the economic interests of households, firms and the government itself. And so there's a strategic alignment of interests between the proliferation of dollar stablecoins, especially ones that are well regulated and really try and follow the law and supervise and national economic interest and foreign policy interest as well, which is for some controversial, but it is a fact."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, and you're right, we will definitely unpack that because I know you probably have a lot more to say on that topic. But first, let's go back to the tech development circle. Just released a new programmable web three wallet platform that you believe will help businesses offer digital asset payments to customers. Tell us more about that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Obviously, we're really well known for USDc and the stablecoin that we offer on the other side of that USDC itself is a protocol. It exists as a dollar protocol that any developer can build on and plug into. That's happened all across Defi and wallets and custodians and all kinds of different products and services they integrate to that protocol. And then they know I have a safe way for my users to store and transact and settle dollars. So a lot of the success of USDC has really been built on working with developers and working with developers that are trying to create value and they need a trusted stablecoin built into that. But we see that we can do a lot more as a company. Last year we did a multi hundred million dollar acquisition of a company called Saibabo that had really, we thought, really outstanding technology for deploying on blockchains, managing and deploying smart contracts, handling wallets and wallet security and all these things. And we got really excited about this category that was not yet emerged, but I think is now emerging of web three services. The analogy is Amazon built their own e commerce infrastructure and they said, hey, what if we took the infrastructure that was behind that and we started to make that available to developers to build on top of? So web two developers could bring online an application really easily and that gave birth to Amazon Web Services. And so when you look at if you're a startup or you're a big company or whoever you are, and you're like, I want to build an app that integrates on top of blockchains. I want to not have to worry about managing the infrastructure of that and the security and the operations and the compliance, the really hard problems. I want to just focus on delivering a delightful end user experience that is safe for the users and safe for me as a developer, that's a big need. We all talk about developers. There's lots of discussion about developers on blockchains and the developer ecosystems on blockchains. That's a really important thing. As you know, we have. USDC is rolling out on six more chains. We could talk about that too. But the bottom line is the number of developers that are capable of easily building an app that integrates on blockchains and makes it safe for their users to hold, whether it's an NFT token or a stablecoin, and making a payment. The number of developers that can do that today is tiny. There's 100 million developers in the world that can write software. There's about a half a million that are able to build on blockchains. And if we want to see web two go evolve into this new architecture, we have to dramatically change how easy it is for these developers to build, operate and run these kinds of apps and services for us, we see that as a huge opportunity. It's super aligned with what we're doing with stablecoins, because at the end of the day, if, whether it's a commerce app or a financial app or a consumer app or whatever it is, all of those apps are going to need to use money and they're going to need to move money. We can make it super seamless and take advantage of breakthroughs that are happening in blockchain infrastructure and evms and other abstractions which we can talk about here as well. We can make that so simple that it just proliferates the number of useful apps and we want to grow the number of useful apps. And if we grow the number of useful apps and they're plugged into our, into our, into our protocols like USDC, that grows the network and it grows the network utility. And if we can do that, that will generate a lot of value for us. And so this is a new revenue line. Like we're monetizing it like AWS, it's like pay as you go, it's utility pricing. And like if there's a huge, you know, a hugely successful app, we can generate a lot of revenue, but it's very affordable. You can just get in and go and it's truly self service. And so it's actually going back to my own roots. Not a lot of people know, but I started my career building developer platforms, programming languages, some of the most popular web development tools ever in history. I was the creator of back in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. And so I love these kinds of products and I think it's a really important moment. And I think it represents a shift in who circle is as well, from sort of the stablecoin issuer to being more of a platform oriented business in this whole Web three space."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I imagine it's probably a little bit more fun for you than the regulatory stuff. It's just my speculation, but I wanted to ask about the blockchains. You're adding six new ones, you said. Is that driven by demand that you're seeing like developers on that side, or defi builders are saying we need this? Or is it you saying, we just want to make sure that if any of these take off, that we're going to be there? How are you making those decisions?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it's a little. A bit of both. There are obviously, hundreds of blockchains out there, right? And we're not going to go and launch native USDC on hundreds of blockchains. There are many of those that are. There's like a lot of dead chains, right? And, you know, I'm not going to name names, but like, you know, there's a long list and there's people, like, I mean, how many new op stack layer two s are launching? Like, there's all these, right? There's. There's so much proliferation. What's clear to me is that, like right now, there's still a lot of ongoing innovation happening in both layer one and layer two. Given what I've just described in terms of the actual number of apps and the actual number of users of those apps, we're still in the early stages of the maturation of that. But it's very likely that in the coming few years, you're going to start to see some power law curve type of adoption and you'll see maybe there'll be five different layer ones and layer twos that take up, whatever, 80% of the market. But right now there is a lot of innovation and competition and there's completely new architectures that are coming out and there's still really hard problems to solve around privacy, security, scalability. There's still hard problems to solve that haven't been solved. We want to be omni chain. We want to make sure that if there is an infrastructure that has a strong technical innovation and has some amount of developer traction, or we believe is going to have developer traction, we're going to work with that and do that. A lot of it reflects that and we're not done. We're going to continue to be omnichain and experiment with that as well. But at the same time, the other products that we're building are designed so that you could build an app that is multi chain as well. So our web three services and smart contract platform and so on will target multiple chains. And then we're also trying to solve interoperability issues as well, which is a huge issue that exists in a world where there are multiple layer ones and layer twos and no one thinks that's going to end. We've really had a horrible, horrible way for people to move their dollars around, which is these bridges. You have all these bridges and the bridges, basically you'll lock the USDC and then wrap it, and then there's like a wrapped version of USDC that's moving on these bridges. It's slow, it exposes these huge honey pots for hackers. And so many of the highest profile hacks have been of bridges, basically, where there's been like, the developers have a multi sig and someone gets a key. I mean, it's this awful, and we're talking about like a billion dollars. It's terrible. And USDC is in fact the most bridged asset in the whole ecosystem. USDC is the most bridged asset. And so we built and launched a cross chain transfer protocol for USDC that it's called CCTP. Basically allows a user or a developer building an app, but just say we'll call it a user to actually teleport USDC from one chain to another without a bridge, without locking these, without any incremental fees. You're not paying for a liquidity provider to make that transfer. And we're able to do that because we are the canonical mint of USDC. What that means is if I have USDC on arbitrum, and I want to send that USDC on arbitrum to a wallet on base, or optimism, or on Ethereum main net, I can teleport it directly and it will burn the USDC on that one side and it will mint the USDC on the other side. So it's faster, safer, and there's no capital inefficiency. It's a huge way to provide, like, safe, interoperable digital dollars. And it is an abstraction that allows end users. If I'm an end user and you have a wallet and I have a wallet, I don't really want to care about what layer one or layer two you're on. I just want to be like, I have USDC, I'm sending you this and you send it back. It should just work and it should be safe. And that's what this allows. We're also, in addition to innovating and bringing us to see, to change the protocol developer and we're building new protocols that make it safer and easier for people to use these digital dollars on these networks as well. And so, yeah, I mean, we're excited. We launched, we launched these new chains, some of these new chains last week, and we launched more routes, as we call them, for CCTP as well, last week. And so it's all part of just making this the most useful, safest digital dollar on blockchain networks."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So all of that is super interesting. Circle faced an existential moment earlier this year when $3.3 billion of its reserves were locked in Silicon Valley bank, which then failed. Since that time, USDC has been losing market share against Heather what has been your strategy to recover from that event?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, there's a bunch of pieces here. I think the first is just to understand how our infrastructure works. And I think one of the key things that we do take a huge amount of pride in is the fact that we have the most transparent disclosures in terms of our market infrastructure. So we disclose all the banks that we work with. We disclose the details on every single bond treasury bill that we hold down to the serial number, down to the date. And we actually right now have, about 94% of the reserves are held in an SEC registered and supervised structure called the Circle Reserve Fund that Blackrock manages. And you can go to, if you search for USDXX, the ticker, you can go and see within that on a daily basis, every single thing there. So you can understand exactly what the safety of this is. And that is a compliant registered infrastructure. There's no one else that has that in the market. And so we have a very, very high degree of safety and transparency that comes from that. The second piece though, is sort of just thinking about what happened. I think there's some pretty dramatic things that happened to the whole industry. And obviously we were unique in that our own specific exposure in terms of a bank, a large publicly traded bank with $170 billion of assets over the course of a 48 hours period, went through an extraordinary run that had nothing to do with crypto. That was a run that happened when there were essentially disclosures that they had taken huge losses on their own balance sheet and Goldman Sachs was unsuccessful raising money for them. And so I'm happy to take you through what happened there, but that was a shock that affected the entire us financial system. And still we still have banks that are failing on a regular basis for similar reasons. But up until the day before the SBB bank failure, they were one of the very well rated a rated financial institutions. And so it was a true shock to other than certain hedge funds who had been shorting them. It was a huge shock. The other thing I would say is that we have always sought to keep up leveling the market infrastructure that sits underneath USDC. That meant having more and more redundancies in terms of the banks that handle the transactions that allow us to see the flow. Just to put it in perspective, in a matter of ten days, you saw basically three bank failures happen. Two of those banks that failed or were seized were like the critical banking infrastructure for almost every firm in this entire industry. You literally had overnight, virtually overnight, you had 5000 plus companies around the world debanked. And there had been this growing pressure from us regulators on banks in general, and that is ongoing. But you literally had like 5000 plus companies debanked overnight."

        "text": "But do you mean crypto companies or just."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, digital assets companies? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Crypto and digital assets companies that banked with companies like Silvergate and Signature. Right. They were just boom, like gone. Now, we had been doing a number of things prior to all this. One was we put in place. We created the circle reserve fund, which we did in our strategic partnership with Blackrock. And we had effectively. By Q one of this year, we had moved over 80% of the reserves into that. Within the stablecoin space. For the first time ever, you had an SEC registered and supervised structure with all the protections that it includes, with daily transparency into the safety of that. That's extraordinary. And again, this is a level of safety and transparency. Now, we also continue to maintain around 20% in cash, so that we always could meet whatever the most extreme amounts of daily liquidity needs that there could be. Now, as you're aware, if you're in the digital asset industry or you're in the crypto industry, it's not like you can just go and open bank accounts with whoever you want to open bank accounts with. It's extremely difficult to get banks and so it's also extremely difficult. A company like Circle, who's been compliant from day one, does things the right way, super transparent, has all of this capability in terms of risk management. It's not like we get to choose, hey, JP Morgan, will you hold our reserves? It doesn't work that way if you're Microsoft. Yeah, you can decide which bank you want to put your cash assets in, but that freedom doesn't exist. However, we had been making huge strides in progressing our ability to use what are often called g sibs, globally systemically important banks as the infrastructure behind USDC. In fact, we had just begun doing that for cash for USDC, literally in the week or two prior to the SVB collapse. And so we were actually very fortunate, even though all this stuff happened, we were very, very fortunate that literally we were able to sweep everything into the safest GSIB in the world. And you can go and look at our attestations now, and you can look and see that all the cash is with the safest, globally systemically important cash dollar cash custodian in the world and in this trusted reserve fund structure. And so on the other side of this, we literally have the safest, most transparent digital dollar on the Internet today. There isn't something that has that level that's there in terms of what we're doing about it. We're just continuing to do what we have been doing, which is continue to uplevel the market infrastructure to up level the transparency and the like. And the other thing I would say is the debanking that's taken place for this entire industry, the effects of that are still ongoing. I mean, it's become, as you probably are aware from many people that you talk to, it's become a major issue. What we have been doing is we've made a huge investment in basically building a global liquidity and settlement network for USDC. We're really excited about the progress we're making. We are bringing online banking partnerships in every major region of the world with high quality banks that will allow for the creation and redemption or the liquidity of USDC in those local markets as well. So you're not dependent on Us banks for that. So we're making huge, what I consider to be just like market infrastructure investments. And the only reason we can do all those and that banks will work with us is because we are a compliant, transparent, risk managed company. Some of our competitors, no one knows anything about any of the banks and they never have. And it's just a huge mystery. And there's liquidity issues that exist and it's not clear how you actually redeem. That's terrifying. It's terrifying. If we're talking about the future of the financial system, totally shadowy things that no one knows anything about other than public pronouncements, thats really tricky. Other things though, I mean, look, bottom line is weve been impacted by a perception that was really in the aftermath of this multifaceted banking crisis in the US and the shuttering of banks in the US, and a wave of SEC lawsuits against almost every major us crypto company. Knock on wooden this huge set of things that happened over the course of, in a concentrated way over the course of about eight weeks. And the rest of the world's reaction was it's not safe to be exposed to the United States. It's not safe to have money in an institution that is exposed to the us banking system. It's not safe to be working with firms that are the under the supervision of regulators in the United States. It's actually not safe. And so what we have seen is a flight from safety, and that's been pronounced like there's been a flight from safety. And in fact, other companies will tout like we're not exposed to us stuff and that's not tenable over the long run, right? That is not tenable over the long run. And if you're up close to these issues, actually theres tremendous progress being made. The Fed actually is coming out with a supervisory framework for banks that deal with crypto. Theres clear rules that are merging around stablecoins. Theres major financial institutions that are deepening what theyre doing here. The opposite is ultimately true. And I think that that flight to safety, that will ultimately be the case. The other thing to note, though, its really important is we also have a cyclical business. When interest rates were zero and there's just massive amounts of capital flowing everywhere, including into crypto, that created an environment where if you had dollars, you could go and go after all kinds of investment and other activities in the blockchain ecosystem. You saw this huge growth in stablecoins and we benefited from that. Now you've had these huge increases in rates in a speed that we just haven't seen in decades. And so the inverse is the case, right? If you're sitting on a digital, on a dollar asset and you know, you can go and get five and a quarter percent somewhere else. If you are a customer who has access to the us banking system and the tradfi system, you're going to do that. It's just obvious. And in fact, I have a chart, maybe I can send it for your show notes. But basically, if you look at effectively stablecoin supply, where it was in April of 2022, which is when the first rate hike happened, and then rate hikes, they're directly inversely correlated. But we're actually in this funny position where coinbase and circle have great banking, relatively speaking. And we actually provide a way to redeem one for one, at no cost into banks. And so we have the tradfi layer. And that's part of why people love USDC and part of why they trust this product as well. But that also subjects to being kind of the off ramp as well. It's like, it's harder to offer certain other products, but it's actually quite easy to off ramp through, through USDC. So we've had that as an impact. But I would say the broader impact is truly macrocyclical, which is in a high rate environment. Yes, we're generating significant amounts of revenue, and we just publicly disclosed our full year last year and our first half, revenue and income and EBITDA. And it's very significant. So despite our circulation issues, we're seeing very high year over year growth and cash flow as well. But it is this macrocyclical piece, I think Im taking a long term view on this, which is build the best infrastructure, build the most compliant, regulated infrastructure, build the best banking infrastructure, the most transparency, do things the right way, make it work. Make it work for any company, any fintech, any Fijde, make that work, build great things for developers and the rest will follow. And the macrocyclical piece is going to be there. As interest rates come down, you get to a neutral interest rate environment and then what people do with their dollars starts to shift. It's worth noting, since interest rates started going up, banks have lost a trillion dollars of deposits. You can look at the chart, that's this Federal Reserve data, the Fred database. You can look it up. From April of last year till now, banks have lost a trillion dollars of deposits. Money market funds have gained about $800 billion. And so it's the same phenomenon that's at work there as well."

        "text": "I'd say a few things. I think first of all, as the day they launched, I was, I think, quite complimentary and congratulatory to PayPal and Paxos because it's a good partnership for Paxos. And I think it's wonderful to see a major mainstream payment company embrace dollar stablecoins. And so we're excited about that. Just from the perspective of I think this is a very clear indicator that theres enough regulatory clarity in the world around stablecoins that major companies are getting into this market. And as regulation comes into place, thats exactly what you want to see. You want to see an open, free, competitive market. And as that regulation becomes available, theres a baseline of safety thats there as well for the market that everyone can depend on, and you'll see a lot more competition. So we fully expect to see more competition, not less competition, not just in the US, but around the world, because stablecoin laws are dropping everywhere. But first of all, I think that's just, from an overall perspective, a positive thing. Now, in terms of how do we compete, I focus less on the competitor and more on what are the things that we do that we think are really valuable and important that people will depend on. The part of what has made USDC so successful is that we're a market neutral infrastructure company. We're not competing for merchants, we're not competing for retail users. We don't have a consumer wallet. We are purely a market neutral infrastructure company. We think about USDC as a dollar utility for the Internet, and we want to work with tons of different companies to build on top of that. And I think that makes us unique. I think PayPal has a lot of great partners as well, but they have a franchise they have a franchise charging fees to merchants to collect payments using credit cards, and they have a franchise of end users. There are lots of people who would view that as competitive. We've been able to build great partnerships with lots of firms who might view each other as competitive. Robinhood and Coinbase probably look at each other as competitive. We have a partnership with block, we have a partnership with Stripe. We have partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, with MoneyGram, with a lot of different firms that are depending on and using USDC in different ways. And it's, I think, our market neutral position that is really important. So I think that's going to continue to be important as this grows. And what's exciting to me when I look at where we were a few years ago compared to where we are now, it's obviously enormously different. But even just like twelve months ago, the range of mainstream companies that are engaging on this and who are working on things with, with USDC, it's totally night and day. And so I'm really excited. I'm really excited as we launch partnerships in the coming quarters because we're just sort of seeing like the Mercado Libre examples just is a great one. That's like, that's a company with 200 million users. PayPal has, however, 100 million. Coinbase, a great partner of ours, has 100 million USDC supported in the binance wallet, they have 100 million users. So we have reach and we're continuing to add great, great partners that have reach. And that's what's important. What's the reach that's there then? Our strategy is really different. We're building developer platforms, we're building infrastructure platforms, we're building protocol layers, and that's how we want to grow this. We feel good about our position. We think we can, we can continue to be a very meaningful part of the market, but we welcome the competition as well."

        "text": "All right, let's finally turn to regulation. In late July, a stablecoin bill that many had anticipated would receive bipartisan support instead moved out of committee in the House, supported only by Republicans. Around that time, you made some remarks to the House Financial Services Committee on ways that you thought this bill could be improved. Before we get to your specific suggestions, tell us what you like about the bill."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So, I mean, I think a couple of things. First is the bill did move out a committee with bipartisan support. It wasn't broad based. It was definitely with bipartisan support, but not, it didn't have ranking member waters on board. Right. There were five Democrats that voted alongside the Republicans to move it out of committee. I think the bill accomplishes a lot. And my view, I'm very up close to the issues here and very up close to the politics here as well, which is that. What's really interesting is that this is a piece of legislation that everyone wants to get done. The Fed wants it, treasury wants it, Congress wants it, the White House wants it. It's a priority that has been set by the highest levels of the administration that we need to have dollar stablecoin regulation in the United States. So it is a national priority and people are working hard to get that done. And the US, just to remind people, the US led the way globally to go to the G 20 and say, everyone here, everybody at this table, all of you guys and gals, all of you nations at the table, you need to have stablecoin regulation in place. And they all agreed, we're all going to put stablecoin regulation in place. They agreed on the principles of it. And then they went off to their governments to say, okay, let's go get it done. Hong Kong's getting it done. Singapore's getting it done. Japan's already got it done. The EU has already got it done. The UK is about to get it done. It's getting done. So people are doing what they said they do. The US has a little bit of a longer legislative process, but everyone wants to get it done, which is great. So the probability of there being stablecoin regulation is high. The specific bill that came out of committee I don't think is the bill that will be signed into law because there are key things that are still important to the administration and to the Fed that just haven't quite been resolved. And so a lot of this has to do with how much of a role does the Federal Reserve play in not just setting the standards. So right now, the bill that went out of committee, basically the Fed sets the floor. They say, here's all of the requirements and they define that. But I think there's a debate over, like does the Fed get to veto who gets a stable coin license, or does the Fed have any specific supervision if it's a state, like New York state issues a stable coin charter to someone? And does the Fed have any joint or dual supervisory role? It's kind of technocratic, but it's actually really important stuff that has to do with states rights and federal rights and the balance of power and the like. But it's like down to those kinds of issues. But overall, what I like about it, to get back to your question is, it creates a clear pathway for bank and non bank stablecoin issuers. It creates a role for the states and the federal government. It sets a very clear and very high bar on the prudential supervisory requirements. It's very specific about reserves, transparency, risk management, all the things that are needed. And it effectively creates legal certainty that a dollar stablecoin is a part of the global financial system. It is a part of the US dollar financial system, which will mean that accountants know how to deal with this, whether you're a public company or a private company, that financial institutions will be able to hold it just like cash or collateral. And so it will unlock massive mainstream usage of this, as that happens. So there's a lot to like about it. And I think it would be interesting to see. We're just getting back into the congressional session. It'll be interesting to see how this moves in the Senate and as well through the House. But we remain optimistic that the United States is going to ultimately do the right thing and preserve and protect the interest of the dollar on the Internet. As I've said many times, the future of currency competition is technological competition. And it's technology on the Internet that is driving that. And it's a question of, are you going to unleash open networks, free market competition, private sector innovation, private sector technical innovation, which is what the United States has historically done to compete. And that's why the american Internet and technology universe is so strong. And they have to make that choice. Do you want to compete that way or follow the way of authoritarian regimes that are trying to build monopolistic systems over money?"

And I think that's sort of implicit in some of the economic philosophy that undergirds even things like bitcoin, like austrian economic philosophy, is sort of, you can't full reserve, you can't fractionally reserve bitcoin. I mean, you could do it like maybe Sam Bankman Fried did it."

        "text": "If you have a database and you're telling people you have an iou. And you could do that, but at a physical level, bitcoin can't be fractionally reserved. But the idea of a full reserve banking system is something that I've been passionate about for a very long time. And there's a similar economic philosophy that emerged after the Great Depression, when bank failures cascaded across the United States. There was a big debate about, well, how do you deal with this, these banks that were all going under, and there were two options that were very seriously discussed. One is called the Chicago Plan. And that was a group of prominent economists, Irving Fisher out of Chicago school, but many, many others, that basically said, we need to have a separation between the payment utility of money and lending, and we need to have full reserve money. And so it's still sovereign money, meaning it's still like a government obligation, but it's fully reserved. And banks can't create money themselves. They can't fractionally reserve. They can lend, but only with money that's fully reserved. And that was a big argument. And the argument was that that would result in a safer financial system where there's less inherent risk and less tendency to boom and bust, and would likely lead to fewer recessions. Well, there's another view, which was actually the view of the banks, which was, no, no, no, no, we want to be able to do fractional reserve, but let's just create an insurance pool, and we'll have an insurance pool, and the insurance pool will basically, we'll all chip in insurance, and if one of us fails, then we can draw on their insurance and pay for the failures. But we get to do this risk taking stuff. And that was the formation of the Federal deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC. So I think commercial interest won out then, and that's been revisited over and over throughout time. When the savings and loan crisis happened in the 1980s, again after the financial crisis for 2008, that's when I took a real interest in all of this, is what got me into crypto, was, how does this fractional reserve banking system really work? How would a central bank money, how can we improve on this? That's what got me in all of this. Before I even knew about bitcoin, it was sort of, I was interested in all this. So I've always wanted there to be a model for full reserve dollars. And I believe that if you have the technological superpowers of blockchains and the Internet, and you have this incredible programmable money that moves at the velocity and speed and efficiency of the Internet, that the ideal underlying basis for that should be a full, full reserve money. And that it should either be in like it should be government obligation money. So it should be either like cash held at the Fed, or kind of short term government obligations like treasury bills. And that if you had that, then everyone would know this is as close to cash as possible. This is like the safest thing as possible, and they'd be willing to use it very, very broadly as a medium of exchange. And that's really what we strive to, and we're really close to that. The only thing is, right now, the cash piece of what we have, we have to hold it in commercial banks. And I've always been nervous about that, and that turned out to be something to be nervous about. And so now we are fortunate in that we're holding the cash almost entirely with one of the very safest, globally, systemically important banks in the world, which means it has a government backstop behind it. So we have still a very safe place. But I do think the proper design on digital dollars and private sector intermediated digital dollars, which is what we're talking about here, is something where you can take advantage of that central bank facility."

And honestly, some of your comments earlier where it felt like you were throwing shade at tether without naming them, and maybe what you were thinking about, you were talking about these, quote unquote, counterfeit dollars.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I mean, I think if you know, to quote, to quote and literally quote Jay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is like, his view is that stablecoins are dollar money creation. And that is, that is the responsibility of the federal government to define what is legitimate dollar money creation, what is actually considered a dollar instrument in the global financial system. And I think in particular, if it's something that is determined to be equivalent to cash, that from an accounting perspective, from a balance sheet perspective that everyone understands that way there ought to be a very, very high bar. And if you're out there saying you're a dollar and you're not meeting the standards and requirements of the law to be a digital dollar, then you shouldn't be able to be out there parading as one. And so that's, I think, more or less the view. And so my own view is that there need to be consistent prudential standards for these fiat stablecoins around the world. And I think you're seeing that. You're seeing that it's basically the central banks in all of these major g 20 jurisdictions. They're basically all coming to the same conclusion. And the law is basically quite similar in all of these places. And so I think over time, we will certainly be in a world where if you're offering a digital currency, a fiat digital currency, you're going to have to be under this kind of robust regulatory regime or you're not going to be able to be used. So, I mean, I think that that's sort of the direction of travel that's happening right now, and it will take two or three years to play out. But it seems pretty clear."

Partially an analogy similar to what we saw with like, for instance, blockbuster or what many of these previous, like Kodak, like there's all these previous companies we've seen with the Internet that just, they were the dominant force in that industry. And because the upstarts had more motivation to find use in this new technology, they were able to take them out. And pretty quickly, frankly, unfortunately, I hate to say it because I know a lot of lawmakers and regulators listen to the show, but sometimes when I'm covering this space, I feel like the same thing is happening with the us government and the us dollar. Hopefully, I'm wrong about that, but obviously you are interfacing with these different jurisdictions. And one probably really notable country that has focused on blockchain technology and on central bank digital currency is China. They've rolled out its digital yuan fairly quickly. And I just wondered what your thoughts were as you're seeing the contrast between these two governments and how they approach stable coins and central bank digital currencies."

So that is still, they have not, they're not, to my knowledge, working on specific new rules for stablecoin issuers in China. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen. I think that if you look at the state of play, the priority in most jurisdictions from the government is get stablecoin regulations in place as quickly as possible. And so stablecoin rules for euro stablecoins are becoming model law. And that'll be years before there's a digital euro from the ECB. Stablecoin rules in Japan have been effective since this June. And that'll be, it's not even clear that there'll ever be a CBDC in Japan. And so the priority, including in the United States, I mean, the Fed has made it clear we are not working on a CBDC. And so the priority is there is private sector digital currency initiatives. There needs to be safeguards and rules, and there needs to be a fair market for competition with technology innovators, banks, non banks, etcetera. That's the priority because that is the here and now. I think as that happens, as every major jurisdiction in the world is supervising private sector innovation in the space, I think China will have no choice other than to also unleash their own creative technological competitive capabilities. Now it may be that an RMB stablecoin that's privately intermediated could actually be a more attractive instrument to businesses and others around the world than the actual CBDC because you kind of want to air gap between you and the chinese government. And so I think that's a real question. I think does a big corporation that's settling transactions cross border with China, do they want the government's systems reaching into their own technology environment? Probably not. And so private intermediation, it could be backed by a central bank digital currency. And thats where I think over the very long run in the United States. Well see, well see upgrades to the wholesale kind of core technology infrastructure of the central bank and then private intermediation will integrate to that. But itll principally be kind of stable coins and the kind of rapid, constant innovation cycle that comes with open infrastructure and technology innovation. That will be what is quote unquote retail, what's touching businesses and end users directly. And I think my own belief is that something like that will probably emerge for China as well in the future."

But it's a very clear thing that can be done, because then it's about you're fighting for the hearts and minds of users in the world, businesses, households, others that are making decisions as they turn on their computer or their smartphone. And I think the dollar remains the most resilient, most attractive reserve currency in the world. It remains the safest asset in the world.

So, for example, I think that would be, as I've already recommended in the US, I think that would be a positive step. I think one of the things that you're seeing as well is, and this is very new, there are provisions in Japan, for example, that are dealing with effectively various forms of reciprocity with foreign issued stablecoins. And I think thats really important as well, that we can get to like for like, treatment. So that if Im a business or IM in the capital markets in Japan, that the regulators in Japan will acknowledge something like USDC as an instrument in their markets, so long as there's regulatory equivalence in terms of the various safeguards that need to be in place. So I think that's something that we're seeing initial ideas around from other jurisdictions that's not explicitly addressed in the us stablecoin legislation right now. And it's a hard issue, but there'll be iteration around this. But ultimately, because these are digital assets that this move on the Internet and can show up in any digital wallet, it's just, where are the private keys? Who has them? I think the cross jurisdictional issues is an issue that has to be considered, and I'd like to see that considered more here in the US."

Right. Well, how does that happen? Well, right now, if you're a financial institution, the way that the AML rules work and the way that the KYC rules work is that if you're interacting, you, the financial institution, are interacting with another financial institution. You actually have to, you have to exchange the p, the personal information of your customers, whether it's a person or business, you have to exchange that information. So all these different financial institutions, whether they're a startup, fintech, or a giant bank or a broker dealer or any market participant, you have this vast amounts of proliferation of your personal information. Your PII is being broadcast over and over and over, and it's basically showing up in these honey pots everywhere. And so, yes, there are SoC standards and security standards and safeguarding standards, but at the end of the day, you as a person are having your personal information just blasted out everywhere. Well, crypto is, I mean, obviously, crypto is a loaded word, but it's cryptography. And there's innovations in cryptography that are constantly happening that allow for proofs without actually having to share the information. So zero knowledge proofs are, like, the most commonly referred to way to do that. But there's other types of cryptographic proofs where you can have a proof that shows up as, like, a certificate. It's a provable certificate that is like a credential. That credential then can be shown to someone, and that relying party can say, oh, you have a KYC credential. And that KYC credential was issued by a legitimate firm that has compliance with certain rigorous standards of knowing who their users are. And I'm able to rely on that, and I don't need you to give me all the person's information. And so there's a way to basically make, using cryptographic proofs, using digital credentials, these cryptographic credentials, to allow people to more safely interact without giving up their private information. And it allows for things like selective disclosure as well, which is the most common example being, if my daughter walks into a bar, why is it that she has to legally give the bartender her address and her name? Why? That doesn't make any sense. Why can't we just prove that we're of age? Why can't we present a credential from a digital wallet that proves that I'm of a certain age, and I've biometrically proven that I'm actually the holder of that. All this is crypto. Crypto. I'm really excited about basically various types of the use of cryptographic credentials, nfts, zero knowledge proofs, this whole collection of technologies that are totally becoming mainstream or have the potential to become mainstream. We can do a better job at proving identity without giving up our privacy. So we can have privacy preservation and proof of identity, and we can even have ways that financial institutions can exchange proofs without having to create these huge honey pots as well. So that will require that, say, the US Treasury Department, that sets the rules for kind of anti money laundering policy for financial institutions, or the global body, the Financial Action Task force, FATF, that sets the standards for what they require. It consorts. All the governments decide, you do need to say, yeah, we want to enable safer, privacy preserving, but still very rock solid identity checks. And so there's a way to do it and leverage crypto to solve those problems."

But I just thought I would give you one last opportunity. If there's any message specifically that you'd like to send to regulators and lawmakers, what would that be?"

        "text": "Look, I think there's a couple of things. I'll be a little bit of a broken record on the stablecoin issue, which is just that we have a moment. It's a here and now moment. There's a dollar competitiveness issue. There's a national competitiveness issue. There's a industry and market competitiveness issue. And while it's very easy to look at the people who've committed frauds, or the companies that have run Ponzi schemes, or the people who've been bad actors and say it's all crap, that is just not the case. We're right on the cusp of, I think, a very strong framework that would be very powerful for the US, the US dollar, for industry competitiveness, etcetera. So that I feel strongly about. The other thing I would say is that there really tends to be, and this isn't just in the United States, but it's everywhere in the world. Blockchain technology is colored through the lens as a financial technology. And I think it's really important that policymakers understand that we're talking about general purpose Internet infrastructure, general purpose Internet computing infrastructure, data infrastructure. It's a really, really important general purpose infrastructure that's important to a huge array of industries and categories. And so how we treat that infrastructure, it needs to be independent of just saying this is a financial regulatory matter, because it's actually not. It's really about a next layer of the Internet and getting that right. And so I find sometimes that the policies that are being considered are kind of, they're stovepiping everything or they're kind of marshaling everything into a financial regulatory lens. That is not a good position. I don't think it's accurate. And so I think it really just requires more and more understanding. And so I would encourage policymakers and their staff to really get a better understanding of, let's just call it the computer science of this network technology and what that is, because that's really where so much value will come. And it's not just because someone's got an airdropped token or whatever. The thing that people find problematic is."
