But most people's understanding was if you're running official ledger firmware, that seed where all your funds are stored, never leaves the device. Now, with Ledger recover, we've learned that in the firmware that you can install on Ledger, at least theoretically, it's only in the most recent firmware they've released."

But then he realized it was based on certain misperceptions around how Ledger worked. He was saying that he thought initially that it would just hold your keys and the keys would never leave. Now, when he realized, oh, your device can be upgraded, that would introduce the possibility for potentially, like, bad things to happen, like some new thing that takes your private key. But then he realized that actually this isn't how ledgers have worked all along, that they've always been upgradable because they're always adding new blockchains and things like that. And so he actually concluded that this was totally fine. Like you've always trusted Ledger, and you only have to trust them at that one point in time. You never have to do the upgrade. If for whatever reason, you're not comfortable upgrading the software, you could always just toss out your old device and get a new device with the new software.

        "text": "Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. SPF faces legal backlash over alleged fraudulent acquisitions this week saw the beleaguered crypto empire FTX suing its ex CEO Sam Bankman Friede co founder Gary Wang and former senior executive Nishad Singh over claims of fraudulent activity. The lawsuit alleges that these key figures were aware of the insolvency of Alameda research Banquet Freed's trading shop when they acquired the stock clearing platform embed for $250 million. FTX's current leadership claims that the funds used in this deal were illicitly drawn from FTX customers. Additional suits have been lodged against embeds founder and former CEO Michael Giles and the early investors who sold their stakes, such as propel Venture Partners. Notably, the case argues that FTX's bankruptcy representatives were swindled into a, quote, terrible deal due to the overvaluation of embed, which they say is now virtually worthless. Subsequent attempts to sell embed reportedly received bids far below the acquisition price. The highest bid was from Giles himself for a mere $1 million. In related news, Alameda Research and West Realmshire's two FTX units are suing to recover $6.9 million from embed financial shareholders, alleging misappropriation of funds. Before FTX's bankruptcy, jump trading profited nearly $1 billion from UST. Fresh SEC filings point towards jump trading as the unnamed firm that allegedly bolstered Terrausd or ustinous amid its 2021 deep from the us dollar. This connection emerged from the SEC's lawsuit against Terraform Labs and its co founder, Do Kwon, which accuses them of investor fraud and misrepresentation regarding UST jump trading. A major player in crypto trading has not been directly accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Terra Luna's $60 billion collapse a year ago. However, the SEC filing suggests that the firm profited nearly $1 billion from its arrangement with terraform labs. As part of the deal, JMP was provided the option to purchase Luna tokens at a 99% discount in exchange for making trades to improve UST's liquidity, a claim reinforced by a class action complaint filed by lead plaintiff Taewoo Kim. In a related development, Kwon was granted release from custody in Montenegro. Kwon, along with the company's former CFO Han Chang joon, posted a bail set at \u20ac400,000, or $436,000 as stated by the Podgorica Basic court. As part of their bail conditions, both will be under house arrest within the capital. During their hearing, they refuted accusations that their passports from Belgium and Croatia were fake. The duo also vowed to adhere to the terms of their bail, including responding to court summons. Tether moves to strengthen reserves with bitcoin investments tether, the issuer of the dominant stablecoin USDT, announced this week that it will allocate 15% of its net profits to buy bitcoin in a move aimed to diversify and strengthen its reserves. Based on the company's last attestation report, this investment could total about $222 million worth of bitcoin, adding to the $1.5 billion bitcoin stash already in its reserves. Tether CTO Paolo Arduino said the move is rooted in what he called bitcoin's proven resilience growth potential, and it's standing as a favored choice amongst institutional and retail investors. Despite past controversy surrounding the company's reserve management, USDT remains the largest stablecoin, with a circulating supply of more than $82 billion. SEC stands firm no rush on crypto regulation clarification in the ongoing legal tussle between Coinbase and the US securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the agency requested that the court reject the crypto exchanges plea to expedite rulemaking on cryptocurrencies. Secing no legal obligation on a timeline for its response, the SEC emphasized the complexities involved in defining cryptocurrency regulations. The request follows Coinbases April legal demand for a prompt response to its rulemaking petition on how securities laws apply to cryptocurrencies. Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul grewal, expressed concern over the SEC's stance, signaling that the regulatory ambiguity might persist. He warned of continued enforcement actions in place of clear rulemaking. Austin Campbell, a professor at Columbia Business School, echoed the concerns on Twitter. I am starting to worry about the future of the us financial system. If blockchain continues to dominate, mind share and use cases continue to proliferate, the US will be playing from far behind the pack and having destroyed a lot of trust with companies, many of whom may not come back even if things change. Ripple scores legal win as judge denies SEC motion to seal Hinman speech documents in another one of its legal standoffs, the SEC faced a setback this week when a court denied its motion to seal documents linked to a 2018 speech by former Division of corporation finance director Bill Hinman in which he stated that he did not view bitcoin and ether as securities. The SEC previously argued that the documents, which Ripple sought in discovery, were irrelevant to the case and could jeopardize the, quote, openness and candor within the SEC. However, Judge Annalisa Torres of the Southern District of New York held that these were, quote, judicial documents subject to a strong presumption of public access. Torres granted some redactions requested by both parties, primarily for personal and financial information. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the ruling as, quote, another win for transparency, anticipating the soon to be public Hinman emails. Meanwhile, the SEC may continue to challenge the admissibility of the documents as the trial progresses. SEC says Filecoin is a security this week, Grayscale received a notice challenging the asset manager over its Filecoin trust product. According to the SEC, filecoin, a token used in a blockchain based decentralized storage network, quote, meets the definition of a security. Grayscale, disagreeing with this stance, said it, quote, intends to respond promptly to the SEC staff with an explanation of the legal basis for Grayscale's position. While Grayscale contests the SEC's assertion, the fallout of this regulatory tussle remains uncertain and could result in registering the Filecoin trust under the Investment Company act of 1940 or even seeking its dissolution. Was Satoshi's stance on NFTs revealed a controversy erupted this week after the resurfacing of old bitcoin talk posts that suggested bitcoins mysterious founder Satoshi Nakamoto may have been pro NFTs Udy Wertheimer, associated with bitcoin ordinals project taproot wizards, ignited the speculation by alleging that the first bitcoin transaction ever was not for pizza, but for a JPEG image. Back in January of 2010, Wertheimer discovered a forum post in which a user named Sabineer announced plans to sell a JPEG for 500 BTC. Four months before the infamous 10,000 BTC pizza purchase, Satoshi himself appeared to provide advice on how to execute the transaction. However, critic Mike McDonald countered that the 500 BTC received by Sabineer were donations, not payment for the JPEG. Regardless, Satoshi's involvement in the transaction led some to believe that he would have supported the concept of nfts. As McDonald noted, the most notable thing of all is that Satoshi treated this all like it was the most normal thing in the world. He'd have absolutely been pro ordinals.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin's daily transaction volume hit an all time high, briefly surpassing that of bitcoin and litecoin. After the introduction of DRC Twenties Celsius navigates Lido withdrawals amid asset auction turmoil bankrupt crypto lender Celsius reportedly transferred its 428,000 staked ETH, or Steth, valued at around $780 million, to another wallet just before Lido, the leading Ethereum liquid staking protocol activated with Scholz. Amid some conjectures, Simon Dixon, CEO of investment firm bank to the future, commented, Celsius is likely lining up for staking directly without Lido in the middle. According to on chain data, Celsius accounts for 96.8% of steeth withdrawal requests on Lido. This has sparked concerns about prolonged unstaking times, though Lido reassured that a buffer of 440,000 ETH is expected to accommodate large withdrawals. As Celsius navigates its complicated scenario, a consortium known as Fahrenheit, including venture capital firm Arrington Capital and Minor US Bitcoin Corp. Has emerged as the lead bidder for the lenders $2 billion worth of assets in its bankruptcy auction. Michael Arrington, founder of the eponymous VC firm, explained the bid structure, saying, quote, we are proposing that the assets be placed into a new company and run with the sole goal of growing these assets to make stakeholders whole. Blockfi moves forward with liquidation proceedings in an escalation of its bankruptcy proceedings, BlockFi has emphasized its commercial claims against FTX and Alameda as pivotal, with potential recoveries to creditors exceeding $1 billion. The success of the litigation will heavily influence the return of funds to clients. Additionally, BlockFi is set on liquidating its lending platform, its lawyers stated, given recent regulatory developments, among other things, there may be a lack of meaningful value to be generated from a sale. On the flip side, the bankrupt lender stated that according to its estimates, nearly $300 million is due to be returned to BlockFi custodial wallet users. Additionally, the company confirmed that a hearing on the liquidation plan is scheduled for June 20, though the final course of action will depend upon approval from the bankruptcy court. Voyager Digital receives approval to start payouts bankrupt crypto lending firm Voyager Digital is commencing its liquidation process with customers poised to recover around 35%, or $1.33 billion, of their cryptocurrency deposits. The payout process is expected to commence as early as June 1, with a recovery rate hinging on the results of future litigation. The firm's liquidation plan comes after a failed buyout attempt by Binance us and two unsuccessful sale attempts, including one by now bankrupt FTX Voyager aims to repay customers with the same type of cryptocurrency that they had in their accounts or with the stablecoin USDC for unsupported tokens and the proprietary VGX token. Crypto legislation is passed in Europe. The Council of the European Union, representing 27 member states, unanimously approved the much awaited markets in crypto assets regulation, or MeCA. It requires wallet providers, exchanges and other types of crypto institutions to get license to operate across the block and sets reserve standards for stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, France has extended a welcome to crypto firms seeking refuge from us regulatory uncertainty. The country already has 74 registered crypto companies, a number that could increase dramatically with the new meca laws. We are proud to be pioneers, expressed Benoit de Jouvigny, a french authority. The EU's regulatory clarity is also driving a surge in venture capital funding for EU based crypto startups. As pointed out by Patrick Hanson, EU policy director at USD Coin, regulatory clarity is attracting capital and entrepreneurs globally. With VC investment in european crypto projects skyrocketing to nearly ten times within the year. Time for fun bits Ginny from Unchained has thoughts about how Sam Altman of OpenAI is returning to crypto and Worldcoin."

        "text": "Well, OpenAI founder Sam Altman is now turning his attention towards crypto, which I guess makes sense because AI can kind of manage itself now, like how you get back into gardening after your kids go to college. He's close to raising $100 million, which he clarified, as in Fiat, for Worldcoin's new minimalist wallet. Worldcoin isn't new. It got big last year with a crypto version of a universal basic income, like a crypto token, to be distributed equally to everyone in the world. I think this sounds totally easy. We just need to choose one of the coins whose value is zero, and there are a lot to choose from. There were a lot of issues with WorldCoin's initial rollout last year, but now it's back with a wallet that includes a global identification system. Basically, it scans your irises to prove that you're a human, and I cannot wait to make all of my exes try it. His first round of funding included investments from SBF, but I doubt he'll be part of this round. Unless in lieu of cash, they accept d and D hit points. I don't know what's gonna happen with Worldcoin, but I do think it's smart for Sam Altman to have his hands in both AI and crypto. True diversification the hottest sector in tech right now in crypto."
