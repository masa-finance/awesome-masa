        "text": "This has been quite the week in defi. It started with a pretty small hack of some so called factory pools on curve. What happened and how did the exploit work?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, so to kind of give some background here, curve and kind of uniswap are probably thought of as the most blue chip protocols. All of DeFi, in fact, Brax uses curve extensively. I'll get into that in a little bit. But one thing that set this exploit apart was that it was a compiler level bug. And so what that basically means is it was not something typical that you might see where someone who is writing the smart contracts forgot to check some condition, or they used some kind of poor rounding situation or something like that. The actual contract was coded properly, it had everything written properly. The curve core developers, who are some of the most veteran and OG in the space, they know what they're doing. There's a specific type of thing called a reentrancy bug, which a lot of just libraries have reentrancy guards. It basically allows, basically make sure that essentially the token accounting for when you withdraw and deposit tokens is done properly. And obviously for something like a amm pool, right? You want to make sure that swapping tokens, lp tokens, which means depositing two sides or one side of a token is done properly, that was all coded fine. So just to be clear about this, it was not someone forgot to do some kind of re entrancy check, it was the Viper compiler. And so VYPR is a smart contract language that's written in Python. So a lot of people probably know Python if they're a developer. Everyone's heard of it before that compiles down to Ethereum, EVM, bytecode. Most people write things in solidity, so the solidity language has a compiler that compiles to bytecode. All of Curve's software is written in Python. Other big projects that use it is yearn finance. But VYPR is not as popular by a long shot, obviously, as solidity. So the VYPR lang developers who write the compiler and make sure to upkeep it, well, realistically don't have a lot of resources compared to the solidity compiler. This bug, essentially for specific versions of Viper, just to simplify things down, made it so even though if you write a the correct code, you write add reentrancyguard, or lock the actual slot that checks the balance of tokens when it actually compiles. It does not compile into that, which is very very scary. You write the code as a developer and then you compile it. It does not actually do what it's written by compile."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "It's taking the human readable developer language into something that's machine readable and can be executed. Sort of."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "How to exactly. When you compile it, you compile it into opcodes that the Ethereum virtual machine executes. And then that's basically what is running the EVM on chain. People execute transactions that basically run a bunch of opcodes, that's not human readable, but they write code exactly as you said. It's human readable. The crazy thing is, I think this was July 30, I was traveling, so it was a little bit hectic. Basically. I think it was the curve devs and some other guys, they found the issue, right? And I think the pools that were affected were alchemyx pools and a few other ones. And they were trying to save them because anyone that could actually come and knew what was going on, they could just drain all the money from the pools because the accounting wasn't right the way that it was compiled. You can just basically, for example, send one token, take two out, something like that, right? And I think the issue at hand was they weren't fast enough to actually do it before the attacker or attackers managed to actually hit some of these pools. I believe some of the funds were returned by different addresses that were able to essentially white hat and remove the value there, right. And what's, what's important to note is only specific versions of VYPR that were used in some of these contracts. As you said, factory pools of a specific version of a factory deployer were vulnerable. So none of the fracs pools or other pools, or even the pools that have USD stablecoins were affected. The type of contract that was affected was one that had ETH in it, the actual l one token of the Ethereum blockchain, because the way that it actually checks for reentrancy is slightly different than ERC 20 tokens. And that was where the actual compiler level bug was. And so that was kind of what started the whole thing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So what would you say that said about the security of DeFi generally? You know, we had these multiple protocols that were hit. I think it was about more than 50 million that had been stolen. Interestingly, it wasn't even just that white Hap hats rescued some of the money, but MeV bot operators also stepped in to kind of take money from the hackers as this was going on. But what would you say this says about Defi?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, what's kind of crazy, right, is that it was obvious there was just value. There obviously was value that was not supposed to be leaked in that way. So there was a lot of both MEV happening, as well as just people racing to save or other people racing to steal value and stuff like that. But overall, I think the main thing here is that we've never seen, at least I haven't seen, and I've been in the ethereum web three space for a really long time. A major compiler level bug, which means that the code was written correctly, it was just not compiled correctly. That is different than 99% of issues that you might see where value gets stolen, whether it's anything, whether it's, for example, a bridge hack, wherever the actual solidity code didn't check something properly, like the person writing it forgot to check something. Or like the classical stuff like the Ronin bridge hack, where the keys from some employee or something that was running the bridge were compromised from some phishing attack or something like that, or they got access to their servers that validated transactions or whatever. This was much more different. I think this is just a different class of vulnerability and different situations. So obviously I think there's a lot of, you know, people shocked about it, but thankfully it didn't basically empty all of Curve's TVL and not all of the pools are or were vulnerable. And I think obviously the thing afterwards that I think you might possibly ask about."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Ensuing situation in terms of the value of the crv token, how this affects TVL, and just the overall defi landscape, because the hack was kind of the prelude to some stuff like that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "But let's talk about that in conjunction with the fact that Curve founder Michael Igorov had taken out really large loans on Aave, on fracs. I mean, this just generally created this issue that he might get liquidated once the price of curve started dropping. So talk a little bit about, you know, how all that played out for sure."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And so one thing I want to point out before all of this hacking stuff, which is where we started and stuff is the loans themselves were taken out a long time ago. So basically Michael Igarov, which I think is probably one of the smartest people in the entire space, very long term oriented. He's actually, I think, embodies a lot of the ethos of what people think in terms of what founders should be like. For example, I try to spend, for example, all the time in the community, on telegram channels, on Twitter, answering everything I can. I'm actually in the our telegram, which is the main place, everyone asks questions and I'm right there, both working on the protocol, design, code, everything, as well as just always conversing with the greater fracts community. Michael is exactly the same way. He's a developer, he writes the code, he designed stuff, he wrote the original curve white paper. He's also arguably one of the few people that I would say is as active as I am. And so I don't know when I kind of think about people who embody the founder mentality in crypto, you think of Stani from Aave, you think of Robert Leshner from compound, think of Michael Igorov from curve. And I like to embody that as much as I can. There's a lot of people that say, for example, oh, like it's so refreshing. Sam is always here and everyone can talk to him and stuff. And I always think, isn't that how it's always supposed to be? But it seems like it's not, right? It seems like there's kind of a lot of the CEO mentality, which is like you're kind of off in like your own kind of higher place, and then you have like community managers or something that are supposed to take care of everything for you. And I never really bought this. I never thought about anything like that. I always wanted to be part of the actual action on the ground floor, both building talking, being a part of everything. I think Michael is exactly one of those guys, technical, social and everything. The prelude to this, obviously, was he did not want to sell his crv tokens. He took large loans on Aave Fraxland as well, which is a lending platform on Frax finance. And then also, I think Mim, Abracadabra, and maybe a few other places that I might be forgetting. And what's extra painful here is a lot of the on chain crv token liquidity was on curve and it was against ETH. And like I said before, the primary thing that was vulnerable in this compiler hack was ETH token reentrancy, the token that if it's paired against Ethereum itself, part of the hack not only drained all of the liquidity on chain of the crv token, it actually gave a large amount of crv tokens to the exploiter address, whoever the hacker might be. And it also drained the liquidity. It's almost a double whammy. The liquidity is gone, and the curve tokens now are in an address that presumably wants to dump them and sell them for eth or something and try to get away, right? And so all in this chaos, in this situation, right, you have these loans that before the exploit might have been a little bit eyebrow raising. I know there was a lot of kind of a few aave threads on their governance form and things like that that talked about, oh, is this too big of a loan? Is it all right, should we change the parameters and stuff? But nothing brutal, right? Nothing like, holy crap, this is like a implosion waiting to happen, right? But then precipitated with this extraordinary situation, the liquidity is gone. It was drained, the curve tokens, not only is it liquidity gone, but now the curve tokens are in some unknown entity's hands, presumably very malicious entities. This became very critical. And different lending protocols work slightly differently. So one of the things with Fraxland that we designed that's very unique to, to frax Len's system is that instead of the protocol having some fixed interest rate based on how much utilization is used in a lending pool, it also is time dependent as well. So for example, if the utilization is above 85%, for example, if that's the equation, then every 12 hours or every half life is what it's called. The interest rate will double or it'll 1.5 x or it'll 2.5 x or whatever. And the idea behind that is the interest rates dynamic. And it'll fluctuate based on time so that it's reactive. Both the borrower will think, okay, this is too much interest. I'm going to repay some of the loans, or lenders will see, oh wow, I get a lot of interest for depositing and being a lender here. It's not like AAVE or compound or other places where some of them have fixed interest rates and others have linear interest rates on. So like for example, if 90% of the assets are utilized, that's like a 6% interest rate and it doesn't double 1224 48. And Frax land is different in that way. And so what happened was obviously as this situation basically kind of spun out of control, everyone there was a lender in the CRV, Fracs lend pair. They rushed to grab their fracs stablecoins. They didn't want to lend in this situation, right. They didn't want potentially there to be a liquidation of CRV. But that wasn't enough to buy back enough of the dollar for expec stablecoin. And so what does that do? That starts doubling the interest rate of the CRV borrowers predominantly, Michael, every 12 hours it started out as relatively at 10%. Then I think it got to 2030. And every hour it goes up because every 12 hours has double. So everyone was just kind of refreshing the page. You know, it was 60, 70, 80. I think it got over to like 120 or something percent at it at the peak or obviously some good things happened."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, so far, the resolution was that obviously Michael had to repay some of the debt on Fraxland, at least in other places, too. But predominantly the time sensitive one was Fraxland, which you might have noticed there was a large OTC deal over the counter for Michael selling some of his crv tokens to predominant people in the space, like Justin sun. Like Machi, I believe. C two, TP, the founder of Convex, also bought some and a few others, I believe today. It was also said that the CEO of Hobie Exchange also bought some. I'm not sure, but I'm trying to keep up with it. And then a lot of the debt was paid down so that the utilization rate on the Fraxland pair was not something so high that it would double. In fact, the opposite happens where it slowly halves instead, because it's a mirror image, the equation actually, now the interest rate is going down, which is very manageable, right? Obviously, the entire situation is a little bit concerning, right? Because I think AavE is also thinking about what they can do overall. I just want to also say, for example, these loans obviously were not something that was nefarious. It's just that this unexpected, absolutely crazy situation with the compiler bug in VYPR basically not only shook confidence and curve, and also the crv token, obviously it also took away the liquidity of the crv token on chain and gave an unknown entity a bunch of crv tokens. The entity that drained the pool. Right. So it was almost like a triple, quadruple whammy all on top of each other. And that's really unfortunate."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So what does it say that a large part of the solution here was these OTC deals? Like, what does it say about Defi? Or do you not agree with how I just phrased that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, yeah, so I'm sure a lot of people feel this way. And personally, obviously, as a founder and stuff, I understand both sides. I feel slightly differently. And the reason for that is, as a founder, I always have this viewpoint that, you know, it's. It's always the founder's role to take things. And like, all the, all the bad stuff that happens is kind of the responsibility of the founder. And all the good stuff that happens is everyone else and belongs to the community. And that sounds really unfair, but it's almost kind of like, and I'm not religious or anything, but it's almost kind of like a Christian, like a, like a Jesus way of thinking about it, where it's your responsibility to kind of suffer the consequences if you're a founder. But if you succeed, it belongs to the token holders, the community, and just everything that the world has accomplished, so to speak. But all the bad stuff is kind of your fault. And I actually think that that's just the territory with playing the role as the creator of something. And the first thing is, I think what would have happened otherwise. First of all, people would have said, if he sold CRV tokens, he's a scammer, right? Then he's just dumping on everyone. If he takes out a bunch of big loans, he's secretly just a scammer. He wants to sell a bunch of CRV tokens. If he locks them and participates in governance, he's a scammer taking control of the protocol. If you think about it, there's just no way out of just being labeled as the bad person in a situation when you're a founder. And I don't even say that in terms of, in a bitter way, I just say that in terms of, that's just the responsibility. That's what you're signing up for. Right. And so, for example, in this situation, the loans were fine overall, obviously, maybe some of the sizes were big, but they were overall fine. Before this whole situation, obviously no one thought, what if a compiler level bug happens? Then we're all in trouble, right. I think that the fact that there's still a lot of OTC demand and a lot of people that want to participate in the curve ecosystem is actually a good thing to actually highlight. And the fact that curve is one of the large backbones of Defi, I think overall the situation will be fine. Obviously there's people that say, well, this proves, like you're saying this proves that DeFi doesn't work, or this proves that there's just a bunch of stuff that has to happen behind the scenes of for it to work. And first of all, I think that if the lending systems other than Fraxlin, for example, incorporated more things like Fraxlin's innovations, like time dependent interest rates, and actually were more autonomous, this whole thing would overall just kind of fix itself, right? It would oscillate to the right kind of market system. A lot of it was just because, for example, Mim has fixed rate interest rates. They have to just actually go in and change interest rates. AAvE has to vote on them per recommendations of like, their. I think it's gauntlets, safety reports, and these kinds of things. I think Defi could just be a little bit more autonomous. It would be better. But I don't think there's anything wrong with a founder trying to take out some loans. Obviously, there's the meme that I think a lot of people were fixating on. I think Michael had bought some large properties in Australia. Right? And regardless of what you do, forget about this specific thing. Like I said, you're always playing the role as the founder of it's your fault if something happens, but if something good happens, it's not really. You can't use it as a defense when something bad happens. You're always supposed to take kind of the beating, so to speak, right. And at least that's how I view it. A lot of founders think that's unfair. A lot of people think, well, that's not right. They're treating you wrongly or they're, you know, doing this or that. I try to make sure my. My own view is just, it is what it is."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Right? But so going forward, like, what do you think the Defi community will do differently to prevent this type of situation in the future? And you know, really what I'm talking about is two things. It's the compiler level type bugs, and then I. What happened with Michael's loan situation?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, the compiler stuff is just very scary because it basically makes it so that people, for example, don't want to try any different kinds of things other than solidity. I personally don't code in viper. I think overall, the viper language will be stronger with more security audits and more attention paid to it after this situation. Obviously, that's a very tough question, and I'm not sure in terms of loans. I think lending markets haven't had a lot of innovation come to them. And so, for example, fracs. We're trying to do our part with fracs lend in terms of how everything works there. Everything is isolated. There's new types of interest rates. There's actually something called dynamic debt restructuring, which means there can't be bad debts. Everyone just. It's gets socialized if there's a liquidation that doesn't cover everyone's debt. So no one needs to run towards whatever's left and then kind of brick the pool for what's remaining for everyone. That doesn't act fast enough. And I think this kind of innovation and just new features are very important to make it so that this kind of stuff doesn't really happen again. And I know there's a lot of oracle less lending protocols, some of them you might have had on your show or other shows. And these are supposed to be the new generation of DeFi that's even more autonomous, that doesn't actually require meeting on Zoom or putting a governance vote on a forum to fix the curve founders loan situation and convening a risk counselor or something like that. We need more defi stuff that's similar to uniswap, both in terms of the lending side and the stablecoin side, where they're just autonomous in and they work."

Razzlekahn's husband says he hacked Bitfinex Ilya Dutch Liechtenstein admitted to being the original hacker behind the 2016 Bitfinex cyber attack, a theft that grew to a worth of $4.5 billion. The bombshell confession came during a plea hearing in Washington, DC on Thursday, where Liechtenstein pleaded guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin. His wife, Heather Morgan, also known as the social media rapper Rosalcon, is set to enter her own guilty plea. The couple had been arrested in February 2022, with the Department of Justice seizing more than 94,000 of the hacked bitcoins, marking the largest seizure in DOJ history. The couple's cooperation with authorities, including providing additional wallet addresses holding more stolen funds, could potentially influence their sentencing. DOJ looks to cancel SBF's bail the US Department of Justice this week sought to revoke the bail of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman, freed amid allegations of witness tampering and leaking confidential information. The DOJ claims that SBF attempted to undermine the upcoming testimony of former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellisone by leaking her private diary entries to a New York Times reporter. SBF's legal team has countered these allegations, arguing that their clients contact with the reporter was a legitimate exercise of his First Amendment rights. They maintained that the information shared was already known to the reporter and was not produced in discovery. John Reed Stark, former chief of the US securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Internet Enforcement, comments on the situation, saying that Judge Louis Kaplan faces a tough decision. He could view SBF's actions as an effort to improperly influence witnesses and choose to either modify his bail conditions or revoke his bail entirely. FTX unveils restructuring plan the bankruptcy estate of crypto exchange FTX has unveiled a draft reorganization plan that includes a potential restart of the crypto exchange for non us customers. The plan proposes to categorize claimants into specific groups, with offshore exchange users classified as.com customers and us users as us customers. Non us users could potentially receive non cash consideration in the form of equity or tokens in a new offshore exchange. However, the plan has been met with criticism from the official committee of unsecured creditors they expressed disappointment at not being consulted on the plan, saying that the proposal was more a collection of ideas than a concrete plan. They have called for control of any post reorganization company to be placed in the hands of qualified parties selected by the creditors. The committee also criticized the high professional fees incurred during the bankruptcy process, which have already exceeded $330 million, making it one of the most expensive corporate bankruptcies in history. Judge disagrees with Ripple ruling in a significant development this week, a us district judge denied a motion to dismiss the case against terraform Labs brought by the SEC, which alleges that TfL's crypto assets qualify as securities. Judge Jed Rakoff rejected terraforms argument that a recent decision in the SEC's case against Ripple Labs invalidated the agency's case against them. In his order. Judge Rakoff disagreed with the ripple decision, stating that he declines to draw a distinction between tokens sold directly to an institutional investor and those sold through secondary market transactions to a retail investor. This stance contradicts the ripple ruling, where Judge Annalisa Torres deemed that XRP sold to retail investors on exchanges did not qualify as securities transactions. Justin Browder, a partner at Wilkie Farr and Gallagher, commented on Twitter that Judge Rakoff's opinion in the terror case is, quote, far from a complete departure from the ripple holding, end quote adding, quote he agrees with the fundamental premise in Judge Torres decision that tokens themselves are not investment contracts, end quote. In related news, terraform Labs was granted permission by a us federal judge to subpoena FTX for information pertinent to its defense against the SEC enforcement action, finance may be charged with fraud. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, may face US Department of Justice fraud charges, according to reporting by Semaphore. However, officials are reportedly cautious due to the potential for widespread industry disruption, similar to the aftermath of the FTX collapse. To avoid such a scenario for commonplace investors, other options are under consideration. According to the semaphore report, these allegations have caused a drop in the value of bitcoin and Binance's BNB token. The development adds to Binance's existing legal woes, as it was previously sued by the CFTC and the SEC for allegedly evading us laws. CZ nearly shut down Binance us in other Binance news reports emerged this week that Binance CEO CZ considered shutting down the company's us subsidiary to protect its global operations. The decision was reportedly put to a vote by the board of directors, but Binance US CEO Brian Schroeder opposed the move, fearing the impact on customers. Meanwhile, Binance has denied allegations of conducting billions of dollars worth of transactions in mainland China where cryptocurrencies are banned, the company stated following a Wall Street Journal report that, quote, the binance.com website is blocked in China and is not accessible to China based users, end quote. Three AC co founder challenges us court in a surprising turn of events, Kyle Davies, co founder of the collapsed crypto hedge fund three arrows capital, renounced his us citizenship and declared himself a full citizen of Singapore. The move by Davies is seen as an attempt to distance himself from the jurisdiction of us courts amid ongoing legal proceedings. A subpoena was recently issued by three ACS liquidators who are seeking information about the funds collapse. As a non us citizen, Davies and his legal team now argue that he is not subject to the authority of us courts. This development adds another layer of complexity to the legal proceedings around three ACS bankruptcy, with the fund owing creditors an estimated $3.5 billion. The next hearing and three AC bankruptcy case is scheduled for August 8. Bald token sparks controversy and speculation the bald token, a new meme coin launched on Coinbase's layer two network base, saw a dramatic fall of 90% in value after a meteoric rise in the preceding days. The plunge followed allegations of a rug pull by the token's developer, who reportedly removed a significant portion of its liquidity from the decentralized exchange Leet swap. The developer, who remains pseudonymous, denied selling any tokens, stating that they only added and removed two sided liquidity. However, this explanation did not quell the concerns of investors, with some arguing that adding two sided liquidity when the price increases is effectively the same thing as selling tokens. The bald developer replied to this claim on Twitter with only one word correct bald. Sudden rise and fall has sparked a wave of speculation, with some pointing fingers at wallet activity linked to Sam Bankman Fried's Alameda research and a halt in said activity during Bankman Fried's recent incarceration. On Thursday, crypto sleuth Zack XBT said he potentially found the person behind bald. In a series of tweets, he showed evidence that the bald deployer address was linked to crypto Twitter influencer Milky Way, who earlier this year had written, quote, part of me wants to do an experiment which wouldn't be a rug, but I won't because in the eyes of some it would make similar things which are definitely rugs seem more legit. End quote. Despite the controversy, the base network itself saw a surge in total value locked or TVL reaching over $60 million ahead of its upcoming public launch.

George Santos is now involved in a crypto scandal. A campaign donor told the New York Times that Santos and two others tried a nigerian prince type scam on him. They approached him saying that there was a wealthy polish citizen who wanted to buy crypto but couldn't because his assets were frozen, and then asked this donor to start an LLC to gain access to the funds. In Santos defense, the intersection of the Venn diagram of people whose assets are frozen and people who want to buy crypto is pretty big. The donor didn't go through with it, but I do believe his story because it's honestly really, really, really vulnerable to admit that you donated to George Santos. You wouldn't just make something like that up. I don't understand why George Santos can't just get into insider trading like a normal politician. At least then he'd still be welcome in the Hamptons. But honestly, I've always believed that if George Santos wants people to believe he's innocent, he should just say he's guilty."
