We are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. So it has been another very eventful week. Tarun and I were just in Dubai for token 2049, which was basically like an end of the world situation going on over there. I don't know if anybody followed what was happening on Twitter, but there were insane storms that beset Dubai or just generally around that area in UAE and some of the neighboring countries. Most people flew in early part of that week, and then Tuesday, which is actually the same day that I flew in, a crazy storm flooded Dubai. It was, I think, two years worth of rain. In about 24 hours, all the streets got flooded a bunch of people who were actually on my flight. So I had a driver that was waiting for me when I arrived because I was worried about what was going to happen with the floods. I was supposed to go to Abu Dhabi after I landed was a couple hours. I was like, you know what? Nevermind, I'm just going to go to my hotel. Like, this kind of seems really dicey. People who were on my same flight who were just behind me, they had to wait multiple hours to get a taxi and to get like, it took me 15 minutes to get to my hotel. It took the people who were on my same flight, I was texting with them during the day. It took them 6 hours to get from the airport to the hotel, same hotel that I was staying at. And they were like, you know, they're fjording through like, flooded tunnels and like, you know, cars were floating through. Insane. It was, it was total fucking apocalypse stuff. It was crazy. Tarun, you had an ordeal when you were getting in, right?"

And then instead, because I was like, this city, I bet you if it rains too much, like Uber drivers all crash everywhere. It's like Texas and the snowstorm. And so it turned out there were other people who made the same decision as me. And unfortunately, we landed later than you, so we didn't get our cars. So the car company, car service company, rented a bus. And this bus took about like five or 6 hours to drive. It would normally take like 20 or 30 minutes. But the best part about it was I spent my bus journey sitting next to one Anthony Scaramucci. And it was a very funny ride because we get almost all the way from the airport to where all these hotels are. And everyone's excited. Finally it's done. Mister Scaramucci does not feel that way. He gets off at the first stop and he says, I'm going to get a cab back to the airport after we've fjorded through tunnels, as you put it, so that I can leave right now. And it was like, wow. But all I got to say is, he was very nice. I was like, you know, I was like, first of all, I was just not expecting."

So pretty much everything that was scheduled. So the main conference was to start on Thursday, but, like, Tuesday and Wednesday, everyone had all these other events and lunches and kind of pre conference side events. Everything got canceled. So many venues got flooded. A bunch of people who I knew who lived in Dubai, like, their houses got flooded. You know, water was seeping in through the windows. It was just total mayhem for everybody in the city. Even the hotel that I was staying in, which is a nice hotel, like, the ground floor of the hotel. I was on the third floor, ground floor got flooded. So those people had to, like, move rooms or just, like, live in a flooded hotel, I guess. Like, the ceiling was dripping. So if you were on the top floor, you were also getting issues with the rain. It was just. It was so insane. Like, I did not think that that was even possible in a city of this stature like Dubai. And then the next day, it took a little while for the streets to clear up, but basically, the city was bifurcated where certain parts of the city were still basically underwater, and certain parts of the city were traversable. So the part of the city that I was in, you could get around within that area, but anybody who was downtown, you were just like, I can't see you today. Maybe I'll go up there on Thursday or Friday when the streets clear up. And so, like, if you drove going through downtown or, like, going to downtown, there were just abandoned cars, like Rolls Royces and, like, you know. You know, lamborghinis that were just like, they just been abandoned because they were just floating. You know, they were just like, fuck."

I don't know if it's true, but I heard that there was, like, some tourist who basically was, like, on Instagram talking about, oh, it's because of cloud seeding. And they were thrown in jail. Normally they would deport you, but they can't. There are no flights, right? They can't deport you. So they just threw her in jail until, like, the plane started going again.

I don't want to be in the neighborhood because maybe the airspace is going to get closed. And everybody I spoke to, I was like, hey, I'm thinking I might cancel my flights and not go. And they were like, what? You're the only one who's not going to go. Everyone else is going. And I was like, oh, maybe I'm an idiot. Am I just paranoid? And it's classic VC move is that I asked everyone else what they're doing. And nobody else was canceling. And I was like, oh, I guess I should just go. And absolutely the wrong move. I should have just. I should have just fucking followed my gut and cancelled. Uh, and then that weekend, uh, Israel retaliated against Iran, which is exactly what I was worried about. Um, and I was lucky. My flight, uh, was a day after, uh, so. But if it was, my flight would have been canceled because the airspace got closed. So, um, but anyway, the conference itself was actually pretty good. Like, I was surprised how many people showed up and, like, still kind of, you know, I mean, everyone was there.

The interesting thing. So this was all happening right around the time of the bitcoin happening. So that is kind of the big story of this week. The bitcoin happening, for those who do not know, is every four years, bitcoin supply cuts in half. So when we talk about bitcoin being deflationary, not just supply. Supply issuance. Bitcoin supply issuance. Uh, the rate of issuance or the inflation rate of deflation."

So, ever since Satoshi Nakamoto originally programmed bitcoin, there was basically a rule that roughly every four years, the issuance rate of bitcoin cuts in half, meaning the block reward that you get cuts in half every four years until the year like, 2100, something, at which point there is no more new bitcoin being minted. And so that's what we mean when we say that bitcoin is deflationary. Technically, it's disinflationary, meaning the inflation rate is going down every single year. That happening happens every four years on the dot. And this was the fourth happening. So it's been 16 years, basically, since bitcoin started, and therefore the inflation rate and the mining reward cut in half one more time. So this is widely anticipated because bitcoiners love to talk a lot about the havening as being a very bullish event for bitcoin. The theory of why the havening is bullish always been a little bit of a mystery to me. And I'm going to show my cards here that I'm a having nihilist. I don't think the having matters, but I. Bitcoiners will say that the havening is a very bullish event. They will draw all these charts and they'll show roughly a few months after. The havening is usually an all time high and something. I don't know. I don't totally follow the arguments, but the havening happened. I think it was Friday or Saturday, depending on what time zone you're in, that the havening took place."

Right? So the security budget of bitcoin gets cut in half. In that if the price of bitcoin stays the same for an extended period of time, then there's really like less incentive to secure the network. But on the other side, there's half as many coins being minted per day which are being sold. And from a technical perspective, there's fundamentally less of a gravity on the price of bitcoin. Because miners are in the business of selling. They are good at electrical engineering and they make bitcoin. In order for them to actually achieve a profit, they have to sell the bitcoin or hedge it in some way that sells the bitcoin. Less block reward, less selling. And so selling has gone down due to miners mining bitcoin. It's a drop in the ocean compared to the total market for bitcoin. And like how many people want to buy or sell on a given day? But like directionally there is less gravity to the price. And so I think it's generally like a good thing."

I think it was almost 40 BTC in transaction fees, which is much higher than the subsidy, which is what got cut in half. I think it wasn't priced in because no one knew how much demand there would be for runes right around the happening. Now that's a very tongue in cheek answer because that's kind of nothing to do with the happening. But the idea that the bitcoin transaction fees were higher than the block reward multiple for like a non trivial percentage of blocks post happening is more a sign that the security budget thing in the sense that the happening is a religious event for bitcoin maximalists. And people have found ways to add new things around each religious event to increase the net fees around that time. Then maybe that will be a counterbalancing force. But it's sort of more random than the happening itself, so hence it becomes harder to price it."

Um, really, I think the reason why, you know, you could argue that it's bullish is because it just creates a news event for bitcoin. Um, every single bitcoiner is on network television, on mainstream press, talking about the happening, getting it back in the news cycle. And short of that, there isn't, there aren't really that many opportunities to talk about bitcoin unless, you know, the ETF is launching or uh, you know, something else is, is happening. But usually you're talking about the price.

And so like my personal view is probably around like two weeks. Most of the flow for people who actually like, are involved in bitcoin have like figured out that the happening is happening, right? When it happens, yeah, there's absolutely incremental people learning about it for the first time in four years or the first time in general.

And maybe they're like, yeah, maybe I'll put 1% into bitcoin. And this is kind of what we see. I don't know if you saw some of the holders from the bitcoin ETF and were revealed this week. And it's kind of random, it's a lot of random wealth managers from all around the world who are putting small allocations of their assets into bitcoin. And I'm sure maybe it's not those people, maybe to some of those people, maybe it's retail investors, but it's a brand awareness campaign. And I think that alone is maybe good."

They just have some ads that are kind of like whatever or they could do, like, the polar bear and everyone feels warm and fuzzy and they're like, oh, I want to go out and drink some coke. So, like, they can underperform or overperform relative to the fact that, yes, they're going to do brand awareness, but sometimes it sucks and sometimes it's awesome. And I guess it feels like the same thing must be true of the having is that sometimes the having marketing, brand awareness, people on tv talking about it, it hits and it's like, wow, actually more people are going to buy bitcoin than we thought. We're going to buy bitcoin because they're having. But it can underperform. And it seems like maybe, but then."

        "text": "Okay, so, all right, I think we've betrayed a little bit our cards here on Priceton or not priced in. One of the things that Tarun was alluding to was this new phenomenon called runes. So runes created by Casey Rod Armour, who is the originator of ordinals and inscriptions on bitcoin. So he created this new standard, basically trying to create a better version of what was previously known as BRC 20, which is basically a way to try to create an equivalent of an ERC 20 token on bitcoin. BRC twenties, however, were super inefficient. They were very expensive. They were kind of a really stupid way to implement a fungible token on top of bitcoin. Casey created this much more efficient, a standard that's much more aligned with the Utxo model that's used on bitcoin already. And so there were a bunch of rules that were implemented around rune. It was going to kick off. You could basically mint the first runes by taking a ticker. The ticker. There's certain rules around the tickers have to be a certain number of letters long, and there are only certain characters you can use. And so people could mint those tickers. For a new rune. I think it's called a rune, starting with the having. The first block of the having. And that's why there was this crazy, effectively an auction that took place in the first bitcoin block post having of people trying to find the best tickers and mint these new runes and all this stuff. So that drove a crazy amount of fees on bitcoin for about 24 hours. Since then, the activity has really died down. I was looking through the runes explorer and it looks like a ton of them didn't really get minted out. Uh, it seems like most of them actually are not fully minted. Um, and uh, I don't know, this kind of seems like a bit underwhelming. So there was $80 million in fees on bitcoin on day one. And those fees have basically gone down to pretty close to baseline now, uh, a few days later. So thoughts on runes? I've seen a lot of chatter about it online, but it seems like people have mostly stopped talking about it today."

        "text": "Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah. Actually, funfair did, too. So it's like the casinos and the unsavory stuff were very experimental. You know what they say about it's the toughest industries that have to experiment with new technology. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, well, speaking of tough industries, there's a big story this week about Uniswap that got hit with a wells notice from the SEC. So let me explain what all those things mean Uniswap. Most of you are probably familiar, it's the biggest Dex. It's an amm, completely decentralized. It runs with no on chain kind of administration whatsoever. It's been around forever. Run by Hayden Adams, so not run by, I should say, founded by Hayden Adams. So the SEC, which we know both the CFTC and the SEC have been interacting with Uniswap labs for quite a while, since, of course, Uniswap has been around since, I think, 2018 or 19. The SEC, it was announced on April 10, issued a wells notice to Uniswap. So a wells notice is when the SEC is considering bringing a lawsuit or some kind of enforcement action against a counterparty, they are required by law to first give a wells notice, which basically says, hey, we are planning to sue you. If you have any kind of contradicting evidence that would lead us to think that maybe we should not be suing you or that this would be an error, here is your chance to present us that information. Almost always after Wells notice, the response to the wells notice doesn't end up causing the SEC not to go forward with the lawsuit, but at least gives the company time to prepare themselves and potentially get their affairs in order, effectively for what's to come. Now, you might remember when the SEC sued Coinbase, as well as when the SEC sued ripple. In both cases, when the SEC sent them their wells notice, both Coinbase and ripple front ran, the SEC went to the public and basically started a pr campaign immediately saying, we got issued with the wells notice. We believe the SEC is doing things unfairly and they're trotting over the rights of Americans to interact with crypto, blah, blah, blah. We're going to fight them to the death. And they kind of control the narrative, which I'm sure very much frustrated the SEC at the time, this was considered to be a crazy thing to do. This is not what happens generally. Normally in most other industries when your regulator is suing you, you slink away, start preparing lawyers and preparing to say lots and lots of no comment. Instead, Coinbase and Ripple showed that actually you want to go on the offensive. And so far it seems to have been largely effective, although it's not over, but it's hard to tell. But it looks like so far, people think that, hey, it actually looks like this was the right strategy. Well, Uniswap has done the exact same thing. Once they got the wells noticed from the SEC, Uniswap went to Twitter and basically said, hey, the SEC is supposed to be protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly markets. I think Uniswap does a better job of this. The SEC should not be coming after us. We are founded by american entrepreneurs. We've been following all the laws, blah, blah, blah, effectively stating that, hey, we're going to fight this. We think the SEC is in the wrong. We have no control over Uniswap. The protocol, and basically come at me, bro, was effectively the energy that Uniswap was giving the Uniswap token. Unitoken did. Took a hit on the day that the wells notice was announced. I think it went down roughly 15%. But the industry really rallied around Uniswap under the belief that Uniswap is going to be a very, very strong defendant. Uh, now, that said, we don't know what the charges are. Uh, people are speculating that these charges may be, um, you know, being an unregistered broker, uh, or something, which, you know, many people are saying that this would probably not stick because judges have been very unsympathetic to this claim. Coinbase, of course, in their case, had this claim thrown out, uh, for Coinbase wallet, saying that, you know, they had no custodial control. Uh, however, uh, it's also possible they go after Unitoken, claiming that unitoken is a security, in which case, I. This might be the first battleground case to decide whether a governance token for something like this ends up being an unregistered security. So I'll stop there. That was a lot. What's your guys take on the Uniswap Wells notice?"

        "text": "Well, none of us have actually seen, at least as I understand it, the Wells notice. All we've seen is Uniswap's response. It came from Hayden. It came from. There was a great blog post. I've read the blog post. I thought it was wonderfully written, where they framed, really, you know, the arguments for why a uniswap is important, b, you know, it really shouldn't be a target of, you know, enforcement when there's extremely vague and nebulous applicability of, you know, historical laws to them and see why they think that whatever the charges may be, they're going to win. And I thought it was a wonderfully written blog post. You know, since then, there's been a lot of more sophisticated commentary coming on crypto Twitter and starting to be in the press. You know, I feel like in one of the next episodes, you know, once things start to come out to the public, maybe we should have on, you know, a guest who's like, more familiar with these issues. But I thought the response, and that's really the only thing that any of us on this show or on Twitter or anywhere have available. Their response was great. And, you know, I give a lot of kudos to the whole team at Uniswap foundation and Uniswap labs and everyone peripheral to it and, like, the community, because, you know, I feel like they are ready and willing to champion and fight to the death on a case that they have an extremely good shot at winning, according to pundits online. And so, you know, if this is the thing that creates case law where there's absolutely not enough or no case law, you know, uniswap is in phenomenal shape. You know, if they'd gone after, you know, some scammers, you know, I feel like the SEC would be better positioned, but they're not going after scammers. They're going after a company that has been trying to innovate the right way for a long time. And I think they make a terrible target."

Much less than Defi and Defi. I mean, I dont know. I think hes a national treasurer. And the SEC, it really feels like a huge, huge miscalculation in choosing uniswap as a defendant here. Right. But much better going after sushiswap or one of these other things that just plays worse as a defendant. You know, like they were kind of faster and looser. I'm sure they didn't. They were, they're not as well defended of a door. They don't have as much resources. They're not as beloved by the community. They didn't actually invent the fucking thing. Like, so many people are like, wow, amms blew my mind. They changed my idea of what was possible in finance. Literally, the example that people give of why DeFi is so transformational is uniswap. And the idea that you would go after this guy and this team to say, hey, let's make an example out of how bad this industry is and how noncompliant they are with the laws that they're supposed to mind read is just insane.

    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, this makes sense. But I think it's actually the other way around because, okay, when they go after Coinbase, right, they list these 13 proclaimed securities. Coinbase wins the case. If they can prove that none of those 13 assets are securities, right? Because those are the ones that the SEC actually claimed. If they put Uni on that list and Coinbase wins that case, then now it has bearing on the enforcement action against Uniswap. And the SEC wants to win as many cases as possible, which means. That means, it implies that the assets they listed on the Coinbase case, they were not planning to pursue. So you put things on there that you're not actually planning to go after, one by one. If you were planning to go after Solana, and you put Solana on the Coinbase case, then if they win either case, it fucks over the other case. Right? But if you. If you go after independent enforcement actions from the ones that you list as securities, then one judge over here in this district could be like, oh, yeah, I think this is fine. Another judge says, well, this has no bearing on this other case. So, like, I actually think that Uni is a security and screw these guys. Whereas if the same question was litigated in two different venues, very likely the judge would defer to whatever the other judge did. Given that the same question was being adjudicated, that actually makes a lot of sense as to why they didn't list uni, because they want to pursue it independently and they're not planning to go after any of the l one s because that's way too hard. Go after an l one. And it's like, well, but ethereum's not a security. And if either is not a security, on what basis is sold on a security. Right. So it's very safe to go after the l one s because. I'm sorry, very safe to name the l one s because you don't want to go after the one on one because if you actually. They take you to court, they're going to bring out ethereum as an example and it's going to make the SEC look really bad and kind of picking, playing favorites, whereas uni is very unique. Right. There is nothing really like uni. And so uni kind of has to go make a very different kind of shaped argument than the l one s could. That's my theory, crafting of maybe why the SEC chose to pursue it this way."

Obviously, you'd want to work with somebody who knows the insides of how the SEC works. And a few people from crypto Twitter were calling for, guys, let's freeze the SEC. No more hiring anybody who's worked at the SEC. So people learn this is not a way to get into the crypto industry. If you work for this institution, screw you, we're not going to hire you. I don't know if people are going to stand strong on that, because when you actually want to be dealing with the SEC, obviously it helps to have people who've been on the other side. And I imagine for ripple or Coinbase, they are very, very grateful to have legal support from people who understand the SEC from the inside.
