So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Shoppingblock that XYZ for more disclosures. So it's a good week for the good guys. There's a lot of anticipation right now in the markets about an ether ETF, and that is sending markets skyward. But there's a lot to talk about this week because it seems like the regulatory and legal picture for crypto has gotten more complicated. And there's a couple of crazy stories that I want to make sure that we cover. So we're going to jump right into it. So, first up, before we get to ether ETF, we have to talk about SAB 121. Okay? So I'm gonna do a little bit of scaffolding just so people understand what we're even talking about. So what is SAB 121? An SAB is a staff accounting bulletin. This is a bulletin, a piece of guidance that the SEC gives on various different things that they think people should do. It's not a rule. It's just kind of informal guidance. Okay. So, in March of 2023, after FTX collapsed, the SEC gave this guidance, SAB 121, that basically said, if you are an entity that is safeguarding crypto assets, like a bank, like a custodian, you can have this on your balance sheet as a liability, but you cannot have it as an asset. Okay? So this means if you're custodying a commodity, if you're custodying a painting, if you're custodying money on behalf of somebody else, it is both an asset on your balance sheet and a liability. But for some reason, crypto, according to the SEC, is special. Crypto is the only thing that if you're a bank, it is only a liability on your balance sheet. It is never an asset. If it's not an asset, then that means if you want to custody crypto on somebody else's behalf and you're a bank, then you have to have offsetting additional cash or additional equity against that because of all the prudential requirements for banks. So this effectively was a backdoor way of preventing banks to act as custodians or to custody digital assets, which means, implicitly, that this is widely perceived as being the SEC, you see taking a shot at crypto and trying to cordon it off from the regulated banking system, which also means that if you want to custody your assets with anybody in crypto, it has to be a coinbase or somebody who's not a regulated financial player, which kind of benefits the coinbases and anchorages of the world. Okay, so this was SAP 121. Many people in the industry complained about this, as well as people in the banking sector who were like, hey, I want to get into crypto, and I can't. Okay, then in February, so just a couple of months ago, SaB 121 was brought into the House of Representatives, one branch of Congress, which basically said, hey, this rule kind of sucks. This seems not good for the financial markets. We've already approved the bitcoin ETF. But still, we have this weird rule that banks are not allowed to hold bitcoin as an asset on the balance sheet. Let's overturn this. Okay. This was somewhat contentious within Congress. It ultimately passed in the House, and people assumed that this was going to fail in the Senate because ultimately repealing guidance given by the SEC is a pretty extraordinary move. It happens sometimes, but it's a pretty strong censure of what's being done by a regulatory agency that's supposed to be under Congress's supervision. So Biden then said on May 8, under an executive order that, hey, or, sorry, what is it? Guidance from the executive branch or something, that if this resolution, which is basically repealing this security bulletin gets. Or, sorry, the security accounting bulletin, if this gets passed, he is going to veto it, basically saying, Democrats, get in line. President doesn't like this. Do not approve this thing. Okay."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "And that occurred to the Senate? That occurred prior to the House vote?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Actually, yes, this occurred. Oh, I'm sorry, this occurred prior to the House vote. So it passes the House, which is republican controlled. So people are like, okay, well, pass the House. Probably nothing burger. You know, it's going to die in the Senate, goes to Senate, and it passes the Senate 60 to 38, meaning that the Senate is Democrat controlled. So this is a bipartisan repeal and censure of the SEC in front of both houses now of Congress. So this feels like. So, I mean, this kind of sounds like maybe inside politics, people are like, okay, why does this matter? This all sounds very obscure. And of course, the president has said he's going to veto this. So this is still going to be non trivial to actually get this thing passed, but it feels like this is presiding something very important that has changed in the air about crypto, which is one, crypto seems to now be bipartisan. This idea that the SEC has overstepped its bounds and the executive branch is playing too hard against crypto. Second, crypto is now getting political. We talked about this a little bit on the last show, but it seems like the air is starting to change, that this is an issue, that it's not going to be a defining issue of the presidency, but it's an issue that is in play. The way I put it last week, it's a pawn on the chessboard. It's not a rook, it's not a queen. In the last election, it didn't matter. Now it seems like it really does. And Sab seems to be the first inkling that this thing is going to play in politics now. So I don't know. It might be difficult for people to grasp why this is a big deal, but this feels like to most people a big deal. Robert, do you have a perspective on kind of framing how this matters?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I have a few perspectives. The first to touch on is just that SAP 121, as you briefly touched on, is absolutely terrible toxic guidance by a regulator. You know, the SEC is not a banking regulator. They're not FASB, which sets like accounting guidelines. You know, they are a securities regulator. And through that position of securities regulator, they way overstep their mandate like they've been doing with crypto, you know, in the aggregate, way out of side of their mandate to use the tools they have to make an attack against crypto. And this repeal of 121 was supported by banks and crypto and Republicans and Democrats, because fundamentally, it's just bad policy, it's malicious, zero upside policy. And so I think that's one of the reasons why we saw such broad support for repealing SAB 121. And what was most exciting about that is that this happens in spite of President Biden's threat and veto. The administration in the executive branch has really been latching onto their power when it comes to taking a stand against crypto. And in some ways, this is now a fight between Congress and the executive branch. Overdose crypto policy in the US. And the reason fundamentally, why the executive branch has any role here at all is because there's been an absolute void of legislation since 2009 when it comes to crypto. The SAB 121 repeal is the first standalone crypto legislation that's ever been voted on. There has been clauses that have been inserted into other bills that clearly people are voting on it on, like, you know, a major legislation focus not on a crypto specific focus. This was stand loan crypto legislation. Its the first time weve ever seen most House members or senators voting specifically on a crypto and a crypto only bill. And its the first bellwether weve had for where is crypto going in the US? And as you touched upon, the results are shockingly positive in that theres broad, beyond expectations, bipartisan support for good crypto policy legislation. And the response to that is what's even more inspiring. It's the response to that very quickly snowballed into fit 21 and the central bank digital currency repeal legislation, and a number of pieces of legislation snowballing in the House. Once the House observed this incredible bipartisan support for sound crypto specific policy. And so it's been a monster of a week. Sometimes it feels like a year or multiple years happens in just a short amount of time. In a lot of ways that feels like what's happening. And it dovetails and coincides with this rising crypto political grassroots movement. And I think everyone is just waking up to the fact that now is the time to be smart about this."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I think the line that I drew, so I remember when SAP 121, I was literally watching the speeches because it was kind of like you said, we talk a lot about Crypto's legal status in the US, and people forget that there's literally never been a single bill passed about crypto, ever. Bitcoin has existed now for more than ten years, and there's not been a single law passed singularly about crypto ever. So the first time that we see people not grandstanding, not like, you know, pandering to, you know, the cameras or whatever, but actually voting, we see actually that, like, hey, people are trying to be pretty reasonable within Congress, like, when they know their electorate is watching what they're doing, they're not single handedly saying, look, all this stuff is bad, and crypto needs to go out the window, even on the Democrat side, when the president has very clearly signaled his allegiances. So I suspect very strongly that SAB 121 is what caused the reversal in the fortunes for the ether ETF. And it's not that it in and of itself caused it, but that it caused everyone to look around and to notice, oh, shit, a lot of people care about this. And it's almost a kind of preference falsification where people look around and they realize like, oh, everybody else seems to also be uncomfortable with the status quo and also seems to think like, hey, we shouldn't just like lemmings fall off this cliff of being anti crypto just for the sake of showing our allegiance to the executive branch because it's not popular, it's not good politics. Like, our constituencies don't like us doing this and just banging on crypto incessantly."

But particularly for SAP 121, like, this is very inside baseball, only big boys care about this. Right. Like, in and of itself, this is not sexy legislation. This is also not something that most people are going to care about. Fit 21, which is this broader market infrastructure bill, which defines in large strokes how crypto is going to be regulated, whether by the CFTC or SEC, pushes more of the jurisdiction to the CFTC and sets up a lot of different rules and whatever was something we can talk about later when it gets up for a vote. But that's a very different kind of bill that I do think affects almost everything. Whereas SAP 121 was kind of, you know, without real political activation. Right. There was no big campaign around SAP 121. It's really all just, you know, look at the bill and see what makes sense. Nobody's scoring political points yet. That's what makes this seem so notable."

And that is a terrible issue to take up. And this, what, this is one of the first unclaimed true wedge issues of the last, like, 20 years. Everything else in american politics is so rote and routine and the battle lines have been drawn and everyone knows how they work and everyone knows the calculus of it, and everyone knows, you know, this social issue and that's economic issue and everyone knows the talking points. This is a goldmine of an untapped wedge issue that Trump came out for amidst really bad poll numbers for Biden. And it looked like it was just going to be, you know, one more advantage to tip the scales. And as a Biden voter, I mean, this is bad, right? Like, this is not what you want to see. You don't want to see the administration blow it on a wedge issue that could not only shape this election, but could also shape the battle lines of politics for the next couple elections.

So like Coinbase has run polls, paradigm has run polls, and they all kind of say that, hey, crypto is a real substantial populace that's going to vote on this basis.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So, okay, lets go from that to the ether ETF. So you all might remember the ether ETF. Long history of people applying for ether ETF, just like with bitcoin, although obviously not as long since first bitcoin ETF was before ether even existed. But bitcoin ETF got approved last year. Many people also filed, including Blackrock, for an ether ETF. And it was widely thought at the beginning of the year that the ether ETF was going to get approved under the same rubric as why the bitcoin ETF got approved. If you approve one, how could you not approve the other for spot trading? Then the SEC started stonewalling everybody. There was no movement on a lot of these applications. And people assumed because of some of the noises that have been made in back rooms about them investigating the Ethereum foundation, that maybe ether, they think ether is security or something. They're going to make some weird arguments to deny the Ethereum ETF's. And none of the issuers were getting any feedback, which usually means that, okay, this thing is going to die on the vine. There's been no engagement from the SEC. And so basically, a few days ago on polymarket, the prediction market, they were giving odds of roughly 10% that the Ether ETF was going to be approved. And then all of a sudden yesterday, everything flips. SEC starts engaging, they start telling the exchanges, hey, we think these are going to get approved. Get ready. They tell a bunch of the issuers, hey, please update your filings. And they give them a bunch of feedback, and all of a sudden the game is on. And it could be as soon as this week that we see Ethereum ETF's get approved. Basically we have till the end of this, sorry, what is it, the 23rd? So in a couple days, 25th, the 25th, 23rd, whatever, sometime this week, sometime this weekend, sometime this week, they have to give the response on the first tranche of ETF's. And we could have ETF's trading by the end of the month. Right now, polymarket is pricing it at 65%, basically under the belief that there's some chance that it drags or there's some kind of delay in the month of May. But more or less now, the market consensus that ether ETF's are going to get approved. Now, why did this happen all of a sudden? And the speculation broadly is that this is political. When something changes this fasten, it's because somebody in a high up place said, hey, shit, we got about face, there's a problem here. Figure out the details. And so this is probably not Gensler. This is maybe somebody above Gensler, such as perhaps the Biden administration, that thought, hey, we can't lose people on this. If we are broadly perceived as being antagonistic toward Ethereum and the Ethereum ETF, we're going to get even more of this stuff that we're losing ground to Trump on in the general election. So market is exuberant. Ether was up almost 20% a single day. Almost all alts have rallied on this basis under the thought that, okay, ether ETF is coming. What happened to bitcoin might also happen to ether, and maybe there's even more lying in wait after the ether ETF comes in. But also broadly, that maybe this is presaging a broader reversal in Biden's stance on crypto and that all crypto regulation might soften going into the rest of the year."

Trump is leaning into it. If you read his truth social or Twitter, because he's very focused on a prediction markets predicting him winning. And ironically, guess who is the likely person who is punting on poly market for this? It's ironically, you're a populist, meme coin trader person. Right? Like, if we're being honest, it's, it's a very overlapping demographic. And so I actually think Trump's numbers are coming from this sub demographic, which already was kind of inclined to like him. So I'm not saying it's like a conspiracy so much as like, if there is some numerical evidence and, you know, if you look at the only numerical events he seems to cite publicly, it seems to be prediction market data, I would, don't underestimate the value of this, how much that's influencing this.

And then we don't have to worry about what Biden's views are or what the SEC's views are or what the CFTC's views are or what the banking regulator views are. If we have bills on market structure and central bank digital currencies and like, you know, taxonomy and like all of these things, then what Biden's views are matter even less.

I think if Biden sees that the Democrats are largely aligning on like, hey, we need to chill out on crypto because it's kind of up, you know, like you said, Robert, there are many, many different races and a lot of them are going to end up defining the policy for Democrats broadly. I think we're just going to see that, like, hey, the consensus is more or less like, calm down on crypto, and I think you'll probably just follow that consensus. I think these things are very sticky. And when they turn, they sort of turn all at once. And that feels to me like what's maybe happening to crypto? We're seeing the first shoots of that obviously could be wrong, could reverse if we get something else really bad between now and the end of the year, it could fail to hold onto that consensus. But it kind of feels like assuming that things more or less play out as they are right now, that we're kind of on a straight march to the consensus bipartisan, is that we, crypto is here to stay and we got to stop trying to stamp it out. So we'll see how that plays out. Hopefully by this time next week we have an Ethereum ETF, and if so, we may see asset prices continue to rally. But there's another story that's been getting a lot of attention, a big debate among many people on crypto Twitter about these things called high FTV, low float tokens. So let's describe what this means. So high FTV FTV stands for fully diluted valuation basically means if you include all the tokens, including not just the tokens that currently are circulating, but all the tokens that could ever exist for a given coin, the FTV is basically saying, okay, what's the market cap if you include all those tokens that will ever exist? So these low float, high FTV tokens are basically these new tokens that have launched that supposedly have historically very low floats. So let's say a few percent, 5%, maybe even 10% of the fully diluted supply circulating, but a very large fully diluted valuation. So like 20 billion, 10 billion, something like that. So supposedly many of the tokens that have launched within the last six months on binance have had this low float, high FTV characteristics in their launch. And that cohort of tokens has done quite poorly. So if you just look at a chart of all those tokens launched in the last six months, they're mostly down into the right, down anywhere from roughly flat to down as much as 50 60%. And if you look on the other hand, at bitcoin, bitcoin's been up like 80 something percent in that same period of time. Ethereum has also been up a pretty decent amount. A lot of the big old ones have done pretty well, and meme coins have done very, very well. But this particular cohort of these quote unquote VC coins, generally VC backed the VC's and the teams owned a high percentage of the total supply. These have done fairly poorly. So there's been big debate on Twitter about what's causing this. Is this the VC's being greedy? Is this VC's dumping on retail? Is this retail rage, quitting and just buying meme coins instead of continuing to buy these VC coins that keep getting dumped on retail? Or is it a problem with perhaps too little supply for there to be meaningful price discovery? Is there some market structure problem that needs to get fixed? There's been a big debate. Many people are arguing about it. I posted something on Twitter over the weekend that got a bunch of love. Kobe has posted some stuff about it. Every VC seems to have an opinion, so let's maybe just go around and get some takes from. Obviously we're VC's, so we're going to have perhaps biased opinions on this conversation. Robert, what's your take? High FTV, low float?"

        "text": "Well, let me point out the absolute granddaddy OG high FTV low float digital asset bitcoin bitcoin started off with an extremely small portion of the float growing over time in a semi linear fashion, a decreasing linear fashion. But bitcoin is the OG low FTv high flow. You can talk and justify for a lot of different reasons why that worked extremely successfully and how it's different from the current crop of low float high FTV tokens. The current crop of low float high FTV tokens are things where teams release a spec of them to the community, own 90 something percent or at least whatever, and it turns into a mess because the whole project, so to speak, is just owned by a couple people. And the increase in the float really just comes from them, not from other mechanics. Bitcoin at least was constructed in a far superior fashion, in that 100% of the increase in the float came from mining and proof of work. But bitcoin is the first model and at least there's a justifiable construct for low float high FTP, which is you start off with 0% in circulation and it goes up to 100% slowly over time."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Well, I'll preface by saying I think every asset in every market deals with this market structure problem. Like there's a reason why ipos are structured in a way that are low float, high ftv. Okay. When there's a ipo, only the ipo participants have their float, and then six months later everyone can dump. Its similar in public equity markets in a lot of ways as well. And so I dont think were so far off base here as an industry. I think theres deep issues. Theres deep issues where some project releases 5% of his tokens and then does this high five we did it type situation and that 5% trades for a ridiculous valuation because people think that thats the supply of the token. And then it's like, haha, there's 95% to go and we're going to sell it into the market. That's where there's issues. But I don't think the overall construct of, oh, only some portion of this is tradable today. Is that bad? I think there's a lot of corollaries that haven't turned out to be disasters that do work quite well. It's just, I think the way it's happening in a couple different projects is just not working. I mean, the long term dynamics of it are just bad. If it's like, okay, well, like, you know, there's going to be a high degree of inflation every single year, you know, like over four years. Those four years are going to look ugly, potentially."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Tarun, what's your take iftv low float?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I mean, okay, what's the point of having that ratio of like high ftv, low float is that you have a subsidy, which is you're paying out as a either a block reward or a liquidity reward, or for some action like committing a resource, committing a node, committing hardware, committing liquidity. You are earning some, usually pro rata, but sometimes not fraction of this emission. And it's a form of a subsidy, and it's a form of a unique subsidy that doesn't exist in normal securities markets because normal securities markets don't have continuous emission. There's no continuous emission of GameStop as a function of price. Instead there's GameStop. Price goes up. GameStop management says we want to inflate the supply by x and tries to vote and push it through very quickly and causes the boom to crash. I think one very unique thing about programmable digital assets, which is pretty much only crypto, because most fintech is lipstick on a pig and you can't do this type of stuff very easily, is that you can control these emissions and you can make them dynamic and respond to events. In bitcoin's case, the emissions responded to, hey, we've produced too many blocks over a two week period. We have a mechanism for reducing the amount by changing difficulty so that we hit a sort of target usage rate while matching this inflation curve. In the case of Ethereum, it's like, hey, we have a target amount of stake we want to hit, and we lower the emissions as there's too much stake as a percentage of the total float. Now the subsidy. The reason I bring this up is, well, the subsidy has to do something, right? And I think there's a very natural tendency, especially for those who are maybe not trying to build a real technology, but maybe want to copy pasta fork something. Or they're just like, hey, I want to scam someone to just basically say, like, look, this subsidy can make me rich quickly if I can sell some fraction of it quickly, but I never find a use case for it. The problem is, if there's no natural reason for people to lock assets that are worth something, whether it's electricity, in the case of mining, whether it's ethereum, in the case of proof of stake, whether it's storage, in the case of filecoin or arweave, et cetera, then you have this problem that there's really no reason to hold it other than future inflation rewards. It doesnt have any baseline collateral that it can be compared to. And so then its basically a meme coin at that point, right. And so if we look at this spectrum of things that are pure meme coins, theres no fundamental value that you earn from locking a resource and potentially earning fees or a right to some future fees in the network. Then these high FTV, low float things, maybe they have a lot of marketing that is focused on their technology, but they're really meme coins. And they're not actually, they don't need the subsidy. The service that's being offered doesn't need a subsidy either. People are willing to do it for free, or almost free, or there's just no valuable long term service. And it's just that the token is the long term service at that point, then it feels like a meme coin. And so I think the reason people are upset is a lot of investors funded a lot of infrastructure. Some of maybe the less technically bright investors just copied other investors and invested in copypasta competitors. As you go down the hierarchy of the copypasta ness, the lower down ones, they just don't really have that much of a need for a subsidy because they don't even have a real network. So what do they do? They effectively turn into these kind of weird meme coins. And so thats sort of what my point is, that if you have this subsidy that youre planning out over a long time via some type of inflation emissions, you need that subsidy to really attract real resources, real services, real usage. And if that doesnt happen, then you basically made a meme coin. And I think its the movie past."

There's the, the high fdv, low float. That's real utility in the long run, real network effect. You have to subsidize the network in order to get to grow. And then once it's sustainable, it survives and then everything else in meme coin. But in reality, there's a lot of gradations and people have done a lot of things to play with this, where you have partial utility, but that utility almost doesn't need to be subsidized because your main net is almost a test net. It doesn't really have real fees, it doesn't really have real usage, and people aren't really locking it. People are getting risk free return for some period of time before they're actually taking risk operating your network, because they're taking risk operating your network, you're subsidizing them. That's the fair trade. I think, because of that, there's this fine line where people are like, look, we're going to eventually launch. And that eventual launch keeps getting delayed and delayed and delayed, and now it's like, well, is it ever going to happen? And I think that's the thing. People are most kind. At least my read of what people are saying is that that's the thing they're most angry about. It's like they effectively got this thing that doesn't work. Now, you could argue that, yeah."

Token or governance maybe token or the way the token is used is to attract capital. But then there's no way of getting liquidity on that capital. So that's the one type of thing that people were unhappy with tagging there. But my point is, if you're an operational network, there should not be these liquidity constraints. I should be able to join and leave. I should be able to find an equilibrium."

I think that the problem is, unlike in ICos, where retail could buy in, by the time a lot of these projects launch, the FTV or the market cap is so high that there just isn't enough appetite to have the thing go any higher. It's already priced to perfection. And in some ways I agree. I think, first of all, low float, theres a huge range there. You have the 1% Sam tokens classically from 2021, rest in peace. And then you have stuff like 10%, which is more in line with the IPO market. But to be fair, part of the difference with an IPO market is it is not price to perfection, right. Theyre not trying to exactly hit market pricing, they are trying to leave an IPO pop. And so people who are buying in feel like, oh, this thing goes up, I got a good deal, whatever, I'm excited about it. And so it's this weird sort of market inefficiency where it's almost like you want to leave money on the table so that people who are buying in feel like there's still upside to have, and right now there just isn't that."

Most of these things are of not liquid. VC's have multi year vests. None of the investors, none of the team are actually selling the tokens. I think the problem is straight up that traders who are buying these tokens at these ftvs is just not sustainable. This is way over where the market should be pricing these things and they're sort of coming back down to earth where they should be priced. And so I don't think anyone has really anyone to blame other than themselves. Or maybe something, broadly speaking, broken with market structure as to like why there isn't earlier opportunity for retail to invest in these products, but that's sort of a whole other can of worms."

And then I heard a bunch of VC's also parroting this of like oh, there's this big market structure problem. And then I was like, this is stupid. This is just sensationalism. And I wrote this big piece over the weekend, more or less debunking what I see as the most popular theories of why these tokens went down to Tom. As you mentioned, it's not teams dumping or VC's dumping because none of these things have unlocked. None of these things are even a year old. So it's possible maybe some of them, I've heard some stories about individual ones where they have super short lock ups like these chinese quick flip type investments, or places where maybe the team is hedging on perps or something like that. But if you look at the charts, almost all these tokens went down in April around the same time, which basically tells you theres no way its coordinated dumping from every VC and every single one of these tokens. Then theres also the story that retailers is buying meme coins now. And thats also not true. Thats something that Tarun talks about a lot of like oh, all the people who are buying meme coins. I pulled up the volumes on binance and binance. About 14% of the trading volume on binance is meme coins. And of course binance trades way more volume than anything traded on chain. It's something like 50% of the total spot market is just binance. So it's true that there are a lot of people trading a lot of meme coins and it's a brand new thing to be at the scale that it is now. It's way bigger than nfts were on a trading volume basis and way more people."

My point is that meme coins don't explain why these high FTV, low float things are happening. And then the third point that I made was that these tokens are not actually high FTV, low float. The ftvs are actually in a totally normal range. If you normalize for etherprice, Solana, Avax, Nier were all roughly in the same vicinity at the time that they launched as these new projects. And the floats are actually totally normal. So the average float of that cohort is about 13%, which is very similar to what it was in previous cycles. Its also almost exactly the same as the average IPO in 2023, which is 12.8%. Theres a lot of alarmism, theres a lot of desire to pin the tail of the donkey and say, oh, it's market maker's fault, it's binance's fault, it's VC's fault, it's Kols fault. Because when markets go down, everyone wants someone to blame. And I think the reality is the market just went down for fancy, shiny new altcoins, and there's no bigger, beautiful, magical explanation, there's no big reform that needs to happen. It just, markets are perfect at this. They just figure it out by repricing everything and making the numbers go down. Uh, my argument has been that I think everybody is freaking out, um, for more or less, for, for no real reason. And if there was a market structure problem, everything that we're describing was also true in 2022, it was also true in 2020, it was also true in 2018. So if it was a market structure problem, then it's been six years of this market structure. And, you know, it'd be weird for it all to suddenly start happening now. So.

Okay, so very briefly, we're going to talk about this very weird, interesting story about the DOJ charging two brothers in a $25 million mev bot exploit. Okay. This is the first time MeV has ever shown up in a DOJ indictment. So here's the story. Very high level. We're going to move through this pretty quick because we don't have a ton of time. These two brothers who went to, I think, MIT, both software engineers, and they both worked. Where do they work? I don't know. Somewhere. Anyway, there was an exploit in MeV Boost, which is the software that Ethereum validators run in order to extract MeV programmatically, using basically an off chain auction to extract MeV. If you don't know what that means. Sorry, we probably don't have enough time to explain all of that on the show. But basically they were able to go in, exploit a bug in this software to allow them to take these transactions that were supposed to be sent as a complete bundle and unbundle them, basically strip them apart, and arbitrage some of the individual transactions in order to make a bunch of money. So they more or less made this money extracting it from other bots that were trying to extract money from other retail users. So it's a little bit weird, right? So you've got these arbitrageurs who are more or less trying to fuck over retail users, or I, according to the DOJ, protect the integrity of the ethereum ecosystem by fucking over retail users. And these guys extracted their transactions, reordered them, and basically attacked the attackers or sandwiched the sandwichers or Robin Hood. The Robin Hooders or. I don't know. I guess. Not that that one doesn't make sense, but that's more or less what happened. Okay, so this was covered, I think, I don't know, like a year ago, $25 million that they made in this attack. Then they created multiple shell companies and private addresses, and they try to hire lawyers, and they looked up extradition treaties, and they basically knew immediately that what they did was probably legal. And were googling to that effect. And all that showed up in the DOJ indictment. So this indictment dropped just about a week ago, and everybody seemed to be very, very surprised that, hey, this kind of seems like sort of crypto and crypto violence, not the kind of thing the DOJ generally concerns itself with. You know, this is not hacking a retail protocol. This is not North Korea. This is not anything else is kind of like maybe in the neighborhood of sophisticated players attacking other sophisticated players. It's almost like hedge funds, you know, screwing over other hedge funds or something. So people were a little bit surprised to see this. Now, clearly, these people were exploiting a bug and maliciously using this and also trying to cover their tracks. So this doesn't really seem like they thought what they were doing was legal, but it seems pretty surprising to have this kind of thing showing up in a DOJ indictment. And the amount of sophistication that the DOJ showed in explaining what exactly is going on in these very kind of minutia corners of the of the MEV market also seemed very surprising to people. So I was chatting with somebody who actually knows one of these two brothers. They, like, went to map camp with them."

We didn't know them very well and was very surprised to see them show up here in a DOJ indictment. So, Tarun, you said that you also know both the brothers or one of the brothers."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I know. What's your take on the story? Yeah, I know one of the brothers. I also know the victim. So, basically, the idea is the, there's a thing called a sandwich attack. And the very dumb way of thinking about sandwich attack is it's sort of your classic front running type of thing, where someone sees your order and they see that youre willing to fill your order until a price thats higher than the current market price. So they push up the price until the maximum that youre willing to pay in your order and then execute your order and then sell back, which basically means they push the price up, they use your order to push the price up a little more, and then they sell back, and so they they can get a profit. And so in automated market makers like uniswap and things like that, this is a very kind of relatively straightforward calculation of how to do this. There's an argument that this is potentially good and bad, and we'll get to that in a second. But basically, a lot of people view sandwich attacks as bad for retail in the same way that people view citadel filling Robinhood orders as bad for retail. It's a very similar kind of thing. I think the difference."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So this is why I find this kind of entire case a little bit weird. When I worked in high frequency trading, a lot of trading strategies you do, the whole point is, like, you try to measure signals from book updates and also messages of, like, failed orders, or guess what the failed order rate is. And based on that, try to find signals to do not so different things to sandwich attacks. So I would say market making has a lot of very similar strategies. So I think it's just more, those are not very public, where sandwich attacks have papers written by many people, including myself. So there's sort of like, it's a very. It's a very well studied thing where it's like, you know, these trading strategies people are using aren't public. I don't know if you follow the millennium versus Jane street trial recently. That's a great example of this. But anyway, the idea is there's sandwich attacks. There's an auction that is run every block where people pay for the right to get their bundle of transactions in. In fact, actually, people pay for that to get a block, and then people bid on whole blocks. And the person who has the right, the proposer, the validator person running a node, who's chosen, picks a block. And so these searchers, these people who try to find sandwich attacks and then submit these orders, they submit it to these block builders and get their orders in. So the interesting thing is, this is sort of a second order thing where the people who are sandwich attackers got sandwiched themselves. So someone was able to see all of their orders, break them apart, and put them in the wrong order such that someone else made the money and they kind of lost the money. So last year at Ethereum Community conference in Paris, at this mev event where I was speaking, because I've written a lot of papers on formalizing this stuff, this guy comes up to me and sort of starts talking to me and is like, hey, you have this paper that says sandwich tax can be good sometimes because they cause certain types of efficiency for liquidity providers. I was a victim of this attack. And I was like, you're the unbundling victim, which is this thing that the DOJ went after. And he was like, yes. Also, first off, not a US national, very much a EU national, which is why I thought this was a weird case for the DOJ to go after. And he's like, yes, so I want to sue the people who did it because I've had gotten enough analytics between kind of exchanges and other things who I was like, hey, this happened and I sort of have a good idea who it is and I want to sue them, but I need an expert witness to basically say. To basically can say sandwich attacks aren't bad. Which is sort of my paper shows in some. It doesn't say sandwich attacks aren't bad. Uniformly. My paper. What shows, shows this. This thing that says sandwich attacks are sometimes good. They actually, sometimes you, you, the individual user might get a worse price, but the network at large, many orders might actually do better on average in some scenarios. And so he's like, yeah, I want to, like, make sure the, the civil case doesn't view sandwich attacks as bad, but views sandwiching, the sandwich attackers as bad. And he explicitly said this to me. And I was like, I have no desire to. First off to, oh, you didn't part of this?"

I remember we were talking about speculations of how the person found the bug. So in hindsight, I thought that was very funny because obviously he knows how they found it. But, yeah, the weird part to me, and this is one of those things where I feel like the law and what's actually happening are quite separate, is like, I agree, all the stuff they did post hoc to try to hide the money probably is really what got them in. But the stuff that they exactly did reminds me a lot of things people do in high frequency trading in how they co locate stuff, how they try to look at which endpoints in the network are of being used the most and then flooding them so that someone else can't send packets. There's all sorts of little microstructure stuff that the regulators definitely don't know about. Like, I went to an Eric Buddish talk at this conference I hosted last week, and he's like, oh, yeah, we just got the first ever cancel message data. I'm like, all right, you guys are never finding anything for another ten years in terms of what people are doing. But my point is, I kind of get this feeling that there's this. This thing was like a weird thing. We're so technically sophisticated that people were like, it has to be fraud. Whereas I think there's a lot of other things that are much worse. But yeah, it's a very weird thing to be, like, this type of thing that you're doing to another user's transaction is not illegal, like the sandwich attack front running them. But if you violate the frontrunner's desire of where they want it to be in a block, you're suddenly. It's suddenly like manipulating the sanctity of Ethereum. That part I still don't. I haven't been able to wrap my head around the argument, and I get all the other wire fraud stuff at the end. Totally makes sense. I get that. But that's where I'm kind of lost."

In my mind, that doesn't sort of sound the same, right. You were giving these people information. They took it, and they did something with it. There was no contract. There was no sort of explicit agreement that this is how it was going to work. It was just, you were participating in this thing and that's it. Having the bug and then exploiting that feels like actually the issue here. And again, what the DOJ is going after versus, hey, you were sandwiching the sandwichers, or hey, you had some sort of malicious PvP trade. That is not the issue. It's more this hackath.

But in this scenario, it's actually sort of a weird probabilistic attack. In fact, the fix that was done doesn't fix it perfectly. It's the nature of this thing that it's like a latency race. And what it boils down to is if I can get enough information about the block the proposer chose before, the rest of the network is able to get that block and confirm it. Like, they vote that, hey, two thirds of people vote, two thirds of stake votes that this is the right block and I can submit another block and I'm the same proposer and flood the network with that. And yes, I'll get slashed because I proposed two blocks, but the slashing penalty might be much lower than the MEV I took. It still works. And all they did is adding this delay.

So the reality is that a lot of law gets decided in effect, by just, like, individual people doing stupid things where in the absence of a great case like this, probably it would still remain a gray area. And maybe if two hedge funds had gotten penalized for doing this, they'd have so much better legal representation that this would have ended up a civil case and the DOJ would never have gone after them."

I actually feel like that makes total sense. Or even like a. Yeah, I. I was surprised that it went to this level of criminal case. When you see if they're doing this, I would say that there's a lot of other stuff that's going on in normal markets, that probably should be considered the same."
