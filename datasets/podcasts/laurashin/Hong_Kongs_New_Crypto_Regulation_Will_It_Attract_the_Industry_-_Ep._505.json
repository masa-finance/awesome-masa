I spent a number of years at the securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong as a director of enforcement as well as a director of supervision of markets, and I set up the compliance function at Hong Kong exchanges and clearing. So I've spent quite a bit of time in the regulatory space and work very closely with the SFC and regulators around Asia Pacific."

After setting up the compliance function at HCAC and setting up their foundation, I was approached by headhunters who asked me did I know anything about bitcoin? And since I had advised Bitfinex in early 2013 about setting up an exchange, I did say, yes, I knew, and I was recruited by that headhunter to become the global coo for Bitmex. So I was thrown into what was probably one of the most interesting jobs in the world at the time to set up everything for Arthur Hayes and his team. And I was a global coo there. So that's how I got even more deep into digital assets."

I started to do a bit of prop trading, obviously lost most of my money actually doing prop trading in ico. If was going up to $1,400, I held it to $80. Actually listen to Albert Hayes as well. Albert Hayes saying that it should be double digit for Eve and kind of losing hope a bit of in crypto and looking at from different perspectives. I started a company called liquify doing tokenizations. It was a time for STo. So back into 2017, I think I was too early for that. But I actually looked into a lot of regulations, quite early, developed regulations around Asia for stos. And until 2021, I decided to reenter as an investor. And I started Newman Capital, mostly doing investment and venture side of things in US Southeast Asia and looking back at Hong Kong because of what is so exciting over the past twelve months in terms of regulations evolving not just in Hong Kong, but overall in the region. So portfolios of us, whether it's in us or elsewhere, is trying to move to Hong Kong. And that's sort of why me and my team is looking much more into how we can help out. Not just talking to regulator, but also the government side of things. But Angelina has been the pioneer in this space. So happy to be on this podcast with you."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And just to clarify, these are the executives of Bitfinex."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yes, they were the two founders of Bitfinex, and they were very excited and wanted to set up an exchange in Hong Kong. And since I had come from regular regulating exchanges at the SFC, the Securities and Futures Commission, I was introduced to them to help them set up, and I said, I'm sorry, we don't have any regulations such as this. But I guess if you wanted to start, I guess it's something that you can think about. So they did end up starting their Bitfinex exchange, and that was the start of one of the major exchanges. And you know that, of course, other exchanges started elsewhere, Mount Cox in Japan and so on and so forth. But what happened was we didn't have any legislation at all, and that was the start of, with Bitmex starting its derivatives exchange. And then other exchanges like FTX also took the lead in Hong Kong, roughly in about 2016, 2017, all of these founders started work on their exchanges. There were no regulations whatsoever. And in fact, when I joined BitMex, there was a lot of derision by market participants and regulators that, why would a ex regulator join digital assets like me? Oh, my God, has she gone crazy? Because, again, bitcoin was looked at as a negative thing. It was looked upon as a scam and so on and so forth. But what happened was you had the ascendancy of digital assets and interest in it, and Bitmex, of course, took the lead. Binance also was growing. FTX was also growing at the same time, then crypto.com dot. So going into 2018 2019, almost all the major exchanges had set up in Hong Kong because of the low tax regime. Again, regulators started looking at it, but they really didn't want to do anything about regulating it, nor did they really know about it. The CFTC did try to get the SFC to take some investigations forward, but they were not successful because it was so hard to investigate digital assets. So it wasn't until roughly 2020 did things start getting a little bit strained, I should say. The SFC started to put in an opt in regulatory procedure whereby you could actually put in an application and possibly get a license. The first one to do that was OSDH, and the second was Hashkey at the time. So the SFC had issued these rules, and other firms started looking into getting into it. But the first one, of course, that was approved later was OSL, and then about a year later, Hashkey was also approved. So finally, the SFC started getting, I won't say worried, but more concerned, and started to publish more legislation in this area. And one of the initiatives that was proposed was to ban all retail investors from investing in digital assets. Now, at that time, I was at the FSDC, and we brought up this issue to the Financial Services Development Council. And at that time, we also told them that if this would happen, most of the houses, the golden unicorns that had started in Hong Kong, would probably move away. And that included Bitmex, Crypto.com, who did eventually move away, finance, and of course, Bitmex and other houses. So the FSDC, under King Ao and Rocky Tung, undertook a review of the digital asset business. We had a very high level meeting, which all the houses came and basically told everything to them about their difficulties in opening accounts and so on and so forth. Insurance or lack of insurance, visas that weren't able to be gotten because the company did not have licenses. So all of these were taken into account. And I'm sorry, I'm telling you a longer story, but in the beginning, there wasn't much interest. Later, when Chris Hoey became the new secretary for financial services, he took a very big interest in this area, convinced the SFC to start looking into this and take it as a real asset. So by 2021, there was discussions of whether or not to allow retail at that time, again, the door slammed and they stopped allowing retail to trade. That thought process was still there. But then just last year, as you saw with the consultation conclusions, there was a vast sea change. And I think what really was the major decision maker was that John Lee came into power. Chris, the secretary for financial service, worked with the new administration to speak to China to allow Hong Kong to be the regulatory sandbox. And as such, the SFC also about faced and allowed retail to be traded. And because of this, we're seeing a huge enthusiasm back into Hong Kong, where a lot of digital asset players are coming back to Hong Kong, and you're seeing web three and a lot of new innovation coming back in. And I think this is something that both the Hong Kong government wanted. And I think, of course, China is very pro making sure that Hong Kong can succeed and will succeed. So I think these are two very positive pieces of news. Sorry, a little bit longer than expected. Sorry."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I think Angelina have given a full download basically for the past ten years. In terms of regulations. Well, I think Hong Kong, I'll try to come from a different perspective, more from the community building and overall the commercial perspective, because I was in touch with crypto back to 2013, actually, when Juhan Chu from kinetic brought Vitalik to Hong Kong. So he called me and said, there is an interesting meetup, you should go. And I went there. There were just five people. So Hong Kong was as early as when Vitalik came to Hong Kong. We have no one really heard about Ethereum, but it was one of the targeted cities for the early ogs, crypto ogs, actually. And going back to 2017, so fast forward to 2017, because I was in front of the screen trading crypto in October of 2017, which China banned crypto trading and bitcoin mining at that time. So there was an influx of players from China, whether it's OKX, whether it's binance, Huawei to Hong Kong. So I think for two, three years, Hong Kong was treated as a place that you want to be there because there was no regulation. Ironically, the regulation is clear now, but at that time, people came here because our regulations was much slower, much slower than other jurisdictions. So people, it's ironic that some of the biggest companies, whether it is FTX at that time, including Alameda, crypto.com, not anymore. At that time yet. But OKX, Huawei, all of them actually had kind of like the headquarters in Hong Kong and the main people were in Hong Kong until I think Angelina already mentioned some major consultations or kind of views were presented by the regulator. So companies in cryptos realized that Hong Kong is going to do something, whether it's good or bad. At that time, I think the sign of being good, sign of a positive sign from regulator just was presented last year. But before that, it was confusing for the industry. But confusing sometimes is good for industry because they kind of feel like we are not going anywhere extreme. Until last year, obviously there was a good sign in the Hong Kong fintech. We announced on the Hong Kong fintech week. It was so different from before because if Angelina and us, we were in the industry for a long time, there was no another time that whether it's the SFC or the financial secretary or Chris Ho or any level from the government came out and said, we are going to push we in a bit conservatively, but also positively. Last two weeks I have some insight closed door meetings with the government as well with senior levels. I think one major question that everyone wants to ask all the time is has China endorsed Hong Kong pushing web free? So there's obviously not a public answer out there. But I think the government official already talked to Beijing quite a lot on this and have the kind of go for it signed from the Beijing government, which is very encouraging because as commercially, every portfolio will ask, will it be different from before that, you know, or is it the same from before that a ban will happen if some illegal activities or something negative happen for industry? Will Hong Kong just do it 180 degree turn if something happens? So I think it's not the case because the government really has a positive view on pushing it up."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I agree with Adrian completely. I don't think there's going to be ever again another 180 degree turn, but there will be enforcement actions by the SFC if people break the rules once the licenses are in place. So we can expect that it's going to be a thriving industry, but one that takes care of its investors and grows to be a real asset class, which we've always known it's a real asset class, but now it's really going to be a developed asset class in Hong Kong, which is highly exciting."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. So let's dive now into these new rules. So on June 1, the Hong Kong securities and Futures Commission, as we've been discussing, began accepting applications for virtual asset service providers to serve retail customers. What is it that these new rules."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Say, jump in at any time, Adrian. But in a nutshell, basically, if you wish to offer digital assets in Hong Kong, you must be licensed. The licensing regime is based on same product, same as what is being done with securities and futures. You will get a license and you will have to comply with rules and regulations. You will need to put in internal controls that are documented, which to me are best practice in any ways that you would want to put in place. You will need to take care of your customers. They will need to be suitable to be able to understand digital assets. There will be segregated accounts, there's security over how the firms run. You will have a number of requirements to keep minimum capital so the firm will not go bankrupt. And there will be requirements for responsible officers that will look after the firm and be responsible for the firm. So very much the same way that securities firms are run in Hong Kong, the SFC will require the same of digital asset firms that are getting licenses. And already it's proven the system works. We already have licensed companies in Hong Kong, both in the fund management space as well as OTC broking. Those that are brokers can uplift their licenses to be able to offer digital assets through a licensed digital asset provider, like OSL, for example. And then the new trading firms that are coming in the digital asset exchanges, people from binance, from what we hear, all the way to new firms that are setting up in Hong Kong, will be able to get licenses or already have put in licenses."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, and one other requirement that I just wanted to flag for those people who have been scarred by things like Mount Cox and FTX is that there's a cold storage requirement of 98% of the coins need to be held in cold storage, which I think is a really great regulation. So, Adrian, can you describe what it is that they can list in terms of the tokens or what requirements the tokens have to meet?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I believe the tokens need to have a twelve month track record. So listed probably elsewhere for twelve months, issue for twelve months. And, well, jumping back a bit, well, the regulations, I think, is encouraging because they actually mimic quite exactly what the traditional security law in Hong Kong serves. So basically, if you are a traditional broker or traditional asset managers in Hong Kong, obviously you have a standard way to deal with SFC in terms of your activities. So when you look at the guideline issued by, not the guideline, but the new law issued by SFC in terms of license seven, which is the trading trading facilities in Hong Kong, I think it's pretty similar to traditional way of dealing with the. But also in the same time, it takes care of specific things that you will think about in crypto, just same as the question that you asked in terms of the token, whether you have, I think it has to be a twelve month track record, including in certain two indexes. I think at least two indexes when you look through that universe. And obviously with the query requirement. But one thing pretty interesting is they always require the platform operator to do due diligence. So that is one key thing. So you can never, you never think about you as a company getting a license, and you could do whatever, you basically have the fiduciary to do the due diligence. Same as any kind of broker, if you get a license as a broker, you need to do due diligence in terms of what you're selling to your clients. So I think that will impose certain requirement on exchanges. Even licensed is trying to list the token. So you heard some of the exchanges in the market already say they got at least 16 tokens. Whether it is true they already get approval already. Talk to a regulator at the end, I think they have the discretion, but up to whether something happens. And if they haven't done the proper due diligence, they will be punished by the regulator. So I think the regulator has given a kind of a pull and push approach, so given a bit of flexibility out there with the guidance you need to follow, but at the end, you have to bear your responsibility as the operator yourself."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And so, I mean, to me that seems like a high bar to have. The coins need to be listed in two different independent indexes, and one needs to be a provider that has experience in the traditional financial sector. So how many assets, like you mentioned, 16. So which assets do you expect will be offered? Like how limited do you think it will be compared to what we currently see on, like, binance?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, Angelina, obviously you have your own comments as well, but I have questions. When I look at the 16 coins, I think it was announced by one exchange out there, some tokens. I do have questions on why they could be listed, which tokens were those sandbox tokens. I would do have questions on in terms of the volatility liquidity and whether it should be traded on platform day one. Well, I'm not sure. I'm not saying that it's not gonna, it shouldn't be traded for five months later, but from, from an investor perspective, I think it is the first five tokens, bitcoin, ether, and probably some of the bigger, bigger ones, except stable coins because stable coins are not allowed to trade now on the Hong Kong exchanges. But some of the tokens like send is probably a bit dangerous for day one. As I mentioned, it's a discretion for a platform operator to list them as long as you have the license approved."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Finally, so if you were an operator, which you were saying that you would be comfortable with five, which five? Bitcoin ether. And then which are the other three?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, let me look up the top ten now. Actually, bitcoin ether is obviously the choice, but not excluding the stable coins, probably not BNB for now. Solana Polygon not top ten, but could be safer choices than listing some of the application based tokens. So I think foundation based token probably is the easier ones to get listed initially and is the less volatility compared to some of the application based tokens as well."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So Laura, one of Laura and Adrian, one of the new areas which is quite novel that has been introduced as a part of the regulation is the fact that the onus has been put on the firm to take responsibility. So therefore a new criterion has been put in place that requires the firm to have an admissions committee, so that admissions committee has to meet if it wishes to list a specific token. Adrian has mentioned some of the characteristics that can be used as a part of the diligence process, but the most important thing is the firm will need to take responsibility and the responsible officers will need to take responsibility for this. So a due diligence list of why the firm has made these decisions to allow bitcoin and ethereum to be listed that the fact that they are listed on two or three exchanges or different products, or they're approved somewhere else. All of that, that information and background has to be in the report that actually is tendered to this admissions committee. And all of that needs to be minuted by the licensed person. And why is the SFC taking such a stance on this? Is because they do not and they did not approve the product unlike any other product in Hong Kong. If you offer a fund in Hong Kong that has to be licensed by the Investment Products division of the SFC, it will be authorized and there will be all sorts of documentation on why the SFC approved that product. But for bitcoin, for ether, none of this has been approved by the SFC. It just appeared because of Satoshi Nakamoto or Vitalik Buterin. And it's up to the firm then to take the responsibility. And if the firm lacks that documentation and that due diligence, I think the SFC will take action, maybe in the beginning, giving a bit of leeway, but firms will need to get their paperwork and due diligence in line to make sure that they protect investors. And I think that's a very novel way of making sure that firms make sure that they have the analysis before allowing a sand or a doggy coin or whatever it is to be unleashed on investors. Investor protection is in place. So that's just building on what Adrienne was saying. But this was a very unusual and new way of looking at things, which I thought was quite interesting, and I asked Elizabeth at length. Elizabeth is the young lady who did the policy and wrote the policy and."

        "text": "People running it will be licensed and be held accountable, and you will know exactly who is running the firm and that they will be located in Hong Kong. So it's very clear whether or not they're going to be licensed or not, and it'll be very clear, unlike what happened with FTX, of where are you going to get recompense. If you've opened an account in Hong Kong, then you can take action. In Hong Kong, the regulator will take action if you complain, and there'll be a way that you can grab onto something. Whereas if you know, with FTX now, for those of the people that have taken losses, Hong Kong investors, because they didn't sign up with a Hong Kong license company, we're at the last in the line to get any recompense, if anything, from the FTX proceedings that are going on in the United States. But in the United States and Bahamas, they will actually get the first bite of the cherry in terms of funds going back to the aggrieved investors. So that's a very, very big difference to protect investors. Sorry, I'm talking a lot. Adrian, did you want to add in stuff or."

Reflect on the RO level. Also reflect on the company level, which is quite unusual, as Angelina mentioned, that you approved internally based on due diligence and certain token get listed. But at the end, is the company to be blamed? It's quite a different approach from rest of the other kind of companies to be regulated."

So I'm going to be very careful with the decisions that I make. I'm going to make sure that the company is protected as well as investors are protected because I don't want to be carted off to jail. And you have seen actions being taken against responsible officers who have been derelict in their duties. And I mean, that's a firm is as strong as the people that run it. And that's why that regime is in place. And this is to make sure that digital assets as a licensed activity will be good for investors and will protect investors. And I think that's the great part of all of this because we're on our pathway to become really an accepted asset class, at least in Hong Kong and in Asia Pacific."

Something that was really interesting to me was that I read that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is even urging banks to open accounts for crypto companies, which, given everything that has happened recently in the US with Silvergate and Signature bank and even Silicon Valley Bank a little bit, and the debanking of a bunch of crypto companies here, it just seemed like a geopolitical play, I guess you could say. So I was wondering, is that kind of activity actually drawing crypto firms? And given what we were talking about in terms of this sort of limited kind of space in which to play with all the different regulations, is, is all of this actually attracting crypto companies?"

        "text": "Well, definitely. Well, but there's always a question. So when these things happen on the news and her portfolio asking, is that real? Because usually people have a pretty skeptical towards what's happening in Hong Kong, because over the past several years we have been talking about how we can propel crypto, but at the end of the day, we know that it was real this time, but people outside of Hong Kong doesn't know it's real. So put it this way, I think there was a Bloomberg article coming out when silvergates of those banks got shot at that time, and when chinese banks is trying to recruit crypto companies for bank accounts and Bloomberg was doing that news. Actually, I was contacted by Bloomberg on that as well, but I was not sure whether it's real or nothing because when I talked to all these chinese banks at that time, I think there was conversations for not too senior level with the RM's, I mean, relationship managers with clients in terms of getting open up bank accounts. So I was still not convinced it was more policies in place or a narrative in place that banks are going to open up crypto accounts until, I think some of the even virtual banks in Hong Kong talk about it. So you see there's spread of these kind of messaging across news outlet and banks started talking about that. I think portfolios start to get comfortable and even until I think last two weeks, some of our portfolios want to open a bank account, just operating bank account. So it's not crypto in and out all days, but just a crypto company. Trying to open a bank account with banks is actually getting easier. So believe it or not, I think the relationship managers three years ago, you talk to them, not as a crypto company. You talk to them and tell them you are a technology consulting company or your technology advisor company to get rid of that. Even though your whole website is blockchain this and that, if you get a brand as an RM, then you probably could still make it happen. But I think this, these days, if you open up as a crypto company's operating bank account, the RM actually takes your call. So I think it's pretty encouraging."

There's a second meeting which I've just received an invitation for that will be held in a few weeks. I think I forgot the date, but this will also be to expedite bank accounts. And I think the HKMA has taken it very seriously. So if you're definitely licensed, are on the road to being licensed, you will be able to get a bank account. It's for the ones that are in the process of getting licensed. That will take a little bit longer, but I'm sure that if you showed evidence of your license application or things like that, I think banks will probably start moving towards getting you banked up. The other area that was really, really difficult for licensed companies was to get insurance. So you had to think of really unusual ways to get insurance to fulfill a requirement of the licensing regime. So you'd get specie license. That was pretty much useless if you can show an insurance policy at least that fulfilled it. Now the insurance regulators as well as the Federation of insurers are actually working with FSDC to talk to insurance companies so that digital asset firms can get insurance. So all of these are slowly working through the system. And I have to say, thanks to work from the FSDC as well as the SSDC and HKMA working together to move this with invest Hong Kong. All of this has just pushed it along, which has been a lot better. And I think the government realizes that, hey, people, the smartest of smart, the digital asset firm owners, are leaving Hong Kong. That means tech people are going to get pulled away. And there were a lot of people going to Dubai. There were a lot of people going back to the US, Austin, Texas. And I think now we sort of. Yeah, now, well, maybe it's the other way around now with the thing with Gary Gensler's newest case, but nevertheless, I think that stem of leaving has sort of stopped, thankfully, and people are thinking about coming back, which is very, very good for Hong Kong."

So are there any other areas of Hong Kong crypto regulation that you foresee maybe happening in the future could be around, I don't know, like nfts or trying to track developers or, I don't know, tokens. Do you see anything else on the horizon?"

Whether it's digital Hong Kong, I'm not talking about existing stablecoin provider outside of Hong Kong tether or other stable one provider, but digital Hong Kong D or offshore renminbi. So CNH whether they will be in digital format. I think it is going to be something happening for sure. Digital Hong Kong do for sure whether it's offshore CNH, not sure and whether it's done by Hong Kong companies or chinese companies. But we all know that once there's a stable coin in place and the government actually has been trying out over the past several years, whether it's with the Thailand Hong Kong may equivalent on testing out the settlement with digital stablecoin or stablecoin is to connect the greater Bay area. Because Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. If imagine at one world that stablecoin being regulated and being endorsed by the government, our stocks could essentially be settled instantly by having digital Hong Kong did directly buying a stock exchange. So that's something connect the whole region and creating another powerful economic zone. But one way that I see it is and it's also not something that I think regulator will do, but something I hope regulator will do is after having the digital Hong Kong D in place and how it should be regulated, but then also to the enterprise stable coins. So meaning that if new world as a listed company, a pretty big property developer in Hong Kong can launch a digital new world stablecoin actually it will totally transform the equity market and I see actually happening. I heard conversation around that already within the government, but not sure when that will be launched. Probably Angelina will know better than I do. Besides all the stablecoin stuff, I think derivative market is something going to be regulated pretty soon and good and bad as well. It is much bigger than the spot market. So I think if it got regulated in a pre clear way, same as the spot market now huge opportunities to Hong Kong as well."

So that one step is one step further. The E Hong Kong dollar. The HKMA has announced a competition or a group of people have been selected to come up with use cases for the e Hong Kong dollar and how it will be used in terms of Hong Kong. So there have been some very novel cases that are being worked on right now for final presentation to work with HKMA as well as Liscos and companies in Hong Kong to start launching use cases. So you can see that the government is really actually finding use cases for the e Hong Kong dollar. And echoing what Adrian is saying, the cooperation between UAE, Thailand, Hong Kong is really working together as they study how to come up with a stablecoin that works amongst all these different parties. So that's continuing. And then you asked about other products that are probably going to be launched. The SFC has already committed to issuing a paper at some point about tokenization, which is very clear rules, and this has really been lacking, which is why tokenization has not taken off as fast as it should be taking off. So they've committed to saying that they will issue a consultation paper on tokenization. They just need a bit of time. So that's one area that's going to be looked at."

But I can definitely say that real estate is very hot and in an area that people are very, very interested in seeing some kind of consultation on. So I think that's going to be coming out. NFTs, the SFC has said that they are not going to regulate it at this time, but their view may be changing because of the use. Cases of NFTs are also changing. The original art based NFT wasn't really that interesting in terms of as a product. But as the use of NFTs grows, that could be another area where the SFC will issue additional guidance in terms of products. So I think all of this development is going to be interesting. But as Adrian said, I think the most exciting will be how the Chinese, the Yi Yuan, 22,000 companies worked on developing this whole system in China, for the Yi Yuan. So if 22,000 companies in China are working on that, you can imagine how important it is to China. And then for Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar will be very important because, of course, our neighbors China, and if we're one country, two systems so I think that will grow in time, especially with trading and its trading partners with Hong Kong and China. The e dollars will definitely be an important part of growth for all economies around the world."

The low key support shows that officials are keen on using the laissez faire city as a testing ground for digital assets as they keep a tight rein on any such activity on the mainland.

I think both of you have read the news. People got arrested in China for doing something in crypto as exactly. We see tons of chinese companies, not just in financial companies. Actually, I think the government is also talking to chinese gaming companies. If you want to set up crypto fund or crypto arm, just do it in Hong Kong. It's a very clear direction that Hong Kong now is the city for you to. And that's exactly if you translate that across the supply chain. I think most of the not just custodian exchanges, but also projects now are moving to Hong Kong. Cyberport has. I was talking to the Cyberpunk vetting committee. Saport is kind of, I'm not sure what it's nonprofit, but they're basically the incubation center endorsed by the government. Government owned as well. To encourage entrepreneurship. They have received, overdose 200 of companies from China just to enter incubation program. Historically, if you want to get incubation program, you are a startup that is probably need monies. But they receive a lot of proposals from chinese companies which are super rich. They just want to be in Hong Kong because they want to be in crypto.

So, again, in, in the case of Hong Kong, because I think the Hong Kong government did push very hard to be able to have technology as well as digital assets as well as web three, moving forward. As a technological advancer for China, I think this is proof that the system is working, and that's how China makes sure that these test labs work before other things are allowed to move forward.

So you're seeing that happen in China, and there is uptake as the blockchain technology evolves, not just in digital assets, but also in use cases for payments, in use cases for parts and tracking of parts, for example, tracking of livestock. It's amazing some of the things that the blockchain can do to keep track of livestock and car manufacturing. I've seen the most amazing prototypes of tracking devices that actually watch how livestock is growing, how fast it weighs them automatically and monitors their systems, for example, their life systems. So you're seeing use cases that are moving from what was imagined into real areas. And this is where China is excelling because they've got so much thought power in the blockchain to push this forward.

So I feel like when we talk about blockchain application as well in China, CBDC obviously is one huge use cases that I heard a lot happening around two things. One is NFT equivalent. They call it digital collectible in China. So you can use the word nft in China. You have to use digital collectible. Well, is the fundamental difference is probably NFT could be mined on public blockchain, but digital collectibles have to be means on private blockchain endorsed by China or part of China ecosystem. And the second thing is actually metaverse. So metaverse is a huge problem in China. The difference between the usual metaverse and these metaverse in China is they are promoting digital properties and digital properties could be XR, Al VR, could be holograph. It doesn't necessarily relate to crypto, but the idea of open world and metaverse actually has already reflected in the gaming world, reflected into hosting concert in a metaphor setting, an open world digital format setting. So I think China is pushing, I would put it this way, I think they are pushing the fees behind web three, not necessarily the public blockchain, but they believe that some of the services should be accessible easily at a cheaper cost, but could be on the private blockchain. Well, ironically, even as a vc ourselves, I don't necessarily think it's wrong because when you have a mass of 1.2 billion people, it's different from launching a private blockchain among 8 million people. So I think China is pushing that front and using Hong Kong as the city to test really front. At some point it will integrate.

And you can buy, if you're a Hong Kong person, you can buy directly stock from Shanghai and other exchanges directly. So that's an example where China has connected, and using Charles Lee's description, where Hong Kong ex is connecting China to the world and the world to China, because you can trade directly. So China is already moving into this space in terms of testing in possibilities for close circuit. But you can invest into China directly as well as chinese investors can directly invest into Hong Kong. And I think in time, as China gets more comfortable, they're probably going to enlarge that stock, connect to other markets. And certainly, I think because HKEx owns London Metals Exchange and had aspirations to move into the London stock Exchange at some point point before, there will be opportunities for China to connect more outwards also. But they're already doing it in terms of owning international companies, but it's just been limited in terms of how open that common person in Beijing can access the foreign markets. So I think it's going to be a little bit slow. But the world is opening, and Hong Kong truly is a conduit for China and opening it up to the world. So that's just my view."

What's been happening is as well, it was a prediction that I made that within five to ten years, within five years from 2018, that almost all the regulators around the world would start doing some kind of regulation. And sure enough, you're seeing that exact thing happened. So, in particular, Dubai has moved forward with an innovative regulator called Vara, virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. And we met with them. When we went to. I went with a group recently to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. So Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular have regimes and have licensed digital asset firms, binance being one of the main ones, at the Abu Dhabi financial Center. And Dubai already has issued, in principle, approvals for licensees. And a lot of people find moving to Dubai interesting. And it has been attracting financial players. So the Middle east is an area that has become very interesting because, of course, the Emirati money, as well as the investments that Riyadh, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are making to attract investors have really brought in a lot of people relocating there. Then you've got Europe, which just put in Mika and Mika. There's still a lot to be studied. And in fact, Iosco will be meeting next week in Thailand. So I'm sure the digital asset agenda, it will be discussed amongst all the global regulators. But you're seeing Europe now has a regime that's starting to come together, but it's too early to tell how that will attract or not attract people. Asia still seems to be the hot area. Then you're looking at the US. I understand that our republican government has actually issued some sort of draft legislation and has put it out there in the United States for regulation of digital assets, but there hasn't been much coverage. But it was mentioned in the news that a draft has been published. You're looking at South America. Some countries have actually started issuing legislation, but it's very sparse. So you've got El Salvador, for example, that does embrace bitcoin. Africa, the last frontier, is also looking at putting in regulations. There are firms that are pushing the frontier there to get regulated and start operations in the african countries, but no regulator has really taken a firm push, except for possibly Nigeria and Uganda. So there is definite interest in Africa as the next frontier of growth. So that's sort of a whistle stop of some of the countries that are looking at it. But I think aside from Asia, I think the Middle east is probably the second most interesting place to be. I don't know if you agree with that, Adrian."

        "text": "Well, I have. From a firm perspective, we look into moving headquarters, obviously, same as a lot of different companies over the past two years. And we decided to base in Hong Kong. And I think it is a key set. There are several key factors, but the key thing is globally, they're just free cities with a huge enough financial market to support global activities. It's New York, London and Hong Kong, just three of them. And London been doing quite a lot. FCA has been doing quite a lot of sandbox and all that. You don't see a lot happening actually. New York, obviously, with all these things happening now, is going nowhere relatively to Hong Kong. So it is. I think the view that we have formulated as a company is if you want to grow truly into a web free hub, maybe licensing and the capital formation is quite important at the beginning, and it comes down to whether you could attract not just funding, but also developers and builders into the city. So Hong Kong has been quite weak, to be honest, in terms of developers and builders, but we have set the stone in terms of capital fundraising and so it should be easier to attract talent in. But I agree with Angelina when I look at different jurisdictions because I personally, I got a license approval, I think back in 2019 in Abu Dhabi. So when my previous startup liquid, we got a principle and approval and for being OTC player custodizing asset, and you could uplift the license for trading. So it's quite early stage for ADGM to do that. My first experience with middle is you have much less other geopolitical concerns when it comes to crypto, obviously Hong Kong. The reason we discuss a lot about China and Hong Kong is because there are multiple factors influencing people, people perceptions on Hong Kong. But Middle east usually is pure business. So you don't really hear about whether Middle east is particularly related to China or Hong Kong when it comes to China and us, when it comes to crypto, you just hear about where you should raise, whether Dubai, Abu Dhabi, any kind of part of the UAE. So my view is, I think most of the builders or decentralized finance projects, they likely will move towards the Middle east. And for now, the centralized companies, exchanges, brokers, investment banks which specialize in crypto likely will be in Hong Kong. And I am very pessimistic for Singapore because from a primary, primary perspective myself, I deal with several communities, whether it's Token 29 as a conference, has thought about Hong Kong as a place inside Singapore just because they signed a contract with Singapore. That's sort of why they have to be there. Just this year. Some of the, even for NFT ape fest, for broad ape actually thinking between Singapore and Hong Kong. So there's not gonna be two cities as referee hub in Asia, it's gonna just one. So if it's just be one, Hong Kong is a ten times bigger financial hub than Singapore. People always forgot about about Singapore is just a tiny country. So think about if I think about that for a future three or five years as a firm, you do have presence in Hong Kong, Middle east, whether you have to be in Europe, I think I agree with Angelina. Mika is quite early developed, but very positive. But Europe to me fundamentally is quite passive in tourists pushing crypto, not from a regulatory point of view, but commercial point of view. Us, to be honest, I don't know. I don't advise portfolios to now put much resources there for now."

Yeah, for that. All right, you guys, this has been such a fascinating discussion. Where can people learn more about each of you?"

Adrian, I would probably say you also love Hong Kong and I love Hong Kong and this has been my home and I really hope it will succeed as a crypto financial center, not only being a massive international financial center. So I'm committed to it and hope you'll come out here and visit us."

        "text": "Well, LinkedIn, Twitter, I'm quite active in Twitter, but even though I talk a lot about different stuff as well on Twitter, and we will be, my firm will be co hosting Ethereum Hong Kong in October. We announced already as on the 13 June. And so I would love to invite both of you to. Yeah, sure. Because the main reason for me is to do it as a firm is because we want to do something developer driven. So not necessarily just a financial market or licensed product driven, but more attracting builders and developers. I think most of the people remember Hong Kong as an international financial center, but didn't remember Hong Kong actually grow as an entrepreneur. Enterport is not necessarily related to finance, but the way to connect the east and west is actually Hong Kong's natural advantage. Physically, geographically, we are at a very good position to be the place and being an entrepreneur, meaning we also have to attract talent, capital and efforts back to the city. And as a boy born and raised in Hong Kong, I am very passionate to make that happen alongside Angelina and everyone in Hong Kong."
