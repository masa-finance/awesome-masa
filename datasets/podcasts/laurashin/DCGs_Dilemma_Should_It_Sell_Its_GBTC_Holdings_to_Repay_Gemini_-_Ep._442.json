        "text": "There's been quite the ongoing feud between Gemini and crypto lender Genesis, as well as its parent company, DCG. Just to give some background for people who haven't been following this, although we have covered it on the show, Gemini has a program called Earn that has been offering yield to its customers, and in order to earn that return, it's been lending those assets to Genesis. But because of the numerous bankruptcies that are happening, Genesis is having at minimum liquidity issues and quite possibly unlikely insolvency issues, so it cannot pay back Gemini earned customers. Last week, Cameron Winklevoss sent a public letter to Barry Silbert, the head of DCG, giving him a deadline of January 8, which was Sunday, to publicly commit to working together to solve this problem. The deadline came and went, and Cameron just sent another letter. So, Kareem, can you tell us what it is that he said and why this letter was significant?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. It's very interesting because this letter, unlike the first, is very pointed. It's some big allegations in there. In terms of what's been going on at DCG and Genesis. And one thing that's very interesting in particular is I think within the first line of the letter, he almost directly states fraud as being kind of the root cause of all this. From my perspective. I try not to think about it from that standpoint and rather look at what has gone wrong and what are the issues that Genesis and DCG currently face. And I think the reality is that the legal process will ensue, and ultimately that's where we'll get more clarity. But without a doubt, what's been put forth to the DCG board is pretty pointed. And what I found more interesting is Barry's response."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, and before we get to Barry's response, I just wanted to clarify, when you said that the legal process is going to bring more clarity, what kind of legal process are you referring to?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, it's clear that at this point there is, you know, lawsuits ongoing, and there's a lot of concerns overdose what's gone on at DCG and Genesis. And I think the reality is that this is only going to get more and more focus over the next few weeks and few months as the resolution to what's going to happen to Genesis creditors doesn't get resolved. And I think this really only puts DCG and Genesis in a tougher position to try to figure out their situation sooner than later, then ultimately becomes a massive burden for all of the customers of Gemini, but all dollar creditors in Genesis as well."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "All right, so let's now then talk about Barry Silbert's response. What did you find so remarkable about it?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, there's a few things, and I think the reality is that not many people have actually seen the financials behind ECG or genesis for that matter. So any snippet that we get is really revealing. And I think one thing that I found particularly interesting is, as you scroll down through that note that he kind of sent to his board of directors, there's an FAQ section. That FAQ section outlines a few numbers that I found really interesting. One that we already knew about, obviously, was the $1.1 billion promissory note that DCG wrote to Genesis with a ten year maturity, which was meant to effectively take on the three AC liability that Genesis has. One thing that's very important to note about that is that this is a ten year asset at this point for genesis, so it's not a current asset. And another thing that we knew prior is that DCG has a $500 million loan from Genesis that is actually due in May in 2023, which I think a lot of analysts or people following this are keeping a close eye on, because I think the reality is that that means I some sort of liquidity situation is going to need to resolve itself by then, unless Genesis or DCG tries to find another way around this."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "All right, so earlier when I asked you about what you meant by legal process, you surprisingly didn't mention that you expected that Genesis would file for chapter eleven bankruptcy. But that has been talked about a lot. So why is it that you didn't mention that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It's interesting because I think the reality is, in your in a situation where DCG has some levers to pull here, but the reality might be that those levers are kind of diminishing as time goes by. And so while it is a possibility that Genesis kind of gets forced into chapter eleven in some way or another, it's hard to really say what the ultimate way out is here. But it's clear that DCG's choices are really shrinking pretty quickly."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "One other thing that I wanted to mention about that FAQ section in the DCG shareholder letter was that Silbert also said that the $1.1 billion loan is not callable."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Correct."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Which is what a number of people had been concerned about, and suggesting that if that were the case, then Genesis going under or filing for chapter eleven would also cause DCG too, as well. So what did that say to you? Because I think a lot of people thought that it was. What does that mean to you about how it might be structured?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Realizing that it's not callable ultimately means that it doesn't fix the liquidity issue at Genesis. The reality is that this is a promissory note. Somebody showed me a meme yesterday which kind of showed a paper napkin saying an IOU of 1.1 billion, which I thought was amusing. But I think the reality is that when you realize that Genesis has $3 billion in creditors, and those creditors are all short term creditors who effectively are asking for their money back, then the reality is that that asset of 1.1 billion, which is a ten year asset at the end of the day for Genesis, can't really be monetized unless DCG puts up the capital. And the fact that there's no call option in there guarantees you the fact that this is a long duration asset and nothing less."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. Yeah. And just to make clear for people, the amount that the Gemini earn customers is, are owed. Is $900 million. So that would obviously be an amount of money that would cover that. So one other thing that I wanted to ask about was Cameron Winklevoss laid out a number of allegations that he was calling accounting fraud. And I wondered how credible you thought the claims in his letter were."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, I think the reality is that if anything is actually, if anything that's longer than a year is actually listed as current on the balance sheet, then that is problematic. Without a question. I'm not an accountant, so I don't really want to comment on what the legal consequences of that would be. However, what I will say is that as a risk manager and somebody who's kind of worked in fixing them for a long time, asset liability matching is a big thing, and that has big implications from that regard. And it's pretty clear at this point that hole cannot currently be filled because that promissory note is a ten year promissory note, and nothing then, not anything shorter than that. If I can add to that, I think it's worth noting that we know that DCG has been trying to sell off some of their assets. And I think it's worth thinking about how. What does that really mean? Part of that could really mean that they're conscious that they might have to plug a hole and they might need to make that payback, that 1.1 billion sooner than later, or actually monetize, for example, that loss from three ac. Right. By covering it up with other assets and liquidity. Now, I think the reality is that we're going to be in a position where DCG and genesis are going to have to empty their pockets and see what really makes sense in terms of plugging that hole. But being in this situation as it is right now, with creditors sitting and waiting, is not very sustainable. And the longer this goes on, it's going to become worse."

Laura, link in the description back to my conversation with Kareem. So another thing which you kind of alluded to, but I want to unpack it a little bit more. Is this terminology of current? Because both Cameron and Barry Silbert have been using it and I potentially different ways. I'm just going to quote from the letter that Cameron Winklevoss sent. He says, first, as a matter of generally accepted accounting principles and common understanding, a current asset refers to cash, cash equivalents, or other assets that can be exchanged into cash within one year. A promissory note with a principal repayment due in ten years falls outside the definition of a current asset by a country mile. Now, you might have seen also that after, you know, we saw then that Silbert responded with the letter which said that the promissory note was not callable. Ryan Selkis of Masari posited a theory that Silbert might be using a different definition of current and said that you can use the word current also to say, like, this borrower is meeting all payments on its loans, although as Ram Alawali pointed out, in this case, there's only one payment, which will be the one in 2032. So do you think that that's what's going on here? And if so, is that kind of the obfuscation that Cameron Reynkovas is talking about?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I agree with Cameron in regards to how an accounting practices current means something that's within a year. I. From, you know, I've reread the tweets that Barry has put out, and at least the way I interpret it, I do think that what he's trying to state is that DCG is current, which basically means he's, the loan is performing. But I mean, I think it's pretty clear that this has, you know, various interpretations. And I don't think Rahm is necessarily wrong. I just think here just a matter of how you interpret what's being said. But the way I looked at it is, you know, all he was trying to really communicate was that DCG is not currently late on any payments due to Genesis, and basically said that DCG currently is fine."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Oh, okay. So he's not saying that that should be counted as a current asset on Genesis's books."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I would not. I would not interpret it that way, at least. At least the way I kind of look at it. But I think the reality is that anything on Twitter can be kind of misconstrued in different ways. But I would imagine that Barry's also advised not to put out something that would be misleading. And I think that would definitely be misleading because there's nothing about a ten year promissory note that makes it current."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. Okay. So it seems like he's using a different definition."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think we're nitpicking here, to be honest, and that's really it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "But, I mean, don't you think that that's exactly what's going on behind the scenes before they post all of these, that the lawyers are combing over everything and, I mean, I feel like parsing the language is probably useful."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No, I think you're absolutely right. It's hard to really gauge some of the motivations and how people are thinking about it. I'm just kind of giving kind of the way I would look at it as somebody who's kind of worked in loans before, using the terminology current on loans is fairly common in terms of interpreting that the loan has no late payments and the borrower is currently not in default, for example."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Right, right. But you also agreed about Cameron's definition of current asset. So that then supports Ryan's theory, Ryan Selkus theory, that they're using this current in two different ways. Okay, so at this point, what questions do you have for DCG or Barry Silbert or Genesis? Like, what do you think people don't yet know that would help determine either where to lay the blame, or how this situation could potentially be resolved? Or how it might eventually be resolved?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Of course, I'd like to see. I'd like to ask DCG for some sort of plan between the two entities, DCG and genesis, as to how they look to fill these liquidity gaps. Because the reality is that we have an idea of what the assets are. We know what the liabilities are. We also know that those liabilities are going out the door. So the question is that your asset base, how do you monetize it? How do you monetize it so that you can pay back your creditors, or at least come to the agreement, your creditors. And I think that's something that's really important. And it's important to bear in mind that these are intercompany loans. So the reality is, when we're talking about Genesis, we kind of end up talking about DCG, because this promissory note, you know, I think, you know, while it does, it serves a purpose. The reality is, is that in a situation, you know, what's materialized over the last few months that no longer cuts it. Right. It was meant to kind of COVID a hole and over the long run, be repaid. But under circumstance in which you have liabilities going out the door, you have to be in a situation where you can monetize your assets so that you can cover those liabilities."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "All right, well, who knows how all of that will play out? But another wild colored here is that Bloomberg reported that federal prosecutors in the eastern District of New York, as well as the securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating the transfers between DCG and a subsidiary. That people are positing is probably genesis and also looking into what it is that investors were told about those transactions. DCG says they don't know anything about this, but I was wondering what you think investigators would be looking for if that is the case."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think the goal here would probably be to understand to what degree the arm's length. Arm's length, I say, is that the nature of the promissory note was really conducted in. Right. To what extent was Barry, for example, directly involved in constructing that loan, that promissory note to Genesis? Because I think ultimately that becomes a potential issue. It's also important to kind of note that when you kind of zoom out a little bit, this starts to look pretty ugly. Right? We're talking grayscale, another subsidiary of DCG, who obviously has GBTC, which is kind of their big product and one of the most important revenue lines for DCG and its subsidiaries. One has garnered tons of attention. Three, AC was involved, ultimately got liquidated. DCG has now a relatively large stake, or 11% stake in GBTC. And it's kind of worth noting that this is their most valuable asset as a, you know, empire, if you want to call it that. So I think the reality is that you're in a position where the intercompany kind of relationships start to look fairly shady. And I think it's pretty standard for regulators to look into this stuff. It's worth noting that kind of, when you look at traditional finance, there is tends, there needs to be kind of an arm's length nature in the way that companies deal with themselves, even between subsidiaries. And that that's going to be. That's going to be a sticking point here. And I think that's actually a lesson that we're probably. We can take away from in 2022."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And what kinds of terms on that promissory note would kind of meet the standard of arm's length and what kind of terms and conditions would not?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Sure. I mean, the one that really sticks out to me is the interest rate on the loan. The interest rate was deemed 1%. Now, if I were to just look at DCG as a venture capital firm that has kind of exposure everywhere, quite a bit of concentration in terms of Earth's exposures, especially into crypto. Right. And then look at, for example, other crypto firms that do have bonds outstanding. One thing is clear is that 1% is not really the appropriate rate to quantify that the credit risk behind ECG, especially ten years out. So that's something that I would look into to kind of question, because I have a hard time believing that 1% was really the right place to price this. But then again, from a legal perspective, I'm not sure exactly what those rules would be in terms of what defines arms length or not."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So, as you alluded earlier, Genesis owes creditors more than $3 billion, and DCG is exploring selling some assets from its venture portfolio to raise money. Do you think that strategy could be successful and get them out of this pickle in time?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yes, I do think that it is a potential solution. I want to caveat that. Right. I think it's worth noting that a lot of their assets are venture capital investments, which at some point are marked at a certain valuation. But it's very possible, and in fact, probably likely that those valuations are not mark to market currently. And it's also worth noting that typically a market, when they know a participant's in trouble and has to sell the markets are going to be very kind in terms of giving you the valuations you're looking for. So I think the fear, and this is something you might have brought up at the very beginning of this conversation, is that liquidity issue, but could very well end up being a bigger issue, solvency issue at that."

So I would imagine that if they're going to get it done, it needs to be sooner than later. And to be frank with you, I would have liked to have seen this in December. I have an idea in my head as to how this gets resolved for DCG and Genesis. But you know what? I think the truth is that that's something that barrier, DCG doesn't necessarily want to go on with or doesn't necessarily want to admit the situation they're currently in the, which I think ultimately only risks harming them over the next few months."
    },

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yes, partially selling the venture investments. I mean, it's worth noting that obviously they own 11% of GBTC. GBTC trades at a 40% discount. In my mind, this whole thing has amounted to one very big GBTC discount trade, which ultimately has ended up back in the hands of the parent of the issuer of GBTC. Which I think if I were to kind of interpret it my own way, I would look at it as he's made a levered bet on his own product getting converted to an ETF. And it's unfortunate where we are right now, but it just doesn't look very."

And I think at that point its probably in the best interest of the shareholders to ultimately have a management company who's considered healthy and can take on the responsibility of managing GBDC. But I mean, the reality is that it's kind of unclear how this plays out from here. It's also unclear cause, you know, we know that the SEC is looking into DCG in Genesis, but we don't have further details to that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. Yeah. One other thing that doesn't look very good is that two board members who are quite prominent, Glenn Hutchinson, Larry Summers, left, and that was actually back in November. So again, not really promising developments for DCG. I guess the only other thing that I'd like to ask you about is that there was another company, Bitvavo, that revealed that DCG had offered to pay it at least 70% of the $300 million that it gave, that it loaned to Genesis. But Bitvavo refused that offer, saying that Genesis does have the ability to repay the total amount within the agreed upon period. So what do you think of that development?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think it's interesting. I think the reality is DCG might be trying to work with creditors who could be willing to work with them and accept some sort of discount to the overall borrowings. I think the reality is that it's not really panning out properly. And what Bivo is probably trying to state here is that there's assets there. You just need to do what you need to do to make them liquid to pay us back in full. And I think that's really the sticking point. And the fact that bivouac has rejected that kind of means, I think broadly means that creditors are not going to really be budging at this point, because I think most who followed the crypto space pretty closely, it's hard to ignore how messy this situation has gotten. And I think ultimately a lot of this ends up falling on DCG, which is really unfortunate."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So just to draw out something that you said earlier, it seems like your basic recommendation to DCG would be what? To sell the 11% of GPTC that they own in order to recoup whatever they could from that and sell some venture investments and then use all that to pay anyway. You fill it in. I'm not going to, of course."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No, I mean, the problem is that there's no good recommendation because the reality is that had you risk managed yourself properly, you would have never put yourself in this situation. And that's the really tough part. Now, if you want to tell me how, if you want to ask me how do you get this resolved quickly? Yes, you gotta sell what you can sell, which I would suggest is probably some of your more valuable assets that, if anything, bury, probably treasures, but then if anything as well. The way I kind of looked at it in the math that I kind of did in November, suggested that if there were redemption mechanism that were enabled for GBTC, then you would see a large increase in the asset value of their GBTC holdings, which are obviously 11% of all GPTC outstanding, which would fill a big chunk of that hole. Now, it's worth noting, you know, DCG grayscale make a lot of money off those fees, which I believe are currently at 2%. And that is kind of the prized possession for the DCG empire. And so giving that up is tough. And I think that's really a situation I've kind of taken the stance, and I've spoken to Rahm about this over the last few months, and I've spoken to plenty of people about this, is that. That the best solution here is probably to end this GBTC trade by ultimately allowing redemptions to happen and kind of get this saga over with. Because we know that this has been going on for the last call year. And, you know, three AC was involved, we know all our hedge funds were involved, we know Genesis got tied up. I think the reality is that this saga just needs to end."

        "text": "Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in crypto after this short break. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap SEC charges Genesis and Gemini with offering unregistered securities after wrapping the interview with Kareem, news broke that the SEC charged both Genesis and Gemini with offering unregistered securities to Gemini earn customers. The complaint alleges that the depositors in the Gemini earn program lent their crypto to Genesis, while Gemini acted as an agent, facilitating the transaction and taking a fee as high as 4.29% from the returns that Genesis paid out. Meanwhile, the SEC says Genesis used its discretion to generate interest for Gemini earned customers. In the complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, prejudgment, interest and civil penalties against both Genesis and Gemini. SBF launches a sub stack while under house arrest Sam Bankman Fried, the disgraced founder of Crypto exchange FTX, published a blog post on his new substac newsletter titled FTX pre mortem overview, in which he gave his perspective on the collapse of the company and sister trading firm Alameda Research. He named three reasons for the collapse of FTX the huge amount of illiquid assets on Alameda's balance sheet Alameda's failure to hedge against the bear market, also known as poor risk management and Alameda's targeted crash precipitated by the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ. As for how all these issues at Alameda caused FTX to go insolvent, he blamed contagion similarly to how three arrows, etcetera ultimately impacted Voyager, Genesis, Celsius, Blockfi, Gemini and others. Keeping in line with his recent plea in court, SPF maintained his innocence. He said, I didn't steal funds and I certainly didn't stash billions away. He also called it ridiculous that FTX us users haven't recovered their funds yet, since, as he claims, the american subsidiary was fully solvent when he left the company. FTX recovers $5 billion in assets in a court hearing on Wednesday, the liquidators of FTX said they have been able to recover a substantial amount of assets, including cash, liquid cryptocurrencies and liquid investment securities worth over $5 billion. They added that this sum does not include an additional $425 million worth of crypto held by the Bahamas Securities Commission. Despite this significant recovery, there is still an undisclosed amount of missing assets that are owed to customers. Moreover, this week the United States Department of Justice took possession of over $456 million worth of Robinhood shares that were owned by Sam Bankman Fried and Gary Wong, the co founders of FTX. The shares were confiscated because they are considered assets connected to illegal activities such as money laundering or violations of wire fraud. In the ongoing bankruptcy case, Judge John Dorsey rejected a request from media organizations and the us government to disclose the list of creditors for FTX, which will remain sealed for another three months. Still, bankruptcy court documents revealed that Tom Brady, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's companies, and crypto firms like BlackRock, Coinbase, Lightspeed, Pantera, and the Tezos foundation are among the stockholders of FTX.

For example, Future Fund, FTX's charitable arm, had pledged more than $160 million to over 110 nonprofits.

Us bankruptcy judge Michael Wiles in New York gave Voyager permission to enter into an asset purchase agreement with the crypto exchange and to hold a vote amongst its creditors on the sale, as per the court filing. If executed, Voyager customers who have been unable to access their funds since July 2022 will get 51% of their capital back. Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July due to the crypto winter and exposure to the now collapsed Terra and three arrows capital.

Layoffs again hit the industry. Coinbase, the largest exchange in the US, announced in a blog post that it will be cutting about 25% of its operating expenses, which includes layoffs of about 950 employees, roughly 20% of its workforce.

The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, stated that the company is well capitalized and that the changes will ultimately benefit Coinbase in the long run. Coinbase is downsizing its workforce for the second time in less than a year, following the layoffs of 1100 people in June 2022. Consensys, one of the biggest players in the ethereum ecosystem and the developer of a popular web three wallet metamask, followed Coinbase's path and announced it was firing 100 employees.

BlockFi executives did not withdraw any crypto after October bankrupt crypto lender Blockfi has assured a court that its executives did not withdraw any of their own crypto held on the platform prior to filing for bankruptcy. Lawyers representing BlockFi told the court that this is not a case of insider extraction of value, as seen in Celsius, where management withdrew large amounts of money on the eve of filing for bankruptcy. Joshua Sussberg, a partner at law firm Kirkland and Ellis, which represents both Blockfi and Celsius in their bankruptcy proceedings, noted that $15 million worth of withdrawals made in August by five senior executives at Blockfi were used to settle litigation.

This manipulation of metrics helped boost the growth of their Solana based stablecoin project. In the midst of the 2021 crypto market peak, DoJ is now looking into the web of crypto projects associated with Sabre, including the Defi app Sunny aggregator and the stablecoin project cashio. The investigation remains ongoing, but Sabre Labs continues to operate. Meanwhile, the sunny and cashio projects have been shuttered. El Salvador passes bill to pave the way for issuance of bitcoin bonds El Salvador's legislative body has taken a crucial step forward in the issuance of the country's bitcoin bonds that were supposed to launch early last year and passed a bill that will establish a legal framework for all digital assets that are not bitcoin and will open doors for President Naib Bukele's bitcoin bonds. The plan entails issuing $1 billion in bonds on Blockstream's liquid network and investing half of the funds in bitcoin and the other half in the infrastructure necessary to develop the bitcoin industry in El Salvador. The bonds would also offer a 6.5% yield and provide a quick path for investors to acquire citizenship in the country.
