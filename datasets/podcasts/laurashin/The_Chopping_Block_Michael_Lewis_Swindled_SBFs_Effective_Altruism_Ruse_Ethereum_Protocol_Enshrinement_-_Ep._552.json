He always saw crypto as instrumental. And that I think everybody who's ever met Sam agrees with is that Sam was not a true believer. He didn't really care that much about the industry. He saw it as an opportunity to make money. But it wasn't because he just, you know, he loves to cars or private jets or whatever."

Okay, so just for context for everybody listening, we are recording this on Monday morning us time the news. By the time this drops, I'm certain is going to be 100% about the FTX sand Bangkin free trial. So I believe the trial starts on Tuesday.

But in the lead up to the trial, all eyes have been on Michael Lewis. So Michael Lewis, very famous finance writer. He was the author of the Flash boys book, if I'm not mistaken. Yes. And so he, long story short, he was kind of embedded with Sam Bankman, fried for something about a year and a half since 2021 before FTX collapsed. Basically more or less lived with him in the Bahamas and was writing a book, didn't know what the book was going to be about. And he's dropping the book tomorrow. So the day the trial begins, Michael Lewis's book is going to drop. It's called. What is it called? Finding infinity or something. I don't know, something like that. And he appeared on 60 Minutes to give something of a preview of what the book is going to be about and his perspective on Sam banking freed. And this interview has got the entire Internet in a tizzy. I watched the entire interview. The first thing I'll say about 60 minutes is it's really weird that 60 minutes is not 60 minutes long.

So there were, there were a few snippets from the 60 Minutes story that got the Internet really excited. One of them was this anecdote that apparently near the end of the FTX before, right before FTX collapsed, Sam Bankman Fried, in part of his effective altruistic mindset and thinking about ways to ameliorate risk in the world, he believed that one of the biggest risks in the world was Donald Trump. And he knew that Donald Trump was going to be running in the next election, and so he contemplated paying Trump not to run in the. In the upcoming election. Uh, and so apparently, word of this got to Trump. Trump named a price, which was $5 billion. And SBF. At the time that FTX collapsed, apparently, SBF was trying to figure out the legality of paying Trump not to run in the 2024 election. But then FTX collapsed, and this never happened. Kind of insane story. I don't know what you guys think of this. Obviously, there's no way he had the liquidity to be able to pay $5 billion in cash to Donald Trump.

When these multibillion dollar opportunities came up, I assume they looked at the metaphorical piggy bank, saw that there was high single digit, low double digit billions of dollars available, and thought, well, what are the craziest things possible with this?

You might win, you might lose. You don't really know what the outcome is going to be. If somebody says, pay me $5 billion, and I will definitely not run. That is such a different deal than funding a political candidate and having some probability of winning. There's a lot of study in political science of the effectiveness of money in politics. And the trope is that, oh, money is kind of. So you could buy anything in politics. Like, you just spent enough money. And the overwhelming consensus within this body of research, that is just not true. Right? Like, the efficacy of using money to buy politicians or to win races is actually quite low. And you can see this, actually, from all the candidates that SPF backed. SBF threw lots and lots of money into a lot of these, like, small congressional races, thinking that, okay, they were sort of uncontested. They had these EA aligned candidates who they sort of hand picked to run in these less competitive states. And I think almost every single one of them lost despite the fact that they outspent their opponents by a large margin. Same thing with, like, Michael Bloomberg, right? Michael Bloomberg's outspent. Almost every single democratic candidate got almost no votes. And so there's a large body of research that basically says it's surprisingly hard to turn money into political outcomes in the US. It's less true in other countries. But if somebody said, like, look, pay me $5 billion, and, like, another candidate besides Trump will win, I think very quickly the money would get raised for that. You could probably just get a room of ten people together who are sufficiently rich, and they'd be like, yeah, fuck Trump. I will throw in a billion of my 50 billion to just avoid the next four years sucking."

But right now, absurdly rich people who would be able to raise $5 billion have the ability to donate $5 billion to a super PAC, which spends that much money to influence the outcome of the election.

I think, actually, there's some studies that suggest the causality is reversed, where it's like, the most popular candidates are therefore able to raise the most money, instead of the other way around. If everyone knew that you spend this amount of money you get this sort of guaranteed outcome.

I mean, the problem, again, with Trump, though, is that I think a large part of the reason why he wants the presidency is not for money. Obviously he wants money, but I think a lot of it is really just all the criminal cases against him that he wants to. He can fend them off much more readily if he's president again, so that he doesn't get for $5 billion. So another story that Michael Lewis detailed in his book. So, again, we don't have the book yet. It comes out tomorrow. But I heard him on another podcast where he talked about when everything was collapsing. So when the quote, unquote, bank run started. One thing I take a lot of issue with, the way that Michael Lewis is talking about SBF. You can tell he's very sympathetic to Sam. So he keeps talking about it as a bank run, which, like, it was not a fucking bank run. It was a bank run in the sense that people were trying to get out. But exchange is never supposed to have a bank run. Exchange is supposed to be fully collateralized. So bank runs only exist for under collateralized systems, which he somehow never quite gets that in his explanations of what happened with FTX. But anyway, when everything was collapsing, supposedly all of the lieutenants, like Nishad, Gary, Caroline, apparently everyone left to go to their parents houses, which I thought was very weird, where he was like, he was like, yeah, you know, this multibillion dollar company was collapsing. And instead of, like, going in and going through the books and trying to figure everything out, instead everyone went to their parents. And it's like, okay. There was never a clear moment when I realized this company was run by 20 somethings, because that was their immediate instinct is go hang out with your mom and try to get her to explain to the cops what's happening. So any reactions to that?"

So I actually talked to Michael Lewis about, well, for the book after, like, this year, and I got the vibe that it's just like, he already wrote the book and he's not going to change most of it, and, like, he's going to add a section at the end, you know, maybe Samson's to collapse. I don't know. That was like, the vibe I got was that there's like, he's not really changing the book until the end. And, like, my argument is that that strategy probably dictated the media strategy, which is why we got the outcome that we saw. It isn't necessarily an indicator of truth. It's more likely an indicator of a media strategy. So keep that. That's just my. Maybe somewhat."

So if you just write a book that says he was a bad guy, he was lying the whole time. It's all genuine. He's. He's a chaucerian fraud. Everything was, you know, all set up in order to steal money. That's not an interesting book. You know, that's just like a, you know, detail of a serial murder or something. It's an interesting book if there's a conflict at the center of it about, you know, the genuine tear of wanting to improve the world versus this utilitarian kind of calculus that was, you know, that ran too close to the cliff edge. I believe that he believes it. You can tell from his interactions with the way he talks about SPF that he was genuinely dazzled by him and he genuinely thought he was a really smart guy. And I think everybody who knew Sam knew that he was a really smart guy, and that he was also very strange. And unlike pretty much anybody you've ever met who has ever run a company, I know some people who are like Sam, but they don't run companies. That part of it was. There was another part where he mentioned that Sam said at one point that everybody over the age of 40 was obsolete. And that's part of the reason why he kicked them out from all his companies. He ignored advice from lawyers. I mean, this is stuff that I think many of us have seen in our interactions with FTX is the fact that everybody who worked there was in their twenties, more or less."

And it's like, okay, it's very difficult to then buy the story that this was a poorly designed scheme, and Doe didn't know this was going to happen. And it's like, oh, no, you actually knew this whole time. And similarly, with FTX, the more evidence that comes out, the more damning it is that this is simply fraud from the very beginning."

So I think this is one place where Tarun and I seem to disagree, which is the question of the genuineness of Sam's intentions versus what he actually did. So very obviously, at this point, what Sam did was very fraudulent. All this stuff about the accounting backdoors and all the stuff that they did in order to obfuscate the fact that Alameda had privileged accessing the exchange, and even when they claimed they didn't, and blah, blah, blah, all this stuff. So very clearly, there was a lot of subterfuge and a lot of fraud taking place at FTX. The core question, though, is like, and this is, it seems like to be the central conflict of the book is, were Sam's intentions genuine, of wanting to be an effective altruist, wanting to improve the world, blah, blah, blah. It seems to me like it's hard to come away with the answer not being yes. I don't know, Tarun, if you still disagree with that, because it seemed like after, when we did the show, after the FTX collapse, you disagree with it."

He's much nicer than Sam, let's say. But I. There is, he's a real estate. Yeah, yeah, he's a real aesthetic billionaire. And so there's sort of this thing of, like, I think he realized that was, like, a very clear way to differentiate himself in a market filled with sharks, like, you know, Justin sun and CZ and people that, you know, like, they're extremely transparent in that dimension, right? Like, their utility function is, like, make more money or have more volume or whatever, right? Almost so transparent that it can be viewed as gross to a certain type of people. But those certain type of people who also have a lot of money, they need a narrative to be wooed, to be swooned, to part with their capital. And his entire thing was about making that narrative and that it was about trying to be, like, the western institution friendly, but I'm still money grubbing type of person. And there's just, like, a general level of selfishness with him that I think was so palpable that it was hard to square that with the other stuff he said. And look, I feel like my first job was working with a billionaire who's spending all his money on doing science research and all I have to say is I've seen people who actually give away their money, and I will tell you that there's no fucking way in hell Sam was close to that."

The dollar coming in is being used to pay a dollar out. In this case, they actually had a great real business. If no one ever cast aspersions of the business, there hadn't been a customer, a run on customer deposits, they'd still be sitting there making tons of money. Right now. The reality is, and I think actually Michael Lewis, he mentions this in the interview, that FTX us was a total failure. FTX us had almost no deposits. It had very few users. They had almost no market share. And almost all the money he was spending on marketing was in the us market. Right. Their biggest market was Korea. Second biggest market, I believe, was Singapore. Their market share was almost entirely outside of the US. And so the idea that, well, he was such a great cultural figure and it really resonated with people. People outside the US didn't give a shit that he was a effective altruist or whatever. They just trade on FTX because it's just another crypto exchange."

I think those are two very different claims, and that is kind of the claim that Michael Lewis makes, is that he thinks that Sam lost his way, but fundamentally he was more or less the same guy. Like, he never really believed in crypto. He always saw crypto as instrumental. And that I think everybody who's ever met Sam agrees with is that Sam was not a true believer. He didn't really care that much about the industry. He just want. He saw it as an opportunity to make money, but it wasn't because he just, you know, he loves cars or private jets or whatever. Like, clearly he was, he was motivated by all the shit that he was doing. And you can argue that he was incredibly ineffective at doing it. Clearly he's done way more damage to effective altruism than any single person ever, and way more damage to every single one of the causes that he was trying to endorse. Probably gave more ammunition to Republicans than Democrats in retrospect. But I think it's hard to argue that he, that it was a facade."

And then at some point he realized leaning into it, but not really believing the doctrine was more valuable. Now, do you tell me, would you tell me that's still genuine intent? I don't think so. I actually think that means that you're sort of like, you're piggybacking off a movement that in a way that is like disingenuous to its actual ideals.

He spent billions of dollars of money that didn't belong to him to pump up the SBF and FTX brand. Billions of dollars. How much money did he actually spend on altruistic things that weren't about pumping up SPF and FTX? How much did he actually spend on really furthering the world or charity or genuinely good causes? Very, very little. And when I just look at the actual track record, yeah, sure. I bet even $5 billion to Trump was going to all be about the SBF, like slayed the Dragon marketing campaign if it ever happened. Right. Like, all of it was not altruism. All of it was selfish. That I can see. And so, like, even if he originally started off on this path of trying to do the most amount of good by making the most amount of money and giving it back, the track record doesn't say it's a yemenite. The track record says that he was just extremely selfish. And whether he started that way or not. I don't know.

One would assume that he probably would not want to show his face outside of Dubai, where I understand he's normally living, but he was picked up for contempt of court. So I think a lot of people were hoping that, oh, my God, Suzu has been arrested. It's probably for being a bad person and crashing the market. But the reason why he was arrested and why he was he's serving four months in jail for contempt of court is because of his unresponsiveness in the bankruptcy proceedings. So basically, he's not picking up the phone and being cooperative, and that's why he is in jail. So presumably now he will be forced to cooperate with the liquidators. But as far as we know, there's not been any broader criminal charges that have been brought or alleged against Suzu. So not quite the resolution we wanted, but at this point now we do have the major crypto villains of the last cycle. SPF now under trial. Do Kwon, also under arrest awaiting his trial and Suzu in jail."

That said, I think the media attention will end once there's a guilty verdict. Like, there will be. I mean, at this point, almost everybody expects that there will be a guilty verdict on at least some of the charges. There will be appeals and there will be other charges brought in, blah, blah, blah, blah. But like, once you get the first guilty verdict, it's kind of like, ah, everyone sort of breathes a sigh of relief. Justice system has worked. Now there's a question of sentencing and blah, blah, blah and whatnot. But more or less the answer that everyone was waiting for arrives, which is that, okay, he's, he's, he's going to serve some time in prison. I think that was also kind of true of Elizabeth Holmes. Like, I believe, you know, even she started her prison sentence like within the last year, I think. But the totality of the attention and the grip that it had on the nation ended way before that. And so I think that'll probably also be true of SPF. And I think crypto on the whole, I feel like the two big milestones are one, the SPF verdict, at least one guilty verdict that, okay, there will be prison time despite the other cases and the appeals and whatever. And then second is when people get paid back from FTX. So when you start seeing people getting their money back, whether it's forty cents, fifty cents, sixty cents on the dollar, whatever it ends up being in the end, then people can finally move on and say, okay, that was a bad story. Crazy for those who lived through it, but now there's just not that much more to talk about. And I feel like we kind of need that as an industry to be able to really move forward.

        "text": "Direct all of our souls. Okay, so one more topic I want to talk about in the time that we have left. So there was a blog post that was dropped by Vitalik recently that's got a lot of people talking. And the subject of this blog post is protocol enshrinement. So protocol entrinement is this idea where you have a lot of innovations taking place at the application layer. So people building things like liquid staking, people building things like private mempools or MEV auctions or different precompiles, all this stuff, much of the stuff that we invest in and we look at as investors and as thinkers in the crypto space. The question that he asked in his blog post is when does it make sense to say, ah, this thing is so important to what is happening in Ethereum and potentially even jeopardizes the neutrality of Ethereum to allow all this innovation just be happening in the application layer, that it makes sense to grab some of this stuff and pull it up into the protocol layer itself and so called enshrine it into the protocol. So naturally this has been done in the past with things like precompiles. Precompiles are when you have some piece of code that runs so often or so useful generally, that's very inefficient to do directly in the Ethereum virtual machine. And so instead you have basically this machine code that's highly optimized that runs this thing for you so that it's not as gas inefficient as it would be running it in the EVM. The question is, are there more things that we should quote unquote precompile or build directly into the base layer? A lot of this conversation has been triggered by Lido. So Lido, for those of you who don't know, is a liquid staking protocol. We are investors into Lido. Basically what they do is they allow you to tokenize your liquid staking stake and trade it, trade in and out of it, but you could just passively sit in it and get yield and sell it anytime you want to. So lido has now risen to something like 30, 30 ish percent of total ETH staking deposits. Is that correct?"

        "text": "32, 33. And there's a lot of concern now that it is becoming one of the most dominant single players in the staking universe and that perhaps there should be something done at the protocol layer to avert the dominance of Lido, because it could be a threat to protocol security if there's a single proof of stake actor, that single actor, even though the proponents of Lido would argue, well, lido, it's a decentralized system, there are a bunch of different validators that are in the Lido network. So Lido looks like one big thing, but actually it's like 30 validators or something, whatever. Some large number of professional validators that are part of the Lido network. And so when stake goes to Lido, it's actually split among all these different validators, and they would have to individually collude with each other. It's not like Lido is one big monolith. That's the pro argument. There's a lot of people on the anti side who say Lido is unsafe. And I think a lot of that is what triggered this discussion from Vitalik. So curious to get your guys reactions to this enshrinement conversation. And if you feel in particular about Lido, because it seems to be driving a lot of this conversation, whether there should be something that takes place at the protocol layer to avert the dominance of lido in staking."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Well, I think the first debate is, is the dominance a problem? And I think within the community, there's obviously two very different views. And like, I think it's still too early to say that it necessarily is a problem. Right. If it's a problem and a large enough portion of the Ethereum community, staking community, protocol developers, et cetera, think that it's a problem, then it's like, move to step b. How do you potentially take some of these pieces and move them into the Ethereum protocol? I don't know. I think it's almost more contentious to resolve that Lido is a problem because it's a successful application. Just because it's successful does not make it necessarily a problem."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, I think it was entirely predictable that there would be concentration and extremely positive strong network effects around liquid staking ahead of time. So I'm kind of surprised this was nothing discussed. And I think the intention or the decision not to include liquid staking was intentional to avoid sort of the few validator concentration that you get with dpos. And so we're kind of just bouncing around these different things where it's like we want. And now even the EFSR meant there being too many validators and that potentially slowing consensus and slowing down. So it's like you can't have your cake and eat it too, where you want a bunch of validators, but you don't want too many validators and you want liquid staking, but you don't want there to be this third party dominant liquid staking provider. These are just sort of classic, I think, market dynamics playing out as predicted. And I think to Vidocq's point in the blog post too, he talks about, well, if we did build something like this and try another protocol, it would probably look like rocket pool. And so people can offer that today if they want, but it would effectively just be placing something like that as a primitive in Ethereum."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It's very clear one of the design goals of Ethereum proof of stake was that they really wanted to encourage home stakers, people just running on their own commodity hardware, some staking stuff, so that the staking pool, or it's not staking pool, the validator set is as broad as possible and involves as much normal folks on commodity hardware. It's very clear that that drove a lot of their decisions, such as, for example, to not allow delegation. As you mentioned, Tom, the delegation now is the mainstay of a lot of proof of stake networks. Ethereum was like, no, we don't want that because we don't want to get this concentration of professional validators, that normal users will just point their lasers at this great validator and they don't run anything themselves. And then you just get this concentration of validators. They were like, look, we're just going to make it hard. We're going to make it hard for users to delegate or to do something like delegation. Then hopefully that's going to create this ecosystem of home validators. Instead, what we see is that the market gives people what they want. And what people want is they want a passive way to get access to staking yield while delegating the responsibility of actually staking to others. And that's Lido and rocket pool and all these other staking systems. It does seem like there was a little bit of overengineering or maybe over optimism about their ability to centrally plan how Ethereum staking would be composed. And in a certain sense it's backfiring now when they see, oh, wow, okay, it looks like, regardless of what we want people to do, people want a lido like thing. They want a liquid staking token. And now we have to deal with the consequence of that without a lot of tools with which to mediate that market."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "I think there's another aspect to this that's actually extremely important in practice that people don't consider, which is that the reason you have some of these dominant effects is not just strictly the idea that, like, hey, this particular staking pool service is the safest or has the longest track record, but it's actually liquidity based, where, like, people who have the staked asset, they may need to borrow against it for some reason, or they may need to sell and not wait the withdrawal period. And the withdrawal period is for a security reasons that you can't just, like, immediately take your stake, Ethan, remove eth out of it. But you may just like, I don't know, you use this collateral, or like, you got liquidated somewhere and you need to post more money somewhere, or you need eth for some other reason. And Lido, from its inception, focused insanely hard on incredibly insane, probably insane, in hindsight, amounts of liquidity incentives to get to that point. I think an interesting point about the rocket pool model is rocket pool itself kind of is a bad model in some ways, because the RPL token, it doesn't have any other fee accrual mechanism. So if the RPL token goes down a lot, then the security of the rocket pool validators is actually quite a bit in trouble. On the other hand, if Ethereum offers a rocket pool, I think that's great because it has natural transaction carry coming in from all the transactions."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Can you, real quick, for the audience, explain the difference between the lido system and the radical system?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, so very, very high level. The lido system is like a staking pool. So you give your eth to it. So maybe you put two ETH, Haseeb puts in 30 eth, Robert puts in 16.9 eth, and Tom puts in 400. Ethnic. And it makes a pool that adds up everything, which is around 550 or something like that. And basically it takes that pool and it says, okay, each of us own a pro rata share. So, like, Tom owns 400 divided by that, and I own 1.6 or whatever divided by that. And then that pool is owned by a single validator, or, well, really a set of validators who use that stake, use the pool that we gave to get to where they are. Rocket pool does something slightly different where it has the validators contributing some of the ETH and the depositors contributing some of the ETH, and in order to deal with getting slashed. So the losses, how do the losses flow through from the validators and then to the users? Is that the validators? ETH sort of is usually the first tranche. But if say, there's more slashing, you need some more security. They have their own token that you have to stake. The problem is that thing has no real fundamental fee driven value. So yes, if there's a great Ponzi time, yes, it will grow high and whatever, but when the value of that crashes, the security of their system is much more unsafe. Whereas in the lido type of system, as long as there's many validators validating a single pool so that you don't get slashed for liveness faults, it is generally significantly safer. Now there's other consequences because Lido is the governance token, but Lido is introducing dual staking. So I think that hopefully should ameliorate a lot of that also. Disclaimer, we are also lido investors, but I think the rock and pull models have a lot of merit because they do kind of lower. They do force the validators to have skin in the game. In the Lido model they will have more, but they make it more explicit. But I guess my point is, if Ethereum validators who are earning income in Ethereum are able to provide some fraction of their income into as their costs, they have to provide to the structure. It makes a lot more sense than Ethereum validators who are earning RPL, selling RPL, or barring against RPL to contribute ethan, then that RPL token, they're kind of like net negative on the RPL. They're either selling it or borrowing against it. So you can have these very bad interactions in the worst case, like really bad slashing events. Now of course, there's barely been any slashing, but I guess long story short is I actually think this enshrining thing is like once you do one thing, you have to do everything, say ethereum enshrines the rocket pool type of thing. Well, now they're going to have to source liquidity for I saw people jokingly on the Internet calling it Ef ETH, like Ethereum foundation eth. So for Ef ETH, you would need to have liquidity, and the liquidity we need to own be owned in some ways by the protocol. And now you'd be enshrining a uniswap to ensure that I could trade out of Ef ETH to ETH and then I'd need it in trying to compact. So I actually think it's not an easy thing to do. And I think that, that if you don't understand the market dynamics, you might think, okay, we just add the one gizmo and it works. But it's actually this kind of quite complex web, and you may have to actually continually import the whole thing. So maybe that's my more nuanced view of the."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, it's also the reality is that, look, anything that Ethereum decides to enshrine goes at Ethereum development speed, which means it's going to be like fucking two years. It's going to be like a three part upgrade, and it's going to be like two years or three years from now that we actually get the like Ethereum enshrined rocket pool or whatever. And until then, okay, well, whatever centralization vectors you're worried about in just the raw marketplace are going to continue moving forward for the next three years. So one way or another, like I think, I mean, this, this is a drum that I constantly like to beat, which is that, uh, you know, a lot of people, especially in crypto economic design, really want to shy away from social consensus as being an enforcement mechanism in blockchains. And they just are like, they just always are, they always have been. And I think Dankrad posted something about this which I, which I very strongly agreed with, which is that the number one thing that keeps Ethereum on path is not the crypto economic mechanisms. They're never enough. You never are going to have a sufficiently specified crypto economic system that no bad thing can happen given all the incentives that you've constructed around you. You always need to have some culture that's pushing people in the right direction. And a large part of that, you can see it from Lido. Lido is intentionally trying to contort themselves with this dual staking and the governance structure that they have to try to make it so that they are responsive to the overall needs of Ethereum governance, rather than just token go up."

And so that's been interesting, but I mean, it sounds like he's been researching and planning something for a while.
