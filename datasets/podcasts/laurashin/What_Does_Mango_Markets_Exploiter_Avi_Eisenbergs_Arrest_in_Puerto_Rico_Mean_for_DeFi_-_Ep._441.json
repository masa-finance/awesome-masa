And again, the only reason why I know this is because I actually witnessed him trying to give a defense of fortress and some post fey rari manipulation stuff that he was involved in.

The day before this podcast was released, the CFTC charged Avi Eisenberg with violations of the Commodity Exchange act and manipulation and attempted manipulation of a swap. A link in the show notes to the complaint, but I just wanted to explain why we don't mention this news in the show. Today we're discussing the arrest of Manko Market's exploiter, Avi Eisenberg, and its implications for DeFi. Here to discuss are Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, and Collins Belton, managing partner at Brookwood PC. Welcome, Gabriel and Collins."

        "text": "No comment. All right, so, two days after Christmas, Avi Eisenberg, most famously known as the mango markets exploiter, was arrested by the Department of Justice in Puerto Rico for commodities fraud and commodities manipulation. Avi had famously kind of already confessed, although I don't think he thought what he did was anything wrong. And this was in a tweet, which most people have heard, in which he described the mango markets exploit as a highly profitable trading strategy. So, for those of you who don't recall the details, Avi took out a large portion on Mango's perpetual futures contracts. He then inflated the price of the illiquid mango token, or that's what inflated the price of the liquid mango token. And then he used that inflated value of his holdings as collateral to borrow pretty much all the protocol's assets, and then he drained the protocol. So I was curious, just for your take, generally, and why don't we start with maybe Gabriel, who wrote the tweet thread that kind of sparked this conversation. Do you think that what Avi did in this case actually qualifies as commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, as he was charged with?"

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Well, yeah, I would say that overall, what he did, I would consider within the ethical norms of the defi space, but nevertheless, most likely illegal. Or at least there's a strong argument that it's illegal, which makes it kind of interesting, right? We have things that are ethical but illegal and also things that are legal but unethical. And then sometimes they're both illegal and unethical. I think this was one thing where ethically, within the norms of defi, in my opinion, it is fine, but it is illegal. Whether it constitutes fraud is a very interesting question. I do believe it, like, constitutes some form of manipulation, some form of cornering. But who exactly the defrauded party is, right, because a smart contract isn't a person. And it kind of was the smart contract that was deceived, or arguably it was the risk engine for the smart contract that was deceived is, you know, creates some interesting issues that I guess we'll talk further about. But, yeah, I do think that there's a strong claim here that he did something illegal."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, you know, I think I'd largely agree, especially on the distinction between his manipulation and arguably fraud charges. I think, you know, to the extent that there is something that's likely to hold, I would, I would imagine the manipulation charges are a bit easier here just under the blackletter law since there's a little bit less of this intentional question. I think, especially given what you've said. You know, he explicitly kind of did note on online that he manipulated the market in order to achieve this. Like Gabe said, though, you know, when you look at kind of our defi norms, there's a question as to whether people should have expected something like this when he did operate within the parameters of the system. So I think we'll talk a little bit about that. One other thing that Gabe just alluded to that I find kind of interesting is that when you look at the fraud question, I think a lot of the people, especially in the mango community, want to take the position that he essentially defrauded the Dow or the members. But this kind of leads to a weird catch 22. And it's kind of funny because the complaint actually takes this position, at least from my perspective, where the Dow essentially is, to say, hey, we run this thing and you took our assets, which then puts them in the uncomfortable position of having to argue potentially in another context as to whether they should be the ones seen as running an exchange. So there's a weird tension here, and hopefully we can talk a little bit about that. I think that was part of, you know, at the heart of Gabe's threat there as to how this may impact defi depending on how people want to interpret this."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So both things that you guys said were so interesting. Well, we'll talk about Gabes first. I mean, the notion that what he did was both illegal, but also within the norms of Defi. Like, can you talk a little bit about that? Like, why is it that things that people would traditionally consider illegal are things that at least some segments of the crypto community may not consider out of bounds?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Sure. I mean, I think it raises very interesting questions, and it just always comes back to this code is law thing, right? If what we have is an under. If the social norms of using a crypto system are that it's supposed to do a certain thing, and everyone's understanding is that, and if the code does something different from what it's supposed to do, then we have an issue. If that's the social framework, then we have major, major issues across the entire cryptosystem ecology. Right. Because why do we have immutable statement, right. If we have a notion of what's supposed to happen and it doesn't happen and the wrong thing gets recorded, we should be able to mutate that state. If someone, if our notion of ownership is the same as in the real world, that is, you own your coins. Well, you know, if I get locked out of my car and I have some valuables in there, um, you know, like, I have legal methods to break back into the car or even someone else's car and get those things out. Right. Whereas on the blockchain there. There's no remedy for that. Right? I don't get your keys. I've just lost it forever, if I've lost my keys and so on. So we have this universe of pure, bare assets where basically what you can do with them determines what you ought to be able to do with them. That's the norm with which people operate in space. Not your keys, not your coins. Right. And the same thing with the smart contracts. Right. You know, in my opinion, unless you want to just recentralize everything and be able to reverse transactions and all these things, you really kind of have to be able to say that when someone is using one of these systems, they are opting into a situation where they want code to be law for them. Obviously, it doesn't necessarily mean it's law for external parties who haven't opted into that. Right. But we need it to be that when you opt in, you're able to give up the, you're able to consent to those risks, you're able to take on to those risks, that whatever the code does is the result you're going to accept. And the notion of prosecuting someone for using the code in a smarter way that other people didn't predict is anathema to that. Right. Because that really means, you know, if he was able to do that and if that's somehow wrong, right. If something that the code could do is the wrong result, that ultimately means that it's not the crypto system that governs things. It's our understandings and expectations. And if it's our understandings and expectations, well, then it's exactly like a normal contract, and it ought to be illegal or frowned upon to set things up in a way where you can't fully perform that contract because of immutability and these other things. So it's a real tension. And that's why I say, you know, really, we need to kind of find a way to make it acceptable for people to opt in this set of risks and understand what risks they're opting into. Also, of course, these hacks happen all the time, or it's not even really a hack, but these attacks, these exploits happen all the time, and the vast majority of people get away with it. And most people aren't even that mad about it in crypto. Like, they're not nearly as mad about the typical defi exploit as they are, or about FTX, for example, because, you know, it's just kind of considered the name of the game. Size your risk appropriately. Don't put all of your eggs into one protocol. Certainly don't put it into it. If it's open source. Sorry. If it's not open source or if it's brand new, it's insufficiently tested, it's not audited. We just have this whole other set of standards for when we're dealing with code that dramatically differ from, you know, when you're trading stocks on Nasdaq or something."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And so it's almost like you're saying that in the defi space, they would consider that in this particular situation, the developers of the smart contracts are almost more at fault or something like that. Is that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I don't know if it's the. It wasn't a smart contract code problem as such. It was really. And we should talk more about how the attack went down. But at the end of the day, it was a governance problem, I would say, as to the fact that this particular collateral, the mango token itself, the governance token for the protocol, too much was allowed to be borrowed against it within the protocol."

        "speaker": "A",

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Too much was allowed to be borrowed against it relative to its liquidity and the rest of its risk profile. And what else was going on in the profile. So it's not so much, I don't know that it was a developer problem. It's more of a governance risk management problem in terms of the assets that are whitelisted in the protocol and the collateral ratios that they have within the protocol."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "But I think it's kind of interesting you say that, because in some ways I do see it as, I don't know if I'd say it's a developer problem, but it's a system design issue. But it's compounded by the fact that you do have, in essence, this governance ability in and of itself, the ability for people to make those decisions, to be modifying them, is kind of what introduced that risk. Now, obviously, you know, they could have made this immutable, had the same risk by just setting the parameters in stone. But I think that also, you know, speaks to a little bit of the tension you alluded to. And then also some of the things that we were talking about before where you've got people that kind of want to have their cake and eat it too, to use the cliche phrase where, hey, you know, we want to be able to essentially say this is immutable and we're going to depend on code as law. But then when somebody like Gabe said, you know, figures out, you know, a clever, if not, and I don't like using the word ethical because it's ethical in one sense, I think in a pure, like, philosophical sense, but ethical in the sense of like, yeah, he knew that there were innocent and quote, unquote innocent people or users that would be deprived of their value. So I don't know if ethical from the colloquial sense is the best word. Let's just keep using it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "They weren't ultimately deprived of their value, though, were they?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, and that's, that's actually what I wanted to talk about, actually. So the private contracting element is kind of something that I think Gabe was alluding to. And part of that other point, I just kind of hopped to that, which is you've got this weird idea that blockchains in some way might be seen as allowing extreme versions of private contracting, but in this case it also runs headlong. And this is another tension that I think we wanted to talk about with the actual regulatory and legal framework that exists in reality. If you start looking at the intentions and things outside of, let's say, the four corners of your blockchain contract. And so we see that actually with mango, the Dow tried to negotiate a settlement with him where it included releasing criminal claims against him now, obviously, the us government is like, why? What are you talking about? None of this is something that we're going to respect. But it actually does highlight, again, an issue here, which is if you aren't going to essentially adhere to those norms of everything that's codified, is exactly how we will essentially accept these results, and instead go to, all right, we're going to add a meta layer of additional governance, whether that's via tokens, whether that's outside, you know, negotiation. Then you do start to introduce the exact tension that Gabe is talking about where the regulator is going to say, okay, well, why wouldn't we also step in? Why wouldn't the other frameworks also apply here? And so I think this is what I think, you know, when we were talking about the motivation for the episode, the interesting thing is, all right, well, there's, you have to almost take a position here. Either you want this, you know, codes law. And by the way, I don't think either of us, you know, let me know if I'm speaking wrong for you, but I don't think either of us are saying code is law is the exact lay of the land now. Or we're saying if this is the norm that people are going to adhere to and they're going to espouse, then they can't. And those other times start saying, hey, you violated some, you know, hitherto for unspoken norm that we just made up on the spot because we're pissed off about losing money. And so I think this is, and this is honestly a challenge I have with governance systems and crypto generally. I think you either have ungoverned systems. I think there's some world, we'll probably figure out a governance system that will avoid some of these flaws. But right now, most of the governance systems introduce these exact tensions by virtue of just being a governance system that introduce outside decision making."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. And I think Collins just raised a really, I agree with all that. And Colin just raised a very interesting point, legal point, but he didn't state it completely explicitly. So I just want to make sure the listeners are clear. Right. There are two potential things that are implicated in electronic attacks. Right. One is sort of computer fraud, abuse, anti hacking type of laws. Right. And those are not the charges that have been brought against Avi. Whether they could bring such charges would be an interesting question. But those are, generally speaking, specific computer statutes that say that, for example, prohibit unauthorized access of data, unauthorized use of access credentials such as passwords and things of this nature. And they're phrased generally in those terms, although they often also have catchalls that can be vaguer. And that was not what is here. Right, because he didn't really use, he didn't steal someone's password or generate someone's password by repeated guesses, brute forcing. Instead, what he did is manipulating the price of an asset in a way that, when combined with the functioning of a certain set of code, enabled him to get a good result. Right. And it wasn't that there was any flaw in the code. There was no flaw in the code. There also, a lot of people describe this as an oracle manipulation attack, but it wasn't actually an exploit of the oracle. The oracle functioned completely correctly. It accurately reported the prices. He went to the markets that the oracles pull price data from, and he did transactions that basically made the accurate, true price of that asset on that platform to be artificially high. Right. And that's why they're bringing this as a manipulation claim rather than some sort of computer hacking claim, etcetera. But both set of laws, in terms of the broader discussion about consent and private contracting, could be relevant. And in terms of the computer hacking laws, you can actually cure that issue with concern. Right. That's why there are pen testing programs. That's why there are bug bounty programs, because the specific relevant parties, it's a little harder in crypto for various reasons, but you can at least try to get everyone relevant to say, yes, we consent to certain people or anyone under certain circumstances attacking this and trying to do it harm if they follow this certain protocol. You cannot do that with market manipulation. And I think the reason why you can't do that with market manipulation is because the implicit theory of who is being defrauded with these price manipulations is the market itself. It's everyone in the market. It's not only the mango users who are the ones who had the most potential risk in terms of direct economic harm, but it's everyone. And so even if every single mango user literally signed a contract giving them a release, which of course, is not what happened, even then, they still would, the government would still be able to bring this action. So that's why it raises very interesting issues around consent, private contracting, etcetera."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Also, one other thing, which we won't go deep on this episode on, but I'll give Gabe the dunk on me on this, is for a while, there's been people debating on, is it better for something to be regulated from the securities angle, at the commodities angle, I think this definitely shows in conjunction with some other stuff like Ookie Dow, that, you know, stepping into the commodities row doesn't absolve all of these issues. And I still am of the belief that a lot of times the CFTC is probably the more appropriate regulator. And I should also note, you know, this is the DOJ bringing this, although I would, you know, be very shocked if we do not see CFTC follow up on this. But I think it, you know, highlights that, you know, the fact that the CFTC or the FBI agent in this case, one, you know, highlighted that he thought some of the assets were commodities, but that actually led them to the belief that these things were swaps, that he was actually trading perpetuals or swaps. There's actually a statement I actually copied out for the episode here where, you know, the FBI agent just explicitly says, he starts a sentence saying perpetuals are swaps under the CEA. It's not like, it's not a question in his mind. It's not a theory. That's actually very problematic for, you know, a lot of DeFi protocols if they want to be serving us participants and they're going to have, let's say, a Dow running the exchange and it's not fully immutable. So, you know, this type of thing is a good example of how even though I might still believe the CFTC is more appropriate, it's good that we had leaked something like the DCCPA and people to understand that the CFTC doesn't mean, oh, suddenly you're cool, like, hey, they regulate gold and oil and they don't really care about those spot markets because it's very clear. They say here, the FBI agents looking at this like, hey, he manipulated the spot price in order to leverage swaps on a decentralized exchange so that he could achieve this result. And that's what led to the manipulation charges. That's what led to the fraud charges. And again, you know, I'd note that while this isn't a CFTC complaint, the FBI agent and I have this excerpt here where he explicitly notes that, you know, the mango decentralized exchanges is run by the mango Dow that I think is going to be interesting to track. That's a statement that I think will probably show back up in the near future, but we'll see."

He said, I don't remember how you started, but you kept kind of trying to explain what he did with the prices, and then finally you settled on that. He artificially inflated the price. But what was interesting is when he came on my show right after he had done the hack, I similarly remember what question it was that I asked or what phrasing I used, but he corrected me by saying, oh, well, no, that was actually the real price at that moment. Like, just because it's not what anyone wants doesn't mean that it wasn't the correct price."

So we kind of started touching on, you know, different aspects of this even before went to the ad break. But let's maybe start with Gabriel's Twitter thread, because Gabriel, you know, as much as I think a lot of people believe that kind of Avi, what Avi did was wrong in some sense, your conclusion in the Twitter thread was that this isn't necessarily good for Defi, that he got arrested. So what do you fear are some of the indirect consequences for the DeFi space that could result?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "The whole point of these systems is that they be secure on an autonomous, decentralized basis, which means that you can't rely for safety on extrinsic deterrence, such as fear of punishment, or extrinsic actors who may be able to reverse transactions, adjudicate which transactions were correct or incorrect. The idea is that it be secure, robust, consistent on its own, that it be so well designed that it can do that. Right. To do that. It's really, and, you know, just look at the history of smart contract security dating all the way back to the Dow Hackley. Or you can even look at l one s in terms of consensus attacks, validator attacks, miner attacks. When the developers try to develop these systems to be as secure as they can, things happen. And we learn lessons. It's an iterative process. Because of the DaO hack, reentry attacks are very, very, a rare flaw in smart contracts, I would say. If one happens now, it's just due to negligence at this point, almost always, right? You didn't get an audit, you didn't know what you were doing, whatever. But that's because that hack happened and had really bad consequences and made everyone alert to that. And then they develop systems for automatically scanning code for that vulnerability and improving design patterns and all these things. So we actually need these attacks in order for the ecosystem to grow and to ultimately become the best it could be. The same is true even is recognized even with centralized systems, because they have bug bounty programs and all these things. The difference is that, as I mentioned earlier, for something like Twitter, if Twitter wants its web app to be secure, they can have a bug bounty program. And really, the only thing that those, that any sort of bugs or potential exploits can come from is most likely going to be some type of code vulnerability, one of these types of vulnerabilities that is covered by the anti hacking statutes. And so they can consent to it being attacked. And the. The hacker will be, the white hat will be okay. I'm wearing a black hat, but the white hat will be okay if they follow those rules and they will be able to prove their system iteratively with these economic attacks. It's just not possible to give that consent. But nevertheless, we do want these systems to be secure against all types of attacks, including ones that you can't fully consent to. This is the issue. We don't want to start relying on the legal system to make these systems secure. We want them to be intrinsically secure. That means people have to attack them. Now, do they have to attack them the exact way Avi did? No, because he could have someone leaked discord messages that are alleged to be from him or someone contemplating a similar attack in the weeks ahead of time where he was saying, hey, I found this vulnerability, but it looks like there's not much in the treasury. So I think the white hat bounty would be small. So it was better for him to attack the whole thing and decide his own white hat bounty. But we could, as an industry, and I think there are people working on this for sure, jump published a thing. And I know kind of a coalition of VC's and white hats are working on something where you would set out clear parameters for attacks. You would potentially even have, like pool more pooled money by a coalition of protocols to reward people so the reward could be sufficiently large. And all these things we need to keep doing this. We can't be scared to do this because of, for certain attacks, because those attacks can't be fully mitigated with consents and waivers, but that when we do go and talk to big law firms about setting up some type of white hat safe harbor, that is what they say. They say, well, you can only reward the code exploits that violate the computer fraud statutes because these other ones are manipulating the entire market, and you're not the entire market. So guess what? You can't consent to that. But we can't let that stop innovation because otherwise these protocols will never be secure on autonomous and decentralized terms because they won't get attacked enough."

        "text": "Yeah, it's kind of funny because I think like a year or two ago, we were talking about the idea of indemnity funds and insurance funds, but those indemnity funds were at the time focused on some of the operators of things like daos and participants that might be at risk. But I think since then it's probably expanded to be a more necessary conversation. On a broad basis, I would say Gabe focused a lot on the lack of vulnerability testing that we may suffer from in the absence or in the presence of a regime that applies like this. I actually think one of the more straightforward things is that there are a number of different DeFi models that are currently employed by different, almost core infrastructure pieces at this point that arguably are going to come under scrutiny as acceptable if something especially like the manipulation or front running claims get treated as something actionable by the government moving forward. And what I mean by that is we can take, let's say, two or three of the more common or probably most popular, let's say, infrastructure plays right now with MeV MeV and some characterization might be seen. We're not in some characterization. It does essentially take the concept of front running, operationalize it, and then democratize it amongst the entire spectrum of users such that, you know, it makes it more fair. But there is an argument, and this isn't my position necessarily, but I think, you know, if I'm steel manning this from the CFTC or the DOJ's perspective, and I want to apply something similar to Avi, my argument is essentially going to be, well, look, it looks like you guys are just saying you've operationalized and democratized front running for everybody willing to participate in your playground. It's not that you got rid of it or something like that. It's that instead you're protecting this network by essentially enabling everybody to do so, and in doing so, cutting down the risk of one or two particular actors being able to manipulate that. But here's the thing. There's no like safe harbor or exemption in the CEA for like, oh, the manipulation is like good for everybody. So it's cool. So like, this is the type of characterization that I think people have to think a little bit about. You also have Dexs and some of the Dex types of plays that rely on Mev, like plays that are going to be doing things, you know, and I won't, you know, name. I think everyone knows particulars at this point. Or there's, you know, essentially an l two version of this for every, you know, major aggregator where they're doing something like they're ordering transactions on l two network or on an off chain basis and then submitting them in ways that provide front running protection. So again, these are all things that I think are positive for the system. These are things that are one. Again, as Gabe has highlighted, in the absence of traditional legal systems, we're going to need systems, algorithms, structures that essentially enable us to either mitigate or control for or protect against certain risks that the legal system typically does. And in order to do that, we do kind of need some of that experimentation. I do tend to agree. I don't think Avi's approach was greatest. But, by the way, just as we go through this, I realize we're halfway through this episode. I want to note, I can't speak for Gabe on this. Maybe I can, but, like, I don't think this episode should be looked at as, like, a defense of Avi or, like, you know, prosecutors are looking at this. God forbid he gets off on, like, some weird quote from this episode. I actually, you know, witnessed some of his takes. Like, he was also involved in the Spey Rory collapse, and he actually was also involved in his own projects collapse, where he also used the system as intended with Fortress Dao, in order to have people vote for a project that he was affiliated with, did not fully disclose things there, and then essentially, you know, made the same legal arguments as he's done here, which is to say, hey, I've used the system as intended. I submitted this all through governance. You all essentially consented to this. And so, yes, I should be able to walk away with these treasury assets. Interestingly, you know, I'm surprised that this has not yet come up, and perhaps, you know, they'll likely discover this, because I think it's the same bucket of things. But I did just want to add that last part before we get back into how this impacts defi. This is not supposed to be, like, a, yeah, you did it. She saved us all. Or something like that."

You know, like I said, I think most people in crypto view, what Avi did is, like, wrong in some respects. But then I found it fascinating that Gabriel was saying that this could set up kind of bad precedent for DeFi. And so I wanted to explore that. But, Collins, you keep on mentioning kind of the role of the DAO and how that could also kind of, I think, or how this case could present conundrums for daos in general. Like, you've raised the issue about whether daos want to be seen as running exchanges. I feel like there was another point. Can you talk a little bit about how this case could affect daos that run protocols like these?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. And I think, you know, to talk about that, we could take a quick step back to Uki Dao that happened a few months ago. And for those that are aware, there was essentially an exploit that happened in another protocol. There were some allegations that essentially the assets that were traded there are involved. There were regulated commodity assets. But in relevant part for this discussion, there is a Dow involved in the operation of that protocol. And in that case, the CFTC. And the DOJ's position is that the Dow is essentially running that protocol which allows for derivative types of transactions. The issue is that prior to going after the Dow, they looked at the founders and said, hey, we think you're liable for some of these things. The founders settled and now you have this question of, okay, well, who at the Dow, could one respond to this receive service? You know, who should be liable? Can they apportion the debt in this way? This has been a question that people have been talking about, but I think it's, I think it's a little less controversial in that case than if the same type of thing was alleged here. And the reason why I say that is because in this mango situation, they're explicitly just saying, hey, you guys are operating an exchange that allows for the swap of regulated commodities exchanges. Now, the issue is, if that is the position that's accepted, let's say, at a court level and something like that, they're essentially saying, hey, this DAO is an organization. Whether you want to call it an unincorporated association, whether you want to call it an Inc, whatever it is, this organization is running this thing, you would normally need some type of licensure to do so. In the absence of that, you guys are all liable for not having this license. In addition, just like we've seen in Uki and other situations, typically when you have something that's a licensed entity, like a DCM or some type of futures exchange, you also have those same type of money laundering and sanctions obligations that we've seen everybody freaking out, rightfully so, over the past year and a half. Those things like, not only do you have to conduct AML and KYC, but you're blocking geo fencing off Iran and North Korea and all of these places. Now, obviously, the Dow is one not equipped to do that right now. They don't do that. And I think their position would be, hey, I, we manage some treasury, we don't really operate this exchange. But that was already an issue that was pronounced in Uki Dao. And I think here should have come out, would really explode and ripple across the rest of the space, because UKi, there is an argument at least, that the way in which the keys were transferred from the original founders to the DAO may have left the DAO with some operational control that might be untenable. I actually don't think that's a great argument, but I could at least, again, if I'm trying to steal man the CFTC's position, I could at least see that as far as I'm aware, in the mango holder situation, they don't maintain keys that could change significant parameters. I'm going to assume that's the case. And even if they did, I think there is no evidence, or at least nothing has alleged in the complaint that they were actually doing so in connection with this attack or even prior. It's just that, hey, they had some governance control, perhaps they can change some parameters. But none of that was at issue here. It was just, hey, the guy just ran this exchange, but they're saying, hey, this exchange in and of itself is an exchange that would normally have to be registered in order to run these things. So I think the implication for a lot of daos set up this way is, hey, either we take this position that yet defrauded the Dow, the Dow is owed something, but then you're in the uncomfortable position of saying, okay, well, if they defrauded us, as the operators of this, do we have responsibility for it? And then I think it goes back to the art, instead of should we be looking at system designs again, going back to our defi norms where that isn't even, that's not even a possible question or solution. I don't think people should be in the position of saying, hey, we operate this protocol. But unfortunately, as I think some people in our community have rightfully pointed out, it's arguably irresponsible to launch something like mango or something like that from day one. Totally immutable, totally unable to change anything, totally unable to rectify mistakes. Because, I mean, again, I mean, think about this wasn't even a hack. This is just a system design issue. But we've seen countless hacks where, you know, arguably, let's assume it wasn't an insider attack. Arguably, it probably would have been better for somebody to have like an emergency key to stop something when they couldn't, or perhaps it was a multi sig and they couldn't get consensus fast enough to stop an attack. So, you know, while I obviously think that on a long term basis having these like very, very kind of immutable designs as almost a rigid standard are ideal, there's a harsh reality that I think all of us that are like decentralization maxis have to accept, which is unless you have very simple and narrow systems. There's some interim period where, unfortunately, it's probably better for folks to maintain some control in order to avoid these risks. But then you have this tension that gets introduced here."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I think it's been a little bit too much of a convex thing where it's either immutable or you just have complete arbitrary powers of some multisig to do absolutely anything. And there is a lot of in between there. And I think there's like, not only in between in terms of different things that protocols have done, but I think there's a very unexplored design space. Like, for example, curve has an emergency multi segment, which I'm actually a member of, and I don't have any indemnities or anything from them, but I'm pretty comfortable with it because its powers are extremely limited. All it can do is freeze a pool and switch it into withdrawal only mode or stop the curve rewards to a pool, and then it's overrulable by the full down. You could also imagine a multisig that has the power to just do one thing, which is put a particular proposal on a much shorter to the Dow, on a much shorter voting scale schedule. There are a lot of different mechanisms you could play with. And again, a key takeaway, right, is that there are two sources of liability. One is, was there some negligent design or something like that that enabled this particular exploit to happen? And the other is, well, just the whole thing in general, did it require some type of license or is it required to be operated in some other way? You know, and is there a liability for that? Both are bad problems and both are sadly probably relevant here, although I think on the design aspect, like, I could make a straight face defense that no one in mango did anything wrong. There was no governance problem, no design problem, nothing. Like, yes, obviously, in retrospect, he could borrow too much from mango token. But, like, is it to the point where it's like reckless, like grossly negligent or whatever, that they said it that way? You could probably argue either way, right? So, yeah, these are two different issues."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, well, so, Collins, is that one of your concerns about the DAO, that, like, if it were determined that not only did Avi manipulate it, but that the kind of, you know, the exchange owners or operators, in this case the DAO, messed up by allowing that kind of collateral to be used in that way or without stricter limits or something like that, like, do you feel that that could be an implication here?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, not only could it be an implication. But I think it highlights the kind of issue here, right? Like one, you know, most of the DAO members, unless you're going to carve out the original developers who probably told some tokens or something, have no impact on the overall design of the system, like their governance powers, even to the extent, let's assume in this case that they did have some ability to, let's say, change some of the parameters, typically your governance control. And I know this is something I do know for sure, mango, they don't have the ability to just refactor the entire code base all of a sudden overnight. So it's limited to a certain set of inputs or parameters that they can tweak. And so it highlights kind of the issue. And we also with Uki Dao, where you're trying to establish some type of liability regime, if you're the government, you're saying, okay, well, do we go after the original devs? One, you can imagine a situation where, let's say mango wasn't originally allowed as collateral and the devs, and this actually does happen in DeFi protocols where they do things like they may not allow their token to be traded originally for other regulatory concerns and then let governance holders voted in. There would be a real question here, right in the hypothetical you just gave me, are the developers who originally developed this thing, but maybe it didn't have the quote unquote system design flaw because they didn't enable the collateral suddenly liable? Or should suddenly the community of token holders who voted for this be liable for introducing that design flaw? And if so, is the subset of people who voted for it so that you can apportion liability to them, like their individual partners who made that decision? Or should it be the aggregate dow, and then are they liable to the entire market or just to the other partners who lost value? All of those things kind of highlight the issue when you start thinking through this and you say, okay, well, hold on, none of that really is the right outcome here. One, because even to the extent that you felt bad for some of the, let's say, minority partners in the Dow, they kind of signed up for this, that their option is to either leave the Dow partnership or to go along with the vote that they all exceeded to when they kind of sign, let's say, informal constitution where you said, hey, I'm going to agree that the majority decision governs the parameter switches here. I'm going to agree that if something gets introduced like collateral, that I may not agree with, my only option is to either exit or to accept the decisions here. But once you start introducing these types of questions and potential legal liability regimes, you can start to see Gabe's former point, which is suddenly it upends and kind of undermines the entire notion of these systems. And it starts to do so not just when there's a conflict or an issue arises, but it actually does so even prior to the fact, because these types of decisions are going to be made, you know, a priori to some type of, you know, exploit, they're going to, people that hold the tokens are going to be making these same types of decisions if this type of liability regime applies, because they're going to know, hey, hold on, maybe we should or should not allow something like this to occur if the government is going to be able to show up in two years and say, hey, you know, 63% of you who voted for this are liable for the other 37%. So the entire dynamics of how Daos will work, I think, are upended by this. And yeah, it's a good example of an implication that might seem very limited, like, hey, maybe just these DAo members are going to be liable for something, but it won't be. Just like people are already starting to change and order their behavior in response to the Uki Dao complaint, despite there not even being a resolution. Yet the same thing would start to occur here. If it really was the case that these DAos are not just operators, but suddenly individual members or collectives could be liable for these things, the entire system would be upended. And I think you'd see a lot more anonymous participation. You'd see a lot more student anonymous participation, offshore participation. And I think, you know, like, you know, Gary or the CFTC is listening to this and they're like, yeah, that's what we want. I think they should really consider if that's what they actually want. Because one, you know, we've already seen what's happened in FTX when all of these things go offshore. We've already seen where individuals can organize outside of our parameters, but still introduce risks to our system. So I think, you know, some regulators, I suspect that that's, you know, somewhat their goal here is to make it so unattractive to participate in these systems or groups that they become untenable. But I think the end result won't be that they become totally untenable. It's that they become pushed to certain areas that aren't tiny. You know, yeah, we can call them niche markets, but a niche market that gets, you know, three, let's say 7% of the world's population or interest over the next ten years is a lot of people, and that's a lot of people that can impact our markets as well. So I think that's something that they also need to take into consideration when they're trying to make this type of participation so unattractive or so confusing that it essentially gets pushed to the shadows, or maybe they're confident that they can crush it all. Gary is powerful, so we'll see."

He both understands that he's not a lawyer, but also has very strong legal opinions and essentially acts on them.

And in fact, they made my suspicion partly because I know, I know a lawyer involved in the project, is that, you know, they were, they were thinking the exact opposite, that this is bullshit and it's unenforceable. So let's just say it. Get the money back and they're still going, he's still going to have criminal lives."

But again, and the reason why we keep raising this, just in case it's not clear, is that fraud, fraud funds generally have essentially like a heightened pleading standard, whether it's the government, whether it's individuals. You essentially have to prove that, like, somebody had a very specific intent when you're dealing with fraud claims. And again, it's also the case with most other criminal claims. I'm not a criminal, or so I'm not going to go farther than my limited knowledge. But suffice to say fraud claims require a very specific level of intent. And despite the fact that I think all of us, you know, think that obvious BSN online and is kind of crazy and gullible, he has been radically consistent that he genuinely believes that he did not do anything illegal. Now, that does not mean, hey, you're not a fraudster, maybe you've omitted something, but I think, you know, something like this, you know, let's argue good faith negotiation. And even his claim of saying, hey, I think something like this white hat hack bounty is not enough, and then going and negotiating a higher 1 may give them at least some challenge in saying, hey, this guy intends to take all these people's money. I mean, the guy showed up, he said it was him, negotiated with the community and signed a release. Now, I don't think that's going to absolve him of all of his criminal liability, but I do think, you know, if I'm him, I'm at least telling my lawyer, hey, you got to make some arguments about how it's very clear. I was working in good faith to get this money back. And in fact, I did get all the money back. All of the retail users ended up completely whole and I ended up with my bug bounty. Now, again, I think ultimately, from the manipulation angle, completely useless argument, like, hey, you did go out and manipulate this, but from the, hey, you intended to defraud these people. When you've got a pretty long history of saying, hey, I'm going to do this thing, collect a bug bounty, then did it and just negotiated a higher one. Again, it's not bulletproof, but I am interested to see if that ends up becoming part of his argument of saying, yeah, I posted all of this publicly because genuinely thought what I was doing was not fraud. So maybe he's got some manipulation issues that can get rid of the fraud issue, which, you know, ain't nothing. The fraud issues, you know, often the ones that you're looking at, you know, more serious criminal liability and more serious issues. So I'm interested to see if that helps."

Yeah, he posted this in early 2022. So it must have been kind of in 2021. So he talked about how they did nft sniping where the team made these bots that could just mint a ton of the hot nfts right when the project launched. And I do something with the gas price to like save themselves money because I think the way a lot of other people were doing it was trying to participate in the mint by just spamming with really high gas fees. And so because they were able to generate a ton of these mints, then, you know, the floor prices, you know, like higher right after the mint. And so it was just like easy money. And to my mind, it's like very similar to what, like ticket scalpers do. And he said that just three weeks of that netted them $2 million in profit eventually, like, other bots took over. And he wasn't able, they weren't able to do the same thing as effectively. But another thing they were doing was they were borrowing ample on aave at an interest rate of 2%. And because of the rebase, and ample, whenever that rebase was more than the 2%, then they were just profiting from that as well. And he said that they garnered $1 million in profits on $5 million of capital deployed. So those are, I would say, just more like smart trading or whatever in this. I don't know what you think of the NFT thing, like in a gray area, but all I'm trying to say is, like, those to me, don't seem so obviously illegal. And so then, and then it gets to the fortress dao thing, which Collins, you alluded to a little bit, but basically he created this project. And I may not have all the details right, but the way the project worked was that it would sunset at a certain point if the value of the FUSD reached $1. And then he kind of like mucked up the project in some way where that was just going to be the inevitable, and he would walk away with like $7 million from that. And like, all the people that had participated in that, Dow couldn't really do anything because that is how it was designed to work. So it was kind of like a rug pull where he did the minimum amount of effort and then at a certain point went kind of slack and just let it die and then profited. So you can sort of see how over time, like, he gets more and more up to the line and potentially over it again. When you're in that kind of mindset of that type of person, I think you're right that in his mind, he's justifying the mango markets thing the same way. It's just like a bit further even from kind of his original exploits. So I don't know if you have any comment on that."

And I think there are enough other interested parties that essentially just pvp'd him on the open market. That's a good example of how, again, you know, he publicly described that. Nice kafka. You know, he publicly described that, proceeded to do it.

But there are all kinds of things like dynamic interest rates. Some are governance maximized, some are governance minimized, but different mechanisms. In fact, SBF had a long post before he went to jail about the mango protocol exploit and talked about how different types of risk engine designs that perhaps respond a bit less immediately to price changes on centralized exchanges for illiquid assets can mitigate this type of attack. So, yeah, I mean, I hope that we can just continue to let people experiment and kind of maybe create some parameters around what's a socially acceptable type of attack.

Things like thresholds for deposits, things like time locking some things for a bit. It's not like you're going to get $2 billion of TVL anyway. Take the opportunity now, if you're going to launch something, to actually do so in a fairly reasonable manner and then scale up. We used to do that in 2017 or 18. It's crazy that we're looking at the IcO era for lessons, but, you know, consider it other than that, you know, thanks again, Laura. Hopefully your building is safe and not on fire right now. Good luck."
