We have aggregation, we have limit orders, we have DCA, we have perps and recently Launchpad. I think we are also the most used service on Solana and we refer about 80% of organic volume of Solana. And recently we actually recently crossed pancake and Uniswap in terms of monthly active users wallets. So I would say that we are probably if not the most used trading platform in Defi today as well. Yeah. And then our purpose platform also did 1.4 billion in volume last week. Yeah. So I think we started out being a dash aggregator, and don't get me wrong, we spent a lot of time making sure that we do the absolute best possible routing in Solana, but we also spent, I think we have also grown quite a bit into different products, including perks and our new launch pad. So I think that's a dream."

And for aggregation, because we aggregate, we promise you best price, best user experience and best token selection. That means that whatever token you want, whatever token you want is there and the best UI and the best price. And then we have limit orders and udemy orders actually really special because you can actually place limit orders. You don't need markets for limit orders. Right. And then your DCA. So DCA is actually great because DCA is by far the fan favorite."

You know, so actually originally when we did it, we were like, okay, people can use DCA to like DCH sold over one month or something, right. Every day for a month. No, no, people don't do that, right. What people do instead is that they buy very low liquidity coins and then they buy it incrementally over a few minutes or like every, every five minutes, right. You know, so that's what they do, you know. Right. And people love it, right. Because it's a feature that I think doesn't exist anywhere else."

And not just that, you're also a sucker because you imbalance the pool and then someone take your, someone up, you know, things like that or someone fundraise you many of that, right? So yeah. So you just do this here, right? You know. Yeah. So, yeah, it's really cool, I think, you know. Yeah. And of course your perks as well, virtual and our perks are probably, I think definitely top few in industry. And then if you do not consider DyDx and all the other l ones, we are probably the top around there. I think we are doing pretty well as well."

And I said, what he know of bitcoin? Is it nothing? So turns out that one of us are lying, you know. Right. So anyway, he knew everything, right? So he taught me everything. He taught me everything I knew, right. It was, it was a chance encounter, but he told me everything I knew, right. And after that, I think I went to really advise and help out in a bunch of like projects, including portfolio, you know, which obviously got bought by FTX. So I was an advisor there. And then after I went to, I went to advise projects at Instadat, which is like Kyber Kyber and bunch of others. And we also started WBTC, right, which is the most used rep token. So WTC was started as a collaboration between, like, so we did that bitgo, right? So together, Bitgo and ran, we started WTC, which is obviously the most used token today, right? Yeah. After that, at some point I think I wanted a. Because that was all if, so, before this all if, right. So I think at some point I think I wanted a new environment. And then I came to Solana. Then we started an earlier project. Then from there we became mercurial, and the mercurial became, right now it became metera. And then as part of the project, we started Jupiter. So that's how we ended up with two main projects under our studio right now."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Prepare for this one at break point last year? Right? I told everybody I want to build Launchpad, right? Because I felt that launching new tokens is such an important part of the process. It's really important. It's really, really important, right? It's like, like. But I also felt it was really. I didn't like the current models. Everything felt wrong to me. From token get the launchpads to the other ideal models. I just didn't like how they work. And then, in addition, one of the things that is very important in today's cryptocene is airdrops. It's very important because that's almost like the main event, and there hasn't really been a launch pad that integrated the idea of airdrops into the launch pad. In some sense, it's very tricky because launchpads usually have people. So we wanted to build a system that we had a problem too. In a sense. What we ended up doing was that we didn't end up trying to launch dupe, we ended up trying to build a launch pad. Because think about it, if I launch a juke token without using my launchpad, will I have any credibility to ask any other project to use Jupyter as Launchpad? Not possible, right? It's just not possible, you know? So I had to. So I had to launch Jupe using my own launch pad, right? Does any sense? And then, but then, so anyway, I was just musing, right? So I just talking the community about it, or we're just on discord, right? Because I spent a lot of time on discord, right? So I was just like, talking to discord and everything and stuff, and someone just said, hey, why don't you just launch a meme coin, right? You know, for. As a dry run for Joop, right? Because there's a lot of unknowns, right? And I was like, okay, that's a really fucking stupid idea, you know? Right. But then obviously me being me, if it's a stupid idea, go test it, right? So I went on Twitter and be like, hey, someone suggested that we launch a test coin for. To test the launch pad. To test the launch. Just like how, you know, how Elon launch test rockets, you know?"

It's much more lower stakes in much lower stakes because the token is obviously much less value. But what we can also do is that we can also technically stress test it. That means that we can actually. So for Jup, the number of Jup number of recipients is at. So for this, for the wan token, we add up to more than a million, 1.1 million or something. So in many ways it was just as technically stressful. It requires us to really scale rpcs, really scale up our PCs. We scale infra and really get the UI right and everything, but in a much lower state context. Yeah. So that was the point of it, you know, obviously. Obviously it was something fun as well."

    },

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So in a moment, we'll talk more about how the launch went. But first, a quick word for the sponsors who make the show possible. Did you know you can buy and sell crypto with tax benefits in an individual retirement account? Itrustcapital makes this possible. But what does this mean? When you buy crypto outside an IRA, like on an exchange, you face taxes on gains. But in an IRA, like a Roth IRA, gains can be tax free. Itrustcapital also has some of the lowest fees in the industry and 24/7 accessibility. Start now and maximize your retirement savings with itrust capital. Back to my conversation with meow. So, as the day of your airdrop, the crypto community did seem impressed that nothing broke. But as I'm sure you saw then, there was a lot of criticism afterward about how people seem to think that the airdrop was beneficial to the Jupiter team. So some examples are people are pointing out that the Jupiter team sold about maybe 20% of the circulating supply from day one at what they consider a high valuation. The way that this worked is they're saying that the Juber team provided liquidity in a liquidity pool on the dynamic liquidity market maker meteora. But pretty much for at least that first hour, the liquidity pool was basically just Jupiter selling to buyers. And that, you know, the price that you guys had set was that it would reach about $0.70 as the number of tokens sold reached 250 million. And, you know, they were pointing out that you guys made this money without any vesting. So what do you say to these criticisms?"

It's not a fundraising pool, first and foremost, okay. It's not a fundraising pool, first and foremost, okay. It's first and foremost a liquidity bootstrap and backstop pool. Okay? Let me explain to you."

And thirdly, and secondly, and you must understand one thing, Laura, you must really understand this thing, there is an extremely good chance that I don't actually get any money out of this USDC, out of this at all, okay? Because first and foremost, this is a backstop pool. Now, what does that mean? It means that anyone, whether you're airdrop recipient, okay, or someone with buying remorse, right, you can just dump to this pool for seven days. Seven days, okay.

It means that at any point in time, right, the juke token falls below 0.4 for the cents, right? We get nothing, first off, right, we get the pool. That's it. So we get tokens back, right?

Jup research. Jup. R E a R ch. Okay, check it out, right? For really check it out. We documented. We documented the whole. Because we treat Jup as a very valuable resource, okay? So we documented every single step of the token minting accountability. For example, all our co wallets, we can't actually sign or release it. Why? Because we actually got professional custodians and three ecosystem people, well known people, such that if you want to unlock the cold wallet stuff, they have to sign in. And then we are very, very close to finding the professional custodian for that. So I think we build a community up the user base up the product up for this to be a very valuable token. First and foremost, it's not our thin air, okay? That's very important. Okay? If it's our thin air, why don't they do it, right? Think about it, right? If it's our thin air, why don't they do it? No, seriously, seriously, Laura, work with me, okay? Work with me. Okay? If it's really out of thin air, right, why don't they do it right and make it and set it at this price and let people buy it? No, it's not out of thin air, all right? It's not. It's the manifestation of the years and years of commitment, effort, commune to the ecosystem and community building. Ecosystem building. And that resulted in the token that people wanted to buy. As a result, that took at value. And we were very careful of protecting value. We locked everything up properly, had everything in wallets that committee can track, and we took a small piece of that out of our sale. And remember, there's no more bastic. That's 5% for mercurial and 20% for team, but there's no other, there's nothing else. Okay. So we were very, very careful how to use it. Okay. That's it. That's all I'll say, you know. Yeah."

And I guess on there, the swap fee that liquidity providers earn consists of both a base fee and a variable fee. And the variable fee is based on real time volatility. And they're saying that this dynamic, where the sales are mostly just all happening in one direction, created a lot more volatility, which then jacked up that fee that you would earn.

Our first launch literally happened less than a week ago. By the way, guys, just for some context, the wan launch happened four days before the Jupyter launch. Four days. Yes. We do things on the fly for sure. We learned a lot for the, when the fees were high, but the pool was relatively small, like 3 million. So it just flew through really fast. So we didn't really pay attention. We didn't really think about that much for the juke one, it went really slowly and we would see that. No, so they're right. So 100% right."

Anyway, guys, I think if anyone is trying to, but if you are asking that question out of good intention, right. They are saying, oh, you can probably improve the system by doing a feast. 100% agree. No problem. But if you are insuating you are doing it for the money, then I think our track record speaks for itself. We spend a very, very long time. I personally did a lot of projects for no money. Then we spend a lot of time in Solana making our money at all. Just working our ass off. I feel like we are very clean here in terms of how we think about it, you know? So I think so in summary, 100% for future launchers, the pool fee will be much lower."

So if you look at my tweets right now, this is very important. Okay? This is very important. I've always said that we're experimenting, and we will mess up. Okay. And all mess up. If we mess up, it's my fault. Okay. Done. So I own it. Okay. I own that the fees are too high. I own that the number of the systems that people wanted to use to buy the token that this year didn't work that well. You know, I also, I mean, also own that. I also own that some of the comms were not done as well. Because, for example, earlier, right. It's like, to me, it was so clear what it was that when I communicated it, I communicated, okay, it's a DLMM backstop. It's team owned DLMM backstop liquidity pool. So it was hard for me to register that people might not understand that. So I apologize for that. But anyway, I think, I'll tell you, I mess up a lot. And I learned that's how it works. But now I think. But the good thing is this. After we do joke, the good thing is this. Everyone, now, every project that uses, they will have this problem.

But then shortly before the airdrop, I guess that got changed. So it was 250. No, no, but. But I saw a screenshot of before. The plan was it would be 500 million sold for it to reach that price. But then it got changed to 250 million sold for it to reach that price. So basically, you know, you guys were selling at a. At this higher price faster. So why? Why did you make that change?"

By the way he built a tool to allow anybody to input a few parameters and output the graph and output the price raise and everything. So what we were doing is that we were actually very, very actively trying to figure out what the good system was. And we actually made a decision a day before. You know, again, we do things on the week. We are quite experimental. Okay. We finished the. When. We finished the when thing, uh, last week. Uh, last week. And then we started, uh, we started.

So basically, it was a matter of, like, you know, us, like, looking through numbers and thinking about it, you know, I would say, if I do it again, I would say that I was a bit too aggressive on the pricing, the low to high price. And the reason. Okay, here's a funny thing. Here's a funny thing. Do you know, basically what happened is that in earlier launchers, I think we were very heavily criticized. The one thing to understand about the whole, for the listeners who are not too familiar with LFG, the core concept here is open market. That means that whether you're airdrop or you are bought or the DRM pool, it opens at the same time. It's a very dynamic open market system. Okay?

So basically, what happened was what happened ended up is that the max price ended up being the price, and then the initial price started being a bit high as well. It's actually because you wanted to protect against, like, no bottles being too aggressive early on, you know, but I guess we got a bit carried by that. Right.

And also, the other thing is that this system also allows buyers their confidence because having this pool here, Laura, remember, we are actually airdropping a lot of value. At current numbers, it's like 600 plus million value. That means that you need a lot by demand. So buyers need a lot of confidence. Okay. And then what happens is that, like, what happens is someone. So if the price starts fluctuating like crazy, right. The buyers have no commit to Dubai, you know? But what this, what this pool actually does is that it absorbs a lot of the sell demand."

And honestly, I think it worked as planned. It really worked as planned. So I'm really happy about that. But I feel like instead of trying to understand the mechanics, I feel like people were not interested in understanding mechanics, but they were really interested in sender. And that made me very upset because we really, really spent a lot of time thinking about how to build a better launch pad. I think we're not perfect, but I think we made progress, you know, into doing so. Yeah. So. So anyway, I apologize if I came across as, like, being very annoyed, you know, but it has been an extremely stressful few months. And then to finish off that with, like, a lot of thought and just unfounded for, for, no, get me wrong, certain things I did wrongly. Okay. I think I was very technical in how I described the pool firstly. Okay. I apologize for that. Okay. And I assume a lot of context because I've been saying that things in my discord and livestream for a long time. So I apologize for that. Secondly.

Because you have an asset, but there's no market, that's pointless. So what you need is markets. And then what Jupyter does is that Jupyter does a really good job of just bringing all those markets together and allowing you to transact across that one transaction. Basically what I want to do is I want to personally really drive to help a lot of the companies bring more assets like Forex and everything into the network and working with Cumberland and other guys, because if that happens, then you can literally go from a privativity market asset to a meme coin. And you can do those users to pay for your PayPal, something. I think the goal is to bring as many of the market as possible into one network, which is Solana.

In a major turn of events, FTX, the giant cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, informed a bankruptcy judge that it will not be reviving operations. This frees FTX to commit to fully repaying its customers. The failure to restart the exchange underscores how weak its infrastructure was that it could not find a partner willing to put in the money and effort to build upon the remains of what was once the third largest crypto exchange by volume. This move is expected to bring some relief to the numerous customers affected by FTX's collapse. But pegging the value of customer accounts to the date FTX filed for relief left customers complaining that a collapsing FTX drove prices down for nine days before it sought protection. Also this week, the FTX estate told Bloomberg that it had doubled the entity's cash reserves to $4.4 billion from the 2.3 billion in October. Meanwhile, a judge authorized the sale of FTX's Bahamas properties, including Sam Bankman Fried's $40 million penthouse, as part of the exchanges bankruptcy proceedings. Lastly, in related news, effective Ventures foundation agreed to return about $26.8 million in donations received from FTX. Celsius Network, the cryptocurrency lending platform co founded by Alex Mashinsky that was under chapter eleven protection has commenced the distribution of over $3 billion in assets to its creditors as part of its reorganization. This crucial step, confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, coincides with the emergence of Celsius from bankruptcy. In addition to the distribution, Celsius creditors are now the owners of a new bitcoin mining company, Ionic Digital Inc. Created by Celsius with mining operations managed by Hut eight Tether Holdings Limited, the entity behind the popular stablecoin, Tether, reported an unprecedented financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023. The firm's net profit soared to $2.85 billion, a notable milestone in its operational history. This achievement was largely driven by substantial earnings from US treasury securities, contributing approximately $1 billion to the net operating profits. The remainder of the profits primarily stemmed from the appreciation of the company's bitcoin and gold reserves. The quarter also witnessed remarkable growth in tethers excess reserves, which climbed by $2.2 billion, reaching a total of over $5.4 billion. These excess reserves are crucial in covering the firm's outstanding unsecured loans, which stood at $4.8 billion at the year's end, thereby addressing past community concerns about potential risks associated with this aspect of tethers portfolio. For the entire year of 2023, Tether declared a net profit of $6.2 billion. This financial strength was attributed to various sources, including $4 billion from US treasury bonds and other non crypto investments. The firm's total assets under management included significant holdings in US Treasuries, bitcoin, gold and venture capital investments. Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis reached a settlement agreement with the SEC regarding a civil lawsuit, Bloomberg reported Thursday afternoon. This lawsuit accused Genesis of violating securities regulations through its Gemini earn program. Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital currency Group, has agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty to resolve these allegations. However, the payment of this penalty is contingent on the company's ability to fully repay its customers and other creditors in its chapter eleven bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement, pending approval by a bankruptcy judge, addresses claims that Genesis illegally raised funds from investors via the Gemini earn program. This program, operated in collaboration with Gemini Trust Company, offered interest payments to customers for loaning their digital assets. The SEC had argued that this constituted an offering of unregistered securities. Both Genesis and Gemini have denied any wrongdoing, asserting that the earn program was not a security the program has been terminated since then. German police executed one of their largest cryptocurrency seizures, confiscating over \u20ac2.1 billion worth of bitcoin. This operation focused on dismantling an illegal covert streaming service. The seizure at the scale was a major blow to digital piracy networks leveraging cryptocurrencies. Concurrently. In the UK, the police made a significant seizure of nearly 1.8 billion pounds in bitcoin linked to an investment fraud scheme originating in China. This operation was part of a broader investigation that stretched across international borders, highlighting the increased global efforts to track and seize digital assets connected to criminal activities. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by volume, now permits larger traders to store assets with two external banks, possibly due to concerns arising from its recent $4.3 billion us regulatory fine. This operational change comes as high volume traders increasingly seek platforms with robust security and stability in a dynamic regulatory environment. Binance has entered into partnerships with Signumbank and Flowbank to custody these assets. These collaborations are geared towards enhancing the access and management of cryptocurrencies for users. Signum bank specializes in digital asset banking, while flow bank operates as an online bank in Switzerland. On Wednesday, Ripple suffered a significant security breach, with co founder Chris Larsen confirming that his personal accounts were exploited. The hackers stole approximately $113 million. Larson's acknowledgement of the unauthorized transfers has brought attention to the security vulnerabilities even high profile individuals in the crypto industries can face. Abracadabra money, a decentralized platform, suffered an exploit. This security breach led to the destabilization of magic Internet money, causing it to lose its peg to the us dollar. The exploit was executed through a series of complex transactions that manipulated the price of the collateral in the Ethereum cauldrons, ultimately leading to the unauthorized withdrawal of funds. The immediate impact of this incident was a noticeable de pegging of the MIM token from its intended one to one parity with the us dollar. MIM went as low as 0.76 before it rebounded to 0.98. Polygon Labs, the development team behind the Polygon blockchain, announced a reduction of its workforce by 19% following a period of rapid expansion during the last cryptocurrency bull run. The layoffs come as the company adjusts to the current market climate and refocuses its strategy for sustainable growth. This decision reflects a broader trend in the tech and crypto industries, where companies are reassessing their growth strategies and workforce needs in response to the changing market conditions. For instance, this week fintech giant PayPal fired nearly 2500 employees for the remaining employees of Polygon Labs. There was good news, however. Polygon concurrently announced that it was giving employees company wide a 15% raise and eliminating geographic differences in pay. And that's all. Thanks so much for joining us today.
