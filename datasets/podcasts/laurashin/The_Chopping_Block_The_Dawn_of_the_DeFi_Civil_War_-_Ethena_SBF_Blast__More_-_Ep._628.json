Boys, we got another week of the crypto bull market. Today was notable, and we'll be talking about this a lot today. It was the launch of a token called Athena, which we've talked about on the show previously. I think we had a bit of a snip back and forth about it. Dragonfly. We are big investors in Athena. We led their seed round. We also invested a ton of their series A, so we own a lot of this token. Token has come out at a crazy high price. For those of you who are not in the know, you may have seen Arthur Hayes going out talking about how amazing Athena is. Athena has grown to, what are they sitting like? 1.5 billion of the token circulating, or, sorry, of the stable coin that's circulating valuation?"

So although its token has launched today, there's a big fight taking place in Defi that is being called a defi civil war over Athena. So let's talk a little bit about what's going on. There's a lot of details here about what's exactly happening, and so I thought, Robert, you might be the best person to kind of parse and explain the story. So it starts with makerdao integrating Athena, and we talked a little bit about this last time, and now it's extending into Ave having a response to what's happening at maker. So, Robert, can you walk us through what happened exactly with Athena?"

        "text": "Okay, so, Athena. Athena. The simplest way to understand Athena is that it's a tokenized cash and carry trade. The idea is you take ether, you hold ether on spot, and then you short the futures or the perpetual swaps. This is known as a cash and carry trade, basically means you're delta neutral. So you're, in theory, not taking price risk, you're only taking counterparty risk. There's obviously a couple of other risks that are in the interim of where you find liquidity and how you balance across different markets. But more or less, that's the idea. It's a tokenized cash and carry trade. So you can deposit, instead of holding ether, they hold stake ether, and so they give the cash and carry trade yield, as well as the staked ether yield. And some of this yield goes into an insurance pool. But that's more or less how it works. It's a token. You can buy it to essentially get the yield from that tokenized cash and carry trade."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Okay, so given that there's a synthetic dollar, not a stable coin, as some would say, that Athena created what they've done is they've been incentivizing people to mint, hold, and defi these USD tokens in various different DeFi protocols. So there have been a couple major, like, early incentives that ran for the first airdrop campaign, including curve, pendle, morpho, gearbox, things like this. And it was incredibly successful. So what people did was they minted tons of USD, they used it in these respective protocols, and they got points, shards, tokens, whatever you want to call them, in Athena's airdrop. And they were heavily incentivized to use these friendly peer DeFi protocols because they super juiced the incentives to use these protocols. So if you used curve, you got like 15 times as many tokens as if you just held USD. So what's happened today is they airdropped the token. Everybody. The Internet celebrated. And then they began season two, so to speak, of their airdrop campaign. And Makerdao as a part of this, you know, like all of the 36 hours ago or 24 hours ago at this point, announced that they were going to be massively increasing the use of Uste and staked USD in Morfo to borrow Dai. And I. I'll unpack the exact mechanics here for anyone who's already confused, because there's too many things flying across. But Morpho allows different teams to create white labeled single asset borrowing pools. And so Makerdao has these borrowing pools that they've created where users can use USDe as collateral, where s USD is collateral and borrow daiden. The Makerdao ecosystem Dao protocol mints those Dai for users to borrow. So they're basically acting like a central bank or a commercial bank when they're doing lending, which increases the money supply. Makerdao is minting new Dai for people to borrow through Morpho. So it's collateralized by people's Athena assets. And Makerdao's letting people borrow dai indirectly through Morpho. And over the last couple of days, this was very successful. There was an upper bound of $100 million of dai that could be borrowed because of the incentives that Athena laid out. This flew off the shelves. Everybody pumped as much Athena coins as they could into Morpho, borrowed. All the die out. And interest rates in Morpho have been like anywhere from like 30% to 80% to borrow dai. If youre Makerdao, this is a wonderful thing. People are literally paying maker Dow 80% to borrow dai collateralized by a synthetic dollar, which is generally pretty stable. And so for Makerdao, this has been so far, its a very short period of time, theres a lot of risks. Its hard to say whether its sustainable all these things. Dot, dot, dot. Makerdao has benefited tremendously from this, and it looks like an incredible new revenue stream for Makerdao. And so Makerdao put out a proposal today to raise the limit to a billion dollars, starting with only $600 million of actual DAI issuance, but allowing there to be a billion dollars of Dai minted for people to borrow using Athena synthetic dollar collateral. And this immediately set off a lot of debate on the Internet. There's a lot of folks who were pro Makerdao on this. They think it's like the greatest thing for Makerdao possible. If people are going to borrow a billion dollars from Makerdao at 30% to 80% interest rates, Makerdao is going to make a lot of money. And then there's a counter reaction from other protocols that feel left out or feel, you know, neglected or it's hard to describe, but, you know, this immediately set off a chain reaction, specifically with the Aave protocol that began the process to delist die, citing the fact that they believe that Dai, because of this billion dollar mint, was too risky for Ave to support as collateral, as well as the announced interest in delisting the asset entirely. And so this is a huge event to occur in the span of a day. Crypto, Twitter has been abuzz talking about what this means, why it's happening, where everyone goes from here, and it's setting off fireworks. And so we'd love to hear from you all. What do you think of these fireworks?"

        "text": "Yeah, I mean, sure, I think there was a very frank discussion, and I think the Makerdao forums actually a pretty good recap of the risks involved with Athena that have been, I think, discussed ad nauseam at this point. I think the point that I think Mark Zeller from Aave was making, too, is more around kind of the way in which this happened and the speed. It's one thing to add a new collateral type that is maybe a different risk profile than other types of collateral, but it's the fact that it's happening so quickly and also, I mean, this happened right after the huge maker interest rate hike, and so feels like maker is moving very quickly. And I think Aave feels, hey, maybe there's more risk accruing here than we're comfortable underwriting. I do think there's also probably this, like, additional subtext of, you know, Aave is obviously also trying to get go its own stablecoin off the ground and bigger and so effectively sort of subsidizing dai on AAve through the merit program is sort of counterproductive to the growth of go. And then obviously, there's this other sort of subtext here, which is like, gauntlet obviously recently broke up with Aave, but then Gauntlet also has pools on morphoglu, different product, and sort of a different, you know, not exactly directly competitive, but, like, it feels like there's sort of different factions of the Defi ecosystem right now taking a different line, a different sort of perspective on what's happening."

Maybe. Maybe can. Can say somewhat more, uh, things on the aave side, I would say that it's kind of irrational to be like, we're going to remove all of Dai, while also listing SUSD, amongst other thing. Like, there's. There's a whole. They're sus e. Sorry. Uh, it's so. It's like, there's definitely a lot of beef between Ave and Morpho. I think it's. The french defi community seems to have no ability to have any pleasantries with each other. They all just are, like, fucking have daggers out to stab each other, every single one of them. That's my historical interactions with that entire french defi community somehow is. There's. There's a lot of beef. There's just a lot of. I don't. I don't know exactly why it is. It seems very unique to them. If I were to write an anthropology of Defi, I think they would get a chapter. If it was like Les Mis, where there's, like, a chapter for, like, every little subculture involved, they could. They definitely get their own. So there's a lot of beef there. If you look at the merit program that was mentioned, it purposely singles out Morpho and Spark, which is sort of a makerdao subdao, which was an aave fork. There's been a lot of beef in the forums between maker and Aave for a while. Obviously, go has had tremendous problems with its peg. So, like, you know, there's always been some kind of people feeling bad about that. But I would say there's the beef aspect, the personal beef aspect is actually the thing shining through here, not some rational risk making procedure. And that personally, you think the riskiness."

Now, obviously, the LTV liquidation threshold difference is something worth keeping in mind, but not worth bringing up on the show. But the idea that it's somehow worth going to zero, but you're listening to the same thing and doing. There's a lot of inconsistencies. It's certainly not coming from a rigorous sense. And, you know, I would not necessarily say the counterpart involved as being particularly rational in Zeller, but, you know, not that that's been historically forever, but I would say that, yeah, like, sure, there is definitely increased risk. If you're like, there's a systematically lowering LTV in some manner that's consistent with how much you're increasing it with SVSD, you would make much more sense than doing the zero, the removing it from merit. So merit is the thing, again, to ensure that no TVL goes to Morpho, there's a bunch of extra protocol rewards that get paid to users who don't use other lending protocols. And I would say that, yeah, don't underestimate how much beef can be a driver of these things, regardless of how much people sugarcoat their public writings."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I would say, Tarun, you're being surprisingly subtle in your responses here, but I guess, let me say a couple of things that this whole situation has made me think. So. One is that with respect to Makerdao, this is what many people have always wanted Makerdao to start doing, which is take advantage of the fact that you are the central bank of crypto, and that should afford you the right to monetize the fact that you're the central bank of crypto, especially in a bull market. And this is what that looks like, which is, look, we have the ability to basically be the most trusted collateral anywhere in the world, and we can effectively transform low quality collateral into high quality collateral. Not everybody is ready to take a synthetic dollar as a form of payment or whatever, but if you can basically put that down as collateral and borrow dai, amazing. That is basically transforming less liquid, less accepted collateral into more liquid, more accepted collateral. And you should get paid for that. And that's what maker is doing. They're saying, how much can I get paid? Oh, wow. I can get paid 60% annualized and get points and get this and get that. Awesome. I'm going to go do that. So I think that's part of the reason why on a day when the market is actually down across the board, maker's up. Despite the fact that today is the day that this civil war, quote, unquote, has begun, and Avi's talking about delisting maker, it's not the principal reason why maker is maker. So that's one thing, is I think it's a step in the right direction for Maker. Now, we talked last time about the whole end game plan and all the other stuff that they're doing, which, whatever the market seems to enjoy the direction that maker is taking on that side, but just on the pure fundamentals of being more aggressive on interest rates and being more opportunistic. Right. The idea for makerdao is that the only reason why you should be taking more risk is if there's commensurate reward. And in this case, like you said, Robert, making 60% annualized, that's a pretty great reward. That sounds like worth taking some instrumental or some, some incremental idiosyncratic risk."

I don't know how you want to call it, but let's say verticalized is they basically launched many different applications within the same brand. And everyone was kind of wondering, I remember we were talking about at that time of like, oh, why isn't uniswap doing this? Why aren't other people launching a bunch of stuff? And eventually they did, but many, many years later. And I think in the early days of Defi, there was this kind of kumbaya energy that people kind of assumed like, oh, we're all part of the same movement, everything's open source, we're all going to be friends. And we're now seeing, look, when you do verticalize and you decide like, hey, you know what, Facebook's going to have an identity solution, but Google's also going to have one. And then we're going to have a marketplace. But you're also going to have a marketplace. We're going to have a mapping service, but so is apple. And you start realizing that actually we are now competing in more and more dimensions and this patina of, oh, we're all friends and we're all in it for the love and whatever. It's all positive sum.

Otherwise you wouldn't even try doing it. They're like, oh, it's going to be easy to just expand to this and create the same market share, create the same effect. And like, that's just not. These things are all, they have microstructure nuances, they have market participant nuances, they have math nuances. And I think if you maybe didn't, you got market share for all the reasons that weren't the subset, and then you move to another thing where all the market share comes from exactly the reasons you're bad at or the things you're not good at. You may set yourself up expectation wise in a way that doesn't work. I feel like it does. Remind me a little bit about the early. No, no, I'm just giving a general, I gave you a general statement about arbitrary, arbitrary sector growth, not necessarily any particular products that are being named. I just am pointing out that there's this kind of expectation mismatch that happens, and it reminds me a little bit, although maybe the stakes are a lot lower, not a lot lower, but definitely lower, of the early social network days, when it was like, everyone and their mom, who had a random tech company would, like, either quit and start a social network, or it was like Google tried to make. Remember that abhorrent circles thing? They made that social network no one used? There was kind of this same Google Plus. Google. Right, right. That was. I just remember the circles, Google. But there was this whole thing, whereas all these people were like, oh, Facebook had this success, we're going to try to get into it. And then, like, all of them. Like, none of them were able to meet their expectations. And I will say one of the things that you have to give Zach Gelato credit for is he's one of the few people who can actually say he expanded into new verticals within social and kept his market share at the same amount, which is astonishing. That's extremely hard to do, and I think in crypto, that's even way harder to do because the barriers to entry are so much lower in terms of building a network effect or losing a network effect."

And ultimately, for a defi central bank, that's the number one. The number one thing that matters, that people trust you. And I think, look, I do agree directionally with some of the concerns of saying, hey, this is kind of a big growth in the total exposure to Athena, and maybe they should have tempered it a little bit more, gone a little bit slower, maybe even in absolute terms. I think if you read the governance thread, I think they make a good point. They're like, look, the risk of loss is actually pretty low. And if you model out how much you lose, this is not going to be 100% wipeout situation. This is like, oh, maybe 20%, 15%. And so there's a lot of situations where actually, the risk level for the reward you're getting is pretty reasonable. But I think the optics of it matter just as much as the reality of it matters. And so, optically, I think maybe they should have been able to foresee that, hey, this would have caused people to be a bit jumpy, especially after the sudden rake hike.

There's a great kind of very magical moment where the SPFs mother, who, those of you maybe read some of the books, you might recall his mother is a philosopher who was, I guess, famous at Stanford for her endorsement of utilitarianism, which surprised repeaters prominently in the story of SPF. She wrote in a note to the judge, which was roundly criticized by many people. She wrote that SPF never intended to commit harm and that he was an awkward math nerd who loved video game and animals, so tried to portray him as being a very altruistic person. It talked about how the fact that he was still vegan in prison, which shows his moral commitment, and he lost 30 pounds and didn't even complain to any of the prison guards about losing weight. So this didn't fly particularly well with the judge. The judge in sentencing said Sam never showed a word of remorse. He knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught. There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something really bad in the future. And it's not a trivial risk. The judgment has to accurately reflect the seriousness of the crime, and this was a very serious crime. So he says that the 105 years that were recommended by the probation department and by the prosecutor, 40, 50 years, was more than necessary. He says the judge continued, I'm not diminishing the harm, the brazenness of his actions, his exceptional flexibility with the truth, his apparent lack of any remorse. I want to add one further thought. I did not think it a fruitful use of time to spell out every lie. When not lying, he was evasive, hairsplitting, trying to get the prosecutors to rephrase questions for him. I've been doing this job for close to 30 years. I've never seen a performance like that. He ended up sentencing SPF to 25 years in prison because it is a federal sentence. The overwhelming likelihood you'll serve at least 80% of that time. So almost certainly at least 20 years that he'll be serving in prison, assuming that there's, there's no appeal. So what are you guys thoughts on the sentence as we're finally kind of at the end of the line? Just for comparison, for those sentences, for white collar crimes? So I believe. Shoot. Who's the Ponzi skin guy?"

Everyone who I know who works at anthropic EA sympathizer thinks it was too harsh and should have been five years. And the funny thing is, the average of the two, like, if I average the two estimates and comes out to the 25, so that's just my sort of statistical thing that says, like, hey, it seems like it's fair. Like, if you sample enough people, it seems as a bimodal distribution where the people who. Who put 25 are the ones who just don't care that much, and the people who, like, care. But think about all the defenses, arguments, think it's five, and everyone else thinks it's, like, 45 or 50. I don't know. I found that kind of a weird idiosyncrasy that I observed. But I agree with the judge. I mean, I also think how this is, like, the. One of the most erratic court performances in history. I feel like we got some. We should all feel a little bit thankful that we got both performance art and a court judgment at the same time. You don't get that very often because, yeah, Sam had no, literally no remorse. I remember reading the testimony during sentencing, and he didn't say sorry once. He didn't even really say, like, oh, I lost. Just kind of like, I made a bad bet. He kept saying that I'm like, the one time you probably should learn how to just say sorry. You know? It's like, you know, it's like, I remember all those memes right after FTX came out, which would, like, deepfakes of him saying, I'm sorry. And it's like, yeah, they're all deepfakes.

Obviously, the civil charges against him by the SEC are also going to be, would otherwise be significant if had they decided to go through with him, which I assume they're not, given that he's going to be in prison. But it just feels like on top of all of that, locking somebody in a cage for 25 years and he'll be 50 when he gets out. I don't know. I don't believe in retributive justice or punitive justice in that kind of way, that just kind of locking away somebody and then feeding them through the state. And now he's on all of our dime now because he can't do anything. He can't be productive. He can't make any rights wrong, make any wrongs right. He's just kind of useless. But he still lives on in prison for the next 20 years. And I just kind of feel like. I don't know that. I don't know that it matters so much that the recovery, whatever Solana went up and anthropic turned out to be a good bet and blah, blah, blah, whatever. I sort of don't take that into too much consideration, although I think it matters somewhat. But it is a kind of moral luck, essentially, of whether or not your crazy Vegas bets turned out to win or lose. But it does seem like it should matter to some degree when you look at the comps of. It's the most vc possible thing to say.

Shkreli was talking about this about how there's almost no way that he could get below 20 years just because of sentencing guidelines. Which are more or less mandatory. If they give him less than that, I think he can get appealed or something. So, yeah, it does seem like there's no way that Sam was going to get any better than at least 20 years. So 25 years seems like probably middle of the road for what you would expect for Sam to get.

And, like, literally, if you are. If you are in San Quentin prison, you cannot get unfettered Internet access. What we had to do is we had to download an offline version of GitHub so that people could have access to, like, actual code that they could interact with and search through in order to learn how to code like it. Prison is just this horrific, stultifying environment for people that I just think the way the US does prison is insane, and I think it's horrible for people, and we pay for it with tax anyway, whatever. All right, I'm not going to rant. Let's move on. Last story, which I think is interesting, speaking of prison, there was a hack that took place last week on blast, and this hack was speculated perhaps to have been done by North Korea, which, of course, has been an active attack. Pretty good guess by protocols. Pretty good guess. There's some reason to think that perhaps what happened there was this protocol called munchables. I don't know. Maybe protocol is a strong word. There was an application called munchables on blast. There were smart contracts. There were smart contracts. Okay, even better, let's upgrade. That's. You could send your money to a place, to a multisig under the name of Munchables. And apparently they hired a developer who may have been a sleeper agent, sort of fake developer who was actually a plan from North Korea. Now, there's speculation. We don't know whether or not this would happen. But Zack XBT, who's a well known on chain sleuth, was speculating this may have been what took place for this thing called munchables. There's a $62 million that was basically hacked, and that was floating around blast and everyone. It was kind of a code red moment. Now, all ended well. The money was returned, and ultimately everybody, presumably, was made whole, and the attackers did not get away with it. And it's speculated this may be because blast, of course, right now their bridge is relatively centralized. It's not fully automated quite yet, because, of course, if you remember, blast has this native yield. You deposit ether, they put it into Lido, and there's all this fanciness that's going on in the backend. It was possible, in principle, for them to be able to block withdrawals from the bridge or even do a rollback of the layer two in order to undo the hack. And there was a big debate taking place online, which, thankfully, never actually got down to the wire. But there was this big debate on whether or not blasts should, in principle, roll back the chain and or prevent withdrawals in order to stop this north korean hacker from divesting their 62 million that they stole. And so this led to a big online mudslinging conversation. Didn't end up mattering, or at least ostensibly, we didn't end up having to have that conversation, although maybe it was pulled as a negotiating card with the attacker. We don't know. But I wanted to ask the question because the Twitter conversation stopped. But I don't think I thought it was so fascinating that I wanted to hear your guys take on this question. Let's say we rewind the clock back about a week. In the middle of the hack should blast."

It is not at all a decentralized l two yet. One of the advantages of that is that while under complete centralized control, they can make changes, especially changes that are in the best interest of the users. And I think it just starts with a very simple question. Would a rollback be in the best interest of the users, or would blocking the attackers funds and then redistributing back to the users be in the best interest of the users? The answer is yes. It seems very obvious to me. The only downside, the only argument against it, is one in which the public at large would say, oh, but bless is completely centralized. Like, yes, they are. Like, all the arguments I saw for why they shouldn't do that, it was like, you know, oh, this just proves that blessed is, like, not a true l two or like, it just proves that, like, it doesn't matter. Like, this isn't Ethereum. Back in the day when they had to make the hard decision to fork and move past the Dow like the original, like, hard fork decision. Like, Ethereum and Blast are radically different platforms and radically different systems, and one was designed to be decentralized, and one was not designed to be decentralized. So why even try to map the analogy to historical patterns like the DAO and just try to embrace the features of what it is?"

And it's going to be a long time before this thing is fully decentralized. And if we do this one, we are weighing in on something that we don't know the answer to, of who exactly is these attacker, and blah, blah, blah. But second is that it's setting a. It's setting. It's also implicitly giving us liability, because if we are blocking this attack, what about all the attacks that we don't block? What about all the little tiny hacks that people will then come and say, hey, you blocked the north korean attack, but you didn't block my hack of, like, a million dollars or $2 million. Are. Are you now liable to block every attack? And if not, like, is it wise to be creating this precedent that, look, if your protocol gets hacked, like, you as a user, you're responsible for making sure that you don't put your money into random devs who are doing whatever random nonsense. If the protocol is intentionally going out compromising its own, not the values that currently are in constant. The protocol yet, because they're not. But that's the protocol that we're aspiring to be, is one that is fully decentralized and where we don't have this escape hatch that we can pull anytime we want to, I don't think blast is a kind of moral hazard."

Binance and BSC, whenever there was issues they could block, whenever there was hacks they could unhack, whenever there was stolen funds they could unsteal. Did it? Did they get it right 100% of the time? No. I'm sure there's all sorts of, like, heinous crimes on finance, smart chain and hacks that they didn't fix, but whenever they had an opportunity to fix a large hack, they did it. And the user base, on the whole, was incredibly happy that they did, and legitimately, pineapple smart chain is probably more decentralized and probably a more robust system than blast is, and they still did everything in their power to prevent users from being screwed over. That was one of the biggest selling points for a very long time of binance smart chain, which was the worst landmines. They were able to, like, fix the damage from and prevent users from getting royally screwed in the name of, like, aspirational decentralization. And so I think it's a good model when done correctly, and I think if you set the expectations correctly, everybody's happy."

But I think the differences with BNB chain BSD you had say what you want about the legality of binance, but arguably binance has so much hold over its users because it's actually like they like the platform and they trust it to do certain things.

It's literally just. They dump the call data on chain. And so if you don't want to have this onus on you, then you have to find a way to throw away the keys and make sure that there is no onus, that you can't possibly do a rollback, that the whole thing just sort of functions without you. And I think until you're at that point, there is that obligation."

I think you described it well as, like, having the button. Um, the button is there, like, the reason why we have these admin keys is for bugs. Uh, for, like, you know, things that. Some coding error that ends up actually affecting the protocol. Having $62 million stolen by North Korea is just as bad as any other bug that might get introduced at a protocol level. So if you want to save your ass and also save, like, crypto, more or less, it's kind of on you to help do the good work of making sure that North Korea can't monetize these attacks. And so I think the answer just really, really easy is that, yes, it does open a can of worms, and that can of worms is going to get opened anyway because you don't have fraud proofs and you're not kind of fully decentralized yet. And that's true for most of the optimistic roll ups today, is that, you know, they're not all the way. What is it, level two or level three roll ups? I forget what the level is. They're not all the way to the higher levels of roll up ness. In which case, like, yeah, you kind of have to accept that you're not there, and, you know, there's no. There's no point in playing make believe. Like, just do the right thing, and that probably means, you know, block the bridge or, you know, in the worst case, roll back the chain. I'm very against rollbacks. I think they're just, like, incredibly messy and defy is so complicated now that, like, literally rolling back is just borderline impossible. Like, you're going to undo too many things. Yeah, but. But blocking the bridge. I mean, the fact that there's no privacy pools or anything on blast should make it, I think, relatively straightforward.
