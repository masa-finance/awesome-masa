He gives us his crypto theses for 2024. This is from a document that he publishes every year, where he goes through. I think this one is 200 pages of all of his predictions, all of the themes, all of the narratives, all of the things he thinks will be in store for us in the following year. A few things we talk about in today's episode. The big investment themes in 2024, including bitcoin, ethereum, and all the other tokens down the market stack. Also the people to watch, including Larry Fink. Ryan thinks he is about to get a lot more bullish on crypto, how we defeat Elizabeth Warren as well. We talk about that and why Ryan thinks Barry Silbert will make a comeback. I think he called him in this episode, undefeated. We also talk about the future of stable coins. Ryan is particularly bullish on Coinbase's layer two. It's called base. Of course we talk about that. And finally we conclude with some policy takes. And Ryan has some particularly spicy takes here. Just me. On today's episode. David is out. Today he is ice climbing. True story, guys. We're getting right to our episode with Ryan Selkus. But before we do, I want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible. Bankless nation. Our next guest needs no introduction because we do this every freaking year. We have Ryan Selkus. He is the founder and CEO of Masari, which is a crypto analytics firm and media company, helping bring clarity to the crypto space. And every year he brings for us toward the end of the year, his theses going into next year. Today we are ending 2023. Actually, not today, but this month sometime. And we're entering 2024. So it is time to take a look at Ryan's predictions. He's his theses going into 2024. Ryan, how you doing today?"

So you start with this welcome letter. The carnage of the past twelve months in crypto have been brutal for all of us. We've grinded through bankruptcies, lawsuits, layoffs, turnovers and a general malaise that comes with a bad hangover after a big party. That's very much how I felt. We ended 2022 and 2023, I suppose for much of the year was part of that. How would you recap the year that was 2023 and how are we positioned going into 2024? At the highest level, I feel good."

There is a weird backdrop in the private markets, like the private venture markets, where there's still pretty significant dislocations in terms of prior valuations. And I do worry that some of the non token affiliated companies might be getting a little bit of a false sense of security, or this might be a false start in terms of resetting certain levels of optimism, particularly for folks that have been around for a while. But that's mostly a function of both the public software and private venture markets still being relatively icy, I think. Seed stage feels good. Series a feels good. Obviously the token markets are coming back. There's different narratives that are starting to get people excited. And then at the very highest level, bitcoin has a number of tailwinds. We'll talk about Ethereum as well as we always do and kind of bat that around, but I think the bitcoin spot ETF tailwind is probably the biggest wealth generator or potential wealth generator for folks within the crypto ecosystem, and that usually has a trickle down effect. We're in this little bit of a weird transition phase, but all things are generally trending positive, including policy right now. Might not feel like it, but I can certainly share some thoughts, thoughts on why I think things are slowly coming back to a good spot. Maybe this is the dark before the dawn there."

Solana and some of the other highest performing big protocols or mid cap protocols are up five, in some cases even upwards of ten x. So I certainly think it's almost undoubtedly and indisputably a bull market from the bottom, but there is still a ton of recursive investment within the industry. When you think about infrastructure companies, when you think about where we are from an ecosystem health standpoint, a lot of our long term growth and really hitting the potential for crypto and all these emerging protocols, it's going to come from real world adoption and crossing this chasm either with users or, in the case of Defi and financial instruments, with Wall street. And that's where we're still in a bit of a halting pattern, I would say. It's probably more acute on the defi side of things than it is for just bitcoin on the currency front, or some of the other emerging applications like Deepin and and non financial. We're not explicitly financial applications, but it feels like we could be on the cusp of a really fun year. It really just depends on how a couple of things break."

Because what we're seeing right now in the Solana ecosystem in particular, and this hot ball of money trade and all the enthusiasm for different alternative l one s or farmable ecosystems, it's very reminiscent of Defi summer in 2020. And of course, Defi summer 2020 was basically rocketing off the COVID crisis lows in March to a new high or right after the last bitcoin having. So it does feel a little bit like, I'd say mid 2020 in some respects. I always try to shy away from the different calendar year comparisons just because I think that there really are a series of overlapping hype cycles and rhythms to the market. On the one hand, you've got the bitcoin halving cycle, which for whatever coincidental reason, has just happened to work in pretty nice, tight four year cycles. And then others, you're analogizing a previous historical events. So for Solana, it's the crash to dollar 80 of ETH and all the nuclear events that happened around, consensus being very distressed at one point in that low, you can analogize that a little bit to what happened at FTX and some of the supporting infrastructure around Solana and kind of their resurgence. But, yeah, I think 2020 feels like the vibes. Depending on what part of 2020 you look at, though, that could be very scary because it was a shit show earlier in the year. And obviously, I think there are some things politically and kind of socially, culturally, that probably cause some related fears, even if it's not quite a pandemic that locks everybody down to their houses for two or three months."

If it doesn't happen, it would be both a surprise and potentially introducing a pretty big variable into the mix. We don't really know how the market will react, but I'd imagine it would be net unfavorable compared to what the year could look like. But the thing with the bitcoin ETF is Mike Novogratz and a number of other investors that we had at Mainnet Scaramucci said the same thing. Raoul Powell said the same thing. The one thing about Wall street is that assets are sold, not bought. You basically have a dozen or so of the largest institutions on Wall street that are going to be falling over themselves and ruthlessly competing with each other on who can market bitcoin harder to their investors."

In the background, you've got this four year cycle of the having narrative, and you could argue whether that's overplayed because the inflation rate is so low now, so the marginal impact is muted, blah, blah, blah. We don't really know. Then there were smaller but really important changes, like the FASB financial Accounting Standards board. Their treatment of bitcoin as a balance sheet asset has changed in a net favorable way, where you don't have to list it as an intangible.

You're basically taking a loss in your financial statements if it dips below, but then you don't subsequently mark it back up. Given the way that intangible assets are treated, there's, I think, a ton of things like that that all add up. But those are every single data point, every single narrative that I just mentioned. Those are going to be the same things that are put on glossy investment materials from all these big professional salesmen at the companies that are going to be falling over themselves to gather aum for their new bitcoin ETF products. And the only way that you really compete as an ETF provider is through distribution on the one hand and basically marketing customer acquisition on the other. There is no real difference between these spot ETF's. You can argue about, okay, ones going to be 50 basis points, ones going to be 75 basis points. Who gives a shit? At the end of the day, whoever does the best job with marketing and distribution is going to mass the most assets under management. If you follow that logic, then the incentive is for people to go above and beyond in terms of how theyre marketing these things.

We have Blackrock, we have Vanek and I guess GBDC. And Grayscale has somewhat of a head start too. Do you have any commentary on who you think the big winners will be?

I think there's a bit of a misconception about what an ETF approval or an uplisting does to grayscale as a business, based on the fact that they're going to have to lower fees and offer redemptions. Just because they will begin to offer redemptions and have to lower fees does not mean that that business is going away overnight or everything's just going to go to Blackrock. And there's one very simple reason. Taxes. So yeah, there are a number of clients of grayscales that are not, you know, I own GBTC shares. I'm not going to immediately redeem or transfer assets to another ETF product or even to coinbase necessarily, because that's trigger."

Now, I do think the fees will be reduced for grayscale, but it won't be sizable enough that it basically hurts them. Net net. I think you could see a scenario where grayscale cuts their fees by 50%. Maybe they lose 10%, 20% of their AUM. But I could also see them gaining because they already have a liquidity advantage and they've already got this kind of marketing engine in place and all the other products that basically they could come out net ahead with just some modest price appreciation expectations next year."

So about one fourth the size of bitcoin, but still an order of magnitude larger than kind of the next crypto asset, I would say. What's your prediction for ether? So where does ether stand going into 2024? It seems like the market has been fading. Ether maybe lately, particularly, there's been a big sole run up. I think in your report, you're talking about Ether maybe being squeezed between bitcoin and all of these alternative super fast layer ones. Yeah. What's your take there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So squeeze one way to put it. I think I wrote straddled, which may be slightly different. I don't think people are getting squeezed out of Ethereum, but I find it maybe not as unlikely now as it was a few weeks ago, just because the markets have continued to move in one direction. And at some point you'll have a reversion to the mean, potentially. But Ethereum out of l one s and network tokens, ether as an asset still is around 60 plus percent of the market. If you believe that network tokens are a winner take all market or power law distribution market like search, Google versus bing, then maybe that's sustainable. And maybe what you're looking at is ETH BTC, should ether be x percentage of bitcoin? Or ultimately is it going to catch up and maybe even flip because people think that there's more utility in the Ethereum network. I think the issue that ETH has is its trying to be both ends of the straddle, right? So bitcoin, its very simple, its a very easy meme. Its got all these narrative tailwinds. Its going to be the first out of the gate. Youve got all the institutional investors who are not overthinking this. Theyre looking at the back of the napkin pitch that I just made and theyre all thinking the same thing and thinking that everybody else is going to think the same thing because they understand it. The triple point asset thesis or the ultrasound money, which I know you guys have advanced, that resonates, but it's not quite as simple. It does take a little bit of an unpacking and you can pull at different parts of that thread. You can pull on the money thread. Well, isn't everybody just gravitating to bitcoin? El Salvador is not buying eth that I know about. Javier Malay is not talking about Eth. As far as I know, central banks aren't thinking about digital gold and naming ETH in the same part of the conversation. By the way, you've got this other assets, a lot of that's really coming up the curve and seems to be eating a lot of Ethereum's value. Now you're taking questions from both sides. I don't think that that's necessarily an indictment of Ethereum and the whole roll up ecosystem being fundamentally unhealthy, so much as it is a recognition that has been so dominant that it's tough to retain 60% market share unless you truly have a monopolistic business. And I don't think the block space is a winner take all or even winner take most market. I think that ultimately application builders and other parachains or parallel networks will ultimately go where they find the trade offs between costs security for block space to be the most compelling. And by and large that's going to make it very difficult for Ethereum to continue to compete on both availability and cost on the one hand, and if the ecosystem does get more and more scalable than the drive down fees because there's more block space, and so the supply and demand dynamics change on that side too. So I've thought more about Ethereum historically versus other Alt L one s in general, almost more like visa versus Mastercard versus Google versus Bing. If that's the case, yes, it will be tough for Ethereum to maintain its market share. But having said that, everything mean reverts and Solana and some of these kind of alternative assets have rallied so hard this year compared to Ethereum. If I'm wrong, it will probably be because of mean reversion, not because I necessarily think the long term thesis is wrong about this competitive positioning dynamic between the two."

I don't even think they've hit nine figures. Collectively, it's $100 million in the futures ETF versus what you saw in the first 48 hours with the bitcoin futures ETF. Very different. So I don't necessarily know that that is going to be a driver for Ethereum going forward, but I do think that Ethereum benefits if any of the other core narrative building blocks for bitcoin or the other alts l one s if they start to break down. So if you have another major Solana outage or there's a series of hacks that impact some of those early emerging DeFi projects on Solana that have gotten a lot of heat recently, basically a number of things could happen, and I'm using Solana as a placeholder, as the second in line behind Ethereum that hurts that community collectively on the one side, and it helps Ethereum net net on the other hand. At some point we do have to start talking about bitcoin's security model. The halving is a double edged sword at this point, because now your network security is down to about 0.8% per year. And I think that there is a question as to what level is too low. I don't know that 0.8 is too low to secure a trillion dollar network that's still tens of billions of dollars per year in security spending to the mining community. But it's certainly less compelling than it has been historically. And if you get down to 0.3% or 0.1% or whatever it is, at some point either a fee market needs to develop or there's going to be a breakdown in bitcoin's core security model."

Of course they hate it, because why not? One of the things that I wrote about in a later section at the investment transaction is bitcoin, essentially long term, has four different options. There's either going to be a fee market that develops and it'll be thanks to something like inscriptions and ordinals, or other bitcoin layer two, demand. You will ultimately find people starting to agitate for a switch to proof of stake. And this could potentially. I mean, it sounds crazy now just based on where the bitcoin community is, but you can imagine a scenario where bitcoin gets financialized and half of the bitcoin in the world is ultimately managed by regulated financial custodians on behalf of. Basically, we've basically created digital gold. And it's the same as the old players and kind of incumbents that are custodying these assets. That makes it a little bit easier on margin to have that conversation. At some point in the future, if the majority of the economic voting interest says this network is no longer secure, we need to fork it to proof of stake. Third way would be. You think about the 21 million bitcoin cap as a soft cap versus a hard cap. In other words, there is some lower bound to security that we should be spending as a network. The fee market is nothing, not maturing. We must maintain proof of work as an alternative to proof of stake. Otherwise, what do we just build all this for? If Blackrock and three other banks can just make the ultimate network decisions at scale, that might be an alternative that people take seriously, because they'll say, okay, half a percent annual inflation destroys the 21 million bitcoin meme, but at the same time, it allows us to incentivize these third party, energy intensive actors to secure the network. And that is a trade off that we're willing to make, because, look, that's still better than gold. That's still better than any other kind of fiat currency, and there's a natural equilibrium there. And then option four is irrelevance long term, because you can't secure a network with negligible fees. That's measured in the trillions. The security model just doesn't work. I put in the report. I think it's equal probability before those four, but the one that. That the one outcome, and I think the one future of the world that everybody should be rooting for if you're in a bitcoin community, is bucket one, which is that a few market materializes, and it actually costs money to generate bitcoin transactions on chain. And then you do push out some things, like payments to layer two s. I just wish that at some point in the last six years, we would have seen any sign of life in the lightning market.

Sometimes this happens where you just get so jaded and so emotionally scarred from a traumatic experience that you can't possibly imagine someone else figuring out what you didn't.

That could get very interesting, I think, over time. But I guess one high level question for you. You don't think that this is the chain security budget of bitcoin is not going to be a factor in 2024. We can continue to kick that can down the road, can we? Nothing."

But at some point, if this is not addressed and people start to see this dwindling fee market or issuance rate as a liability for long term security, ultimately that begins to get priced in. But it gets priced in very slowly. And I think the way that that would get priced in is net in favor of something like ethereum or another asset. So closing the loop on the first part of the conversation, I think to the extent that Ethereum outperforms in the medium term versus bitcoin in particular, that will probably be one of the factors."

This won't always be the case, you say, and yet you also say a little bit later in this section, for your friends and family, I wouldn't recommend investing in anything outside of maybe five or so crypto assets. And by the way, you're not telling us the other three, although I'd be curious to ask you what the other three are. So what do you think about this long tail?"

So now, if anyone from any community tells me that I should be taking their asset more seriously, I can just fib to them and say that they were part of the other two in private. But I think the point about number one is simplicity. The reason to keep things simple is not that other assets wont outperform bitcoin and ethereum, but because for someone thats just looking to get exposure to crypto as an asset class, definitionally, if you were just at bitcoin 2014 or whatever the conference was that Vitalik introduced ethereum at, you would have captured 75% of the market upside since 2014. So you would have captured that 100 x plus if you just invested in the Ethereum, ICO and bitcoin back then. And I always joke with folks that if you knew the early ethereum crowd, there's a reason I missed the ICO. You can know too much about this industry and not keep things simple because it was like the island of misfit toys. And fortunately I got in while it was still relatively early, but not as early and as dysfunctionally as maybe the first couple of years were. The but I think that's going to hold true for a while. Maybe there's a handful of assets that make up the index that you want to exposure to. Just so all of your eggs aren't explicitly in one basket being bitcoin, or two baskets being bitcoin and ethereum, or vice versa. But there probably is, I think, heavy bias towards being invested in the names that have a lot of name recognition just for the 70 IQ play on crypto on the one hand. The other reason not to get overly excited about any individual asset or basket of assets, on the other hand, is one, it's just really expensive and time consuming to parse through. The other $300 billion worth of economically interesting or not so interesting assets, but also most of them are relatively high inflation, especially compared to bitcoin and ethereum. I use inflation a little bit liberally just so that we can compare these on an apples to apples basis. And id include things like insider sales from some of the big foundations and labs and founder stakes that are prevalent in many of the other assets, three through 10,000, the price that youre looking at and the market cap that youre looking at, thats not on a fully diluted basis necessarily for the rest of the asset class. Youre basically trying to to not only compete against the top assets in the industry and bitcoin and ethereum, but you're also trying to beat the dilutive impact of all this net additional issuance, whether through the form of new tokens that are being issued through high staking rates or new assets that are hitting the market through token unlocks or early team vesting schedules."

        "text": "But my point is, I don't think that is true universally, but of course it's not going to be. You're always going to have a couple of outliers in that field that do very well. Multicoin comes to mind, betting early and really going all in on Solana credit to them. But is that 100% skill? Is that a confluence of factors? Skill and luck? Is it whatever. Just throw a dart and you're going to. If you throw a dart 100 times at a dartboard blindfolded, one time out of 100, you might hit the bullseye, regardless of your skill level. I'm not saying that about multicoin in particular, but rather in general, you're always going to have outliers on either side. But if you aggregate all of those dollar flows, they're net going to probably underperform the liquid market. For illustration of this, you can. You can even go back to look at Coinbases Series B with Andreessen Horowitz in the fall of 2013. That they closed, that I think bitcoin was trading around $100, $120 probably when it closed. And if you look at their valuation, I think Coinbase was around 140 million post money, if my memory serves me correctly. So Coinbase is a public company now is 35 billion. So just do the quick math. They've done very well. It's about 300 x, but it also 300 x'ed from $100. 400 x actually is the king. Even Coinbase, the most successful. I think really the only company to arguably outperform the market at that scale has been binance, but remains to be seen whether that's something that will persist long term. But that is to say, it is exceptional and rare. And the odds of you picking that as an investor and going all in on that thesis as an investor such that it outweighs the relative under performance of all of your other dogs, it's probably not going to be worth it. Having said that, I always was of the opinion that folks that were heavily invested in bitcoin and ethereum should be investing in critical infrastructure, because without the critical infrastructure, their bigger positions in the liquid tokens are not going to hit their potential. You do need those picks and shovels and as these big networks hit the scale that they're at the odds of another 100 x in bitcoin. If we have 100 x in bitcoin, then society has fallen. Thats not a good thing because that means that weve experienced hyperinflation events in the us dollar. You can get 100 x investments, you cant get venture scale investments, I think much more easily today than maybe historically. Itll be interesting to see how some of those funds perform. But the reality is, Nick Tomaino from one confirmation, whos had a tremendously well performing fund. I even think that, that he had kind of broken this down and the DPI for their early funds. How did it do relative to the liquid markets? It was, I think, neck and neck, maybe slightly under, but credit to them, they were transparent about it. And I think one of the reasons they were transparent is basically to say we've done very well by venture standards, and even we having done well by venture standards, face a tall order and outperform in the liquid crypto market markets. The last thing I'll say there is because of that dynamic, people will see that historical performance of the private and infrastructure related venture markets. And I do think that you'll see many more liquid investors begin to deploy against strategies, especially if we see market momentum picking back up. They'll want access to some of these liquid tokens because you can just as easily see if you avoided leverage and you avoided exchange blow up risk. The funds that really did well and absolutely crushed were mostly private and they were mostly liquid."

We obviously have Coinbase, we have galaxy out there, but there haven't been a ton of other large us public companies in crypto. Do you think that changes in 2024?"

I think to get out in this environment, in the US in particular, I'm not as familiar with the international public markets. But for anyone to really get out in this environment in the US, you just need to have an exceptionally strong regulatory positioning and no one else fits the job description. With the exception of circle right now, there are other great companies that I think operate the right way. They've never had a hack. They've had minimal slaps on the wrist for different issues. Kraken is one that comes to mind. But Kraken has been in the crosshairs of the SEC twice over this year. One for their staking product that they settled and ultimately had to wind down in the US. And now again, more recently, kind of double dipped and come after them with the same types of facts that they alleged against Coinbase. So tough to take a company public in the US and that environment when the SEC that would have to approve your listing, is also coming after you for various reasons. So I think that's unlikely. But I think Circle is one of the few that has both the numbers, the narrative, and the regulatory positioning to support that. Jeremy had mentioned earlier this fall when we spoke, and this was public, he said this on stage, but the company had done 800 million in revenue and about 200 in EbITDA all of last year. And the first six months of this year, they had matched that, and that's probably going to persist environment. So, yeah, just really well run. And so obviously, Circle is a company to watch. And then Jeremy and Dante, who's their head of strategy and their chief policy whisperer, not just in the US, but kind of internationally, we're also part of the two of the people who watch as well."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "People don't understand why and how Senator Warren is as powerful as she is. And this took me a couple of years to learn and really is just a function of the know, just enormous amount of time and energy that I've spent in DC, not just with policymakers, but I argue even more importantly, with so many other policy leads at the different industry groups and at many of the other companies and projects. And these folks have, by and large, come into crypto from DC, not the other way around. And they understand that Warren is as powerful as she is, not because she passes bills, but because she places personnel in places of high importance. And in fact, there was a good Atlantic article about her probably six, seven years ago that essentially kind of walked through the logic, which is she never had any interest in going to Congress and, like, passing bills that were renaming post offices and stuff like that. She explicitly said, said from day one, both explicitly and through her actions, that she wanted to pull the country to a more progressive direction and she wanted to basically have an outsized influence on financial policy. So much of your influence as a senator or congressman depends on your position with respect to committees. And from day one, having come from Harvard and then the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she was the first chair of to the Senate, she always had a very strong bias towards financial services. And ultimately she ended up on the committee that oversees most of our financial regulators, being Senate banking. When she ran for president in 2020, she didn't win. She fizzled out, actually, pretty quickly. But it was such a crowded field and she was otherwise splitting the progressive vote so closely with Bernie Sanders that there was a bit of a devil's bargain between the Biden campaign and Warren, that in exchange for her support, she would have pretty decently sized influence in financial policy in his administration. And that was both a horse trade that's an open secret in DC circles, as well as a just logistical necessity because Biden, even when he was vice president, had much more of a foreign policy bent than a kind of domestic policy bent. So he did not necessarily have the staff on economic policy and financial policy to begin with. And by aligning with Warren, it both helped him solidify the nomination. And then ultimately, she was able to place people in positions of high importance. So now if you look across the financial regulators that are across the board, almost universally hostile to the industry, they are almost universally well aligned and in many cases have direct hooks with Warren and are either former staff or just very long time allies. So, you know, I won't keep people's families out of it. But, you know, Gensler, he had a close family member that interned with Elizabeth Warren, the deputy director of the National Economic Council. That has been our biggest obstacle and one of our biggest critics within the Biden White House. Bharat Ramamurti, he was a former Warren staffer. He actually resigned in September. Who did they replace her with? Warren's current chief of staff or then current chief of staff directly in the same position. So there's pressure that she's able to exert from the financial regulators that she helps place senior most personnel in, and then directly from the White House in some cases. If you're talking about the NEC, where some of those phone calls ultimately came, when people hear about the pressure that the White House was putting on, for instance, Maxine waters in the other chamber, the House, not the Senate, to slow down or walk away from some of the bipartisan bills that came out of the house this summer. Those calls were coming from the White House. They were coming from staffers closely linked to Elizabeth Warren. And, and so you basically have this situation where she is, I've called her the shadow president of the economy. I don't think it's too far of a stretch because at the end of the day, this is an administration that is very, I'll be diplomatic. I'll say it's very heavily weighted towards autopilot based on, based on who's at the helm and kind of the age."

But when you paint the portrait of this is a senator that has massive influence in the executive branch, basically in terms of placing key personnel at indirect House as well. Yeah. Okay, so you got all that. Can I ask you just a meta question about Elizabeth Warren that I haven't been able to figure out, and I don't know if you have any answers to this.

        "text": "What progressives will tell you is that it's about financial stability, consumer protection, and national security. Those are lies. It is ultimately about control and the progressive establishment led by Senator Warren. I'd say when it comes to financial policy, what they really care about is, is getting the federal government and the Fed right through a central bank digital currency to have a greater direct impact on greater direct accessibility to everyday citizens. So they think by and large, that the private banking system, the kind of federal banking system, is a mistake as currently incarnated because it's. And there is some truth to this in terms of the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses that you see kind of throughout Wall street historically, but they still view that as a glitch in our system that ultimately needs to be brought to heel. And ultimately we should be centralizing as much of the financial rails in the economy as possible in theory. I don't think that that is a bad thing in terms of solving for some of the criticisms of the existing banking system. In practice, it's the most hellishly dystopian thing you can imagine because you're giving the federal government direct control over the financial banking and wherewithal of basically the entire citizenry. We've already seen what happens with deplatforming risks in social media. We've seen it in overdrive with Operation Choke point, which people don't remember or either don't remember or weren't paying attention, is not like a crypto bro conspiracy. This was an explicitly named fucking program in the Obama administration that the current FDIC chair, who was also then the Obama FDIC chair, ran for payday lenders and firearms dealers and the like, basically to de platform them, debank them from the financial system extralegally, because they were politically disfavored industries, right? They basically just ran Operation Choke point back. They don't call it Operation Choke. .2.0 we kind of came up with that moniker. But they're running the same playbook that they did with the explicitly named Operation Choke point a few years ago for some of those other politically disfavored industries. So I think that it's incredibly dystopian to give the federal government that kind of control just because we're not governed by angels. And ultimately, I think the same reasons that you and I are excited about crypto and the decentralization of finance in general are the same reasons that I'd say 90% of Americans probably agree with us, that the decentralization, at least, of the banking system is probably better than having a central, central bank governed digital currency that's going to be able to direct, debit or credit your financial account."

But it's less about, is it less about direct benefit and more about this is the way it should be and we think we know best, and therefore we're pushing this out there."

I just look at history and the history of centralizing the economy and the financial economy in particular. I don't live in that country. I don't live in that world. Right. So just period. Just because we don't decentralized power very well. I've never really seen compelling counterpoints. To the extent that people use China as kind of a modern example of the CCP and its control of the economy, shepherding it into this new dawn. One of the reasons that their model has been so successful is because they, they kind of hot swap the back end of communist China in the eighties and nineties to capitalism, right? So I think that it is, if I heard a progressive case for further centralizing Wall street or disintermeting Wall street and kind of being able to go directly to the Federal Reserve and kind of further federalizing power that had any historical analogs, that didn't end in national disintegration or fascism, then I would love to hear it. So maybe a listener here will be able to send me some links or counterexamples, but I've just never seen it. And so until I see some historical example that would disprove this, I tend to believe that this is one of the most evil things that could be foisted on the american people and in general, and the onus is on their proponents to prove otherwise, that this could be managed in a way that wouldn't be outright dystopian and frankly, contrary to the Bill of Rights and all of our constitutional protections are kind of embedded in the operating system of the US. And I think that's really where this fight boils down. As you know, I've been outspoken on this and at times impolite. And one of the reasons that I'm impolite is because if it comes to our constitutional protections and people that I think are going to run roughshod over them because it's convenient or because that's just their political persuasion, I think that we should tell them to fuck off."

Grayscale was able to amass a massive, massive aum base that I don't think is going away, even if it does shrink slightly, which even that's arguable. That business is going to be strong for a long time. And it's really led the charge in many respects, both in terms of institutional adoption. A lot of people don't know this, but, I mean, I would say Grayscale is responsible for three bubbles and one first, 2013, when the product was originally formed, that was the first institutional exposure that people could get through. Second, market kind of amassing into this bitcoin investment trust product. Obviously, the levered grayscale trade from the last cycle, where funds were plowing in bitcoin, using leverage in terms of amassing more shares and then hoping to flip them on the open market. That arguably led the late 2020 and early 2021 rally until that trend reverted. And then if you think that next year is going to be a third bubble, then I'd argue that they're probably going to have a pretty meaningful part of driving that forward just based on their lawsuit victory against the SEC.

I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it was like 240 down to 200,000 wallets with that description for USDC. For US DT tether, it was basically the inverse, and they've climbed all year, particularly on the back of the Silicon Valley bank crisis in March, that I think hurt circle because they had their assets at SVB. So the great irony is that circle probably needs better protection from the us banks than the us banks need protection from crypto. Ridiculous. And I think tether on Tron, and tether just in general. But I think TROn being the primary settlement platform in terms of the availability in Latin America and Africa and Southeast Asia, it really is, I'd say, probably the most widely used killer killer app for crypto, particularly when it comes to financial inclusion that we've seen to date. So I did not have that on my bingo card for the most widely used and most important apps that we have. But I do think right now is probably the case."

So, like, all the anger, all of the. All of what's happening in public, right. It's performative, but in private, the reality is very different. Different. And I think if you look at Tether, this is a perfect situation where you could see real crypto cafe between the us government and a project like Tether. Tether is one of the largest buyers of us treasuries. They work very cooperatively with the us government when it comes to things like AML, KYC. And the alternatives for the us government are basically shut it down and lose a surveillance partner, or to let it go on and keep an eye on it and make sure that it doesn't get too big or out of control. But otherwise, we'll sell them some treasuries, we'll keep an eye on it, and ultimately, if they want to survive and not go to jail, then they'll play by our rules. I think. I find it very difficult to believe that the us government wouldn't have found a way at this point to go after tether unless there was that dynamic in the backgrounds. And frankly, I think that's kind of good for all parties, but especially for tether, which literally and figuratively just prints money as a company since they sweep the interest on those treasuries basically to the company versus anyone that's."

Like, you know, it's different from finance in the sense that you know binance well, it's similar in some cases, right? I mean, binance gets a big fine. There is a deal that's ultimately cut in terms of what CZ is going to have to cop to and we'll see what a sentencing is. But obviously it could be radically reduced versus what you might expect given the magnitude of what was accused of buying a. But the trade off there is now the us government is a little bit more closely tied to binance, the platform, and now has better surveillance capabilities. So to the extent that you see anything at tether that is similar in terms of the government cracking down on them or going after them, I would imagine it's probably not dissimilar from the binance situation and that tether is basically allowed to exist. They pay some sort of fine even in the case that the government really comes after them. But the us government just finds a way to tighten its surveillance hooks into the project. And the more they play up the wild west nature of tether and the more they fight them in public and engage in kayfabe here, then the more credible it looks and the more people will continue to use this asset that can then be fully surveilled and that liquidity and all that demand doesn't just flow to something that is even more difficult for them to wrap their heads around from a sanction standpoint or just a general surveillance standpoint."

They're the net benefactor, or, sorry, beneficiary of the drama at Binance on the one hand, the concentration of custodial assets on the other. When you look at all the ETF providers that have been choosing Coinbase as their surveillance sharing partner and ultimately their custodian for these applications. But I would actually say that one of the most interesting things about the businesses is all of the on chain and permissionless infrastructure that have been built building. I think the Coinbase wallet is best in class right now. The MPC wallet, they've made a lot of investments in terms of the embedded wallet as a service infrastructure they've been promoting. I even joked with Brian at Mainnet. I feel like I'm kissing his ass and I'm usually a pretty tough critic, but I just think that they've been monsters this year from a performance standpoint, and they're almost back to break even a pretty hellish exchange backdrop. And I think base is that last missing piece of the puzzle. So they had the wallet, but base basically is the parallel chain that allows them to, quote unquote, take an l two or an exchange affiliated blockchain network public without all of the baggage associated with BNB or actually issuing or selling a token and then trying to prop up an ecosystem way. So theyre basically able to use the optimism stack. They can be contributors to that community, its highly performant to their specifications. Theyll be able to build an ecosystem around it. Now, the lines getting a little bit blurrier between the base blockchain, Coinbase, the company, all the permissionless tools that theyre building. And youve got this spectrum of lock in across both centralized and decentralized alternatives for people getting into the crypto industry. So it's equal parts, I'd say, a way to continue to keep their users essentially have their cake and needed to kind of keep users locked into the Coinbase ecosystem. But I think it's also a really invaluable hedge to have given the positioning in the US from a regulatory standpoint where they need some way to play in these frontier markets where historically they've been penalized by the uncertainty in the US and not being able to fully engage. They were handcuffed by the number of assets they could versus an overseas exchange. It would list everything. I think that patience is ultimately getting rewarded in the stock price. But more importantly, I think it's just a really excellent addition that they made and core asset that they have, not that they own it outright. Maybe they'd object to my framing, but I think that affiliation and that that outlet for some of this on chain activity, to this l two, is going to be pretty invaluable for them moving forward."

If you look at Frontech and the explosion that it had over the summer, that whole onboarding process, the bridging on the Coinbase wallet to base the scalability of that mvp, I think they knocked it out of the park.

We talked about tether, we talked about USDC, of course we talked about bitcoin. When you look at USDC and tether and you look at bitcoin, we see both ends of the spectrum. I think Nic Carter calls tether and USDC crypto dollars. I kind of like that term, rather than stable coins is like kind of like a dollar backed IOU, if you will. And then we have our completely separate store of value assets like bitcoin. So we have both sides of those spectrums. Do you think we get anything else in between? I mean, every cycle it seems like we try something with cryptoclateralized stablecoins. I mean, you could say Makerdao has been somewhat successful with Dai that's still at play. It's not growing as fast as maybe the bulls would have hoped. We tried some algo stablecoins last cycle that absolutely collapsed. What's new for us in the crypto money thesis going into 2024?

And again, there's a lot of allegations that have been thrown around, but now folks are saying that all those volumes were fake and that application wasn't real or whatnot. But at the time it seemed like you had a payment application that was useful with some underlying economic model that could ultimately feed the algorithmic stablecoin and create a least something that wasn't just turtles all the way down in terms of crypto collateralized money. The issues and the blow up risk were well known from day one, but at least you had that kind of fee engine and that potential path to sustainability. That was interesting. And I forget the market cap at the time, but I think it was low. It was like 50, $60 million or something like that. It was, I think, a reasonable bet to make if you thought about could someone or could some model ultimately come to fruition that figures out how you can bring an under collateralized stablecoin to market that doesn't just collapse from day one under its own weight. I've kind of gotten. I don't say jaded. I'm very skeptical. I feel like that was probably the closest we were going to get to running that experiment at scale. And I'm almost not sure whether worth running again because the risk will never disappear. And you saw how catastrophic the losses were from terra getting to 40 billion or whatever the high water mark was. I couldn't imagine the repercussions of an algorithmic stablecoin that tweaked some of the model parameters and then got to 400 billion, right? Or 4 trillion. Now, if that unwinds, you're collapsing the global economy. So I don't know. I think there's some interesting plays that are being contemplated right now. I know a couple of folks have written about flat coins and do you have stable coins? It could potentially map to purchasing power versus actual us dollars. I don't know. I think it's going to be extremely difficult. And I think at some point we're going to have to have cooperation with nation states when it comes to stable currencies. That's not to say that they won't ultimately all fail or hyperinflate, or at the very least inflate. And so you lose purchasing power over time. Time. But part of me kind of thinks that's what bitcoin's for, right? I get that own bitcoin and then own your dollars, but don't try to mix the two and then create another. Just catastrophic."

You could point to any algorithmic stablecoin project right now and show me 1000 positive metrics.

I know you've long been a supporter of the Zcash project, but also, I mean, I feel like if there's one battle that feels somewhat unwinnable in the US, it's just like privacy. We've got tornado cash smart contracts being sanctioned. Do you think we can get privacy on our crypto monies either at a crypto native store of value like ether? Some sort of set of smart contracts, a layer two, something to give us private transactions?"

        "text": "I think that what Zuko and the whole Zcash team did in terms of advancing that whole field of cryptography, I think it's incredible and I think it'll be a notable achievement. For a long time, the original sin of Zcash was restarting from the same issuance schedule that bitcoin did, which I dont think could be repeated. Bitcoin was a miraculous bootstrapping mechanism because it was first with Zcash you had this instance where from the second they launched, it was a straight shot down. You could never build excitement out of the early. You can never really get people fully bought in and fully endorsing or promoting this technology. Then you also had all of the headwinds from the regulatory state. But even today, if you look at Monero versus Zcash, Monero is almost an order of magnitude bigger. Now, part of that might be because of the issuance schedule and the way that they brought the token to market. But I think another big element is maybe zknow tech. I would argue it probably is one of, if not kind of the best privacy preserving techs that we have, but is better instantiated at the application layer for these networks than it is at the base layer for two reasons. One, not everything needs the same level of privacy. And so if you privatize the entire chain and you basically render all blockchain analytics elite, you have bigger problems even than AML KYC. With zcash, if everything was private by default and shielded transactions, it also, at scale would have been very difficult to audit the supply long term. That creates, I think, some risk that financial regulators worldwide would never allow for. But I think the other element is the flexibility that you get from having quasi public, quasi private. And the spectrum of privacy is probably going to be better for almost all users because think about the case of an audit. If you're a big bank, you can't showcase or tip your hand as to what you're doing with customer funds on chain, because someone like chainalysis could come in and they could review the wallet addresses and they could say, okay, this is JP Morgan, and they have this customer set, and this company just reported earnings. And so maybe this address or this on chain movement is due to this particular transaction, whatever. You just can't have that. So I think the kind of hybrid privacy model is probably something that is going to work better at scale. The paper that Vitalik Amin, Soleimani, someone from Chain Alice, a couple of other academics came out with earlier this year, privacy pools, is kind of this I say, bridge model that might work."

The more libertarian conservatives that are kind of pounding the table on civil liberties and the bank Secrecy act as an overreach, whatever the case may be, just trying to rein in the surveillance powers of the state. Ron Wyden fought for crypto in the nineties, like crypto being encryption. And now I think there's no crypto wars on the right. And then if you kind of run it in reverse, right? Like the Dick Cheney Patriot Act School of the republican wing and all the neocons, now they're getting lambasted in presidential debates, right? Dick Cheney is a slur in republican debates now. And I think that neocon establishment is essentially dead. I mean, I think that right now, probably 70% of the demand for, or maybe even closer to 75% in the Republican Party, if you just look at kind of the leading candidates, it's for, I'd say like anti neocons. Right. So kind of this new, more libertarian strand of the Republican Party. So it's this kind of like freaky yo yo of the two parties and kind of where they stand from, at least that form of progressivism or kind of libertarianism, civil liberties in particular.

I know people don't really believe me about this, but I wanted to give myself a year buffer between the election and my political discourse because I just, I think it's going to be. I think it's a losing battle. I won't give you that. Maybe over beers, I'll give you the full anecdote, but literally, there was one conversation in particular that happened like a week on either side of the one year mark before the November 5 election. And the change in attitude between this person a week before and a week after in terms of some of my rhetoric, was hilarious. And I was like, this is just kind of confirmed that this is way too spicy to be involved with as a sitting CEO in an election year. I'm not full time politician competition. And so some of the things that I'm saying I think about more through, like, an analyst lens and as someone who just kind of knows what we're going to need to do to win for the industry, even if it's politically unpopular, because it does skew in one direction pretty decisively. So that's one disclaimer I'd say. We already talked about Elizabeth Warren at length. And I think that's kind of, of the thrust of where we should maybe dovetail the conversation, because this is actually a good segue from the previous point.

And it's one of the reasons that, again, personnel is policy, and the reason that Elizabeth Warren is so effective is the same reason that we can actually make pretty significant strides as an industry on both sides, but particularly on the republican side right now, and making sure that some of the voices that are elevated have a strong libertarian or kind of civil liberties focus behind their personal platforms, their personal ethics, because those will ultimately be the people that are selected for another administration if it is Trump. And we get the same kind of Goldman Sachs bankers that we had in the last administration, in the last, however many administrations that just don't like this industry, we get another Mnuchin, you know, basically, maybe he comes back, right? For instance, then, yeah, we don't, we're not really marginally improved. Or maybe we are marginally improved, but only marginally improved. There's nothing that's, like, really different about the, whether it's the Biden administration or the, or the Trump administration, depending on who the personnel are. So, you know, for instance, I've been very supportive of Vivek Ramaswamy, as you probably know. And he has a small path to actually getting the nomination, who knows what happens in 2024? But just looking at the polls, it's a very narrow path. If Trump is out of the equation, he has a much greater potential path. But if Trump is in the conversation, he's probably going to be the nominee. And you want as many people like the vague in that inner circle and in a position of influence as we can, possibly, because the administration is just that. It is a large group of people with one person at the helm, but it matters who's in the room, and we didn't have that with Steve Mnuchin. So I think this proxy game is really important, and we can actually learn from Elizabeth Warren in that regard. So I won't spend too much time going on. I don't want our options to be what they are for the presidency. I don't get to pick a important battle that must be won is in the Senate. There is no future for crypto in the US if the Democrats hold the Senate, really, at least not until 2030. So the good news is that the electoral map or 2029, effectively, right, when, you know, when there would be another administration that sworn it. And that's because Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, who's the chair of Senate banking, will remain I blockers on anything productive and essentially let any financial regulator kind of run roughshod over the industry in perpetuity if they're in the oversight chairs and in that position of influence. So if you have a changing control in the Senate and it goes from 5149 in favor of the Democrats to 5149 in the other direction, which is really only going to require one net seat since West Virginia's Joe Manchin has decided he's not going to run for reelection. That's the difference between who has the final say on financial regulators. And so if it is a Biden reelection, then the radicals will just get kicked back outright. Someone like Gary Gensler will never make it through again. And if it's a Trump administration, you're going to have more of, like the Hester perch camp or someone like Christian Carlo or Brian Brooks, who's in the last administration that sit in some of these positions of authority. And that is a very material difference for our prospects as an industry."

So the window of time where there is a majority on the bench that would be sympathetic to crypto as an industry, and at least leaning in that direction to check the power of the administrative state, that's not permanent either. If you extend that out another five years, we're just as likely to get an unfavorable court ruling from on high as a. As a favor."

You know, this is more or less known, and I'm looking at this just as an analyst, no bullshit, what the state of affairs actually looks like. And at some point, you need to take people with their word. Elizabeth Warren, when she's raising money, I believe her now, to raise and to recruit an anti crypto army. And every single story that you hear from leaders on that side of the aisle in the Senate and basically in the positions of greatest authority, it's all tying us to North Korea and money launderers and tax evasion and blah, blah, blah."

But the reality is the folks that are in the most important seats on that side of the aisle, the senior most committee leaders, and the people that are ultimately going to be blockers on policy, that's what's at stake. It's not whether there are good individuals on either side, but this is just kind of the dynamics and power structures in play. Anyway, that's my final disclaimer there. I feel like I've had six disclaimers. I'm still going to get a lot of this for this segment, but I think in the long arc of history, time is our friend. Crypto remains inevitable as a technology, and it's just a matter of where it blossoms first and where it firmly takes root. And I think the economic economics, the incentive structures of crypto incentivize competition in much the same way that startups are incentivized to disrupt the incumbents. So it would not surprise me. And in fact, it's probably the expected outcome that a technology like crypto is going to be fully formed and brought to mass adoption by an economy not named the, the US for the sole reason that the US currently has the reserve currency, the dominant financial system, and."

Why should I change my name? Why should I move to suck? And they just won't refuse to step aside, even though so many of these folks are closer to the end of the line than crypto is, that's for sure. But I think compounding just if you zoom back, zoom out a little bit and you just look at everything that's been developed. Bitcoin didn't exist 15 years ago. Ethereum didn't exist until ten years ago. Even as a concept, it didn't launch until nine years ago. Solana was born five, six years ago. As a concept. Defi really didn't blow up until the summer of 2020. Nfts a year later. You just go through the list, man, and it's just one development after the other. Yes, there are these hype cycles. Yes, there are these big crashes. Yes, there's a ton of headwinds from some very powerful people that don't like us right now. But eventually growth almost always wins out. And you can be in a stick in the mud for as long as you want to. You're either going to come along for the ride or you're going to get left behind. And I think whether that happens to the US or internationally, maybe it starts to happen internationally and then that old, like, Churchill saying comes through, like, you can always count on the US, do the right thing when all other options have been exhausted. Yeah, maybe that's our saving grace in terms of how crypto comes to proliferate in the US. But I think there's multiple paths to get there. One, I didn't say it's over forever, I just said in till 2029 or so, depending on the outcome of this election. But that's not a permanent condition either way, because this technology is not getting uninvented."

I think it's going to be a costly and really intense battle next year, but I have never been more confident that we're going to move the needle politically. I'd encourage people to check out the resources that I linked to in the theses. I think the three to watch are Coinbase is stand with crypto movement, the blockchain association. Kristen has done a great job uniting the warring tribes and the blockchain association summit just had a who's who of speakers a couple weeks ago, and then Mike Carcase from fair Shake, who's running a super pac, I think he's going to raise some eyebrows in the new year. So I think there's room to be optimistic. And I certainly am. And I'm probably most excited. The thing I'm most excited about, Ryan, is I wrote the policy section first, knowing that my work here is done. And now I'm going to spend. I'm going to spend 2024 being degenerate and playing with all the toys. Have fun. And literally just dogfooding and power, using our product as an investor and showcasing all the functionality."
