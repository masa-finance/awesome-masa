Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of dexs on Solana. Today we're talking to Meow from the Jupiter project, which is perhaps the super Dex, the super exchange on Solana. We'll talk about what that is. Earlier this week, the Jup token, the highly hotly anticipated token out of Jupiter, has actually launched. This token was announced back at Solana breakpoint in November of last year, and it's been hotly anticipated ever since. It just came in at a $6 billion fully diluted valuation, which is equivalent to uniswap on Ethereum. So a very big launch. We got about $800 million of that actually circulating. So that is the actual market cap. And we're bringing on Meow, the founder. That is his pseudonym. Apparently it's very close to his actual real name, but people just call him Meow. He is a cat in a space suit on Twitter. We're bringing on Meow to talk about what is Jupiter, what is Jupiter under the hood? And then also the token launch. So this will, I think, be a hybrid episode for the ethereum community, which bankless, of course has, is the majority of the bankless audience who have never experienced Jupiter before, or maybe only touched it once or twice, have heard about it, but don't really know what it is. That would be, I would call the first part of the episode the first half, and then the second half of the episode is going to be more geared towards the Solana people who are interested in the details of the launch of Jup. There was a bit of controversy about the launch of Jup that I heard. I am not super tapped into these conversations, so I'm coming at a very high level. Meow will give his account an explanation of the mechanism for the Jup launch. He will give his side of the story. I do not have the capacity to give what might be the other side of the story, so you'll have to search for that elsewhere. Whatever Solana circles are discussing this, so there's a disclaimer there. I guess overall found it pretty fascinating. There are definitely some differences about what Jupiter is on Solana versus what the typical dex aggregator is on Ethereum. Meow walks through all of those things and then we also just get into the other conversations like the load on the Solana network. What's next for the Jupiter team with the liquidity that they have sourced as a result of the token launch? And also what's next for Jupiter teaser? They are hiring if you are looking for a job. And now let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with Meow from Jupiter. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
Speaker B: Banklessation.
Speaker A: I'm here with the founder of Jupiter named Meow. Meow, welcome to the show.
Speaker B: Hey, how's it going?
Speaker A: Nice to meet you, meow. So you just had a gargantuan token launch. A $6 billion app just launched a token coming in at $6 billion. Diluted value. Yeah. New value into the world. Congrats on that. How does it feel to be post launch.
Speaker B: Man? Thanks for asking. No, nobody asked you that yet. No, no, seriously, thanks for asking, because no one has really asked me yet.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So thanks a lot for asking. We know that the team has worked really hard, right? And certainly the funny thing is that we do control the value. We don't. In fact, if you ask me and stuff, it's like, okay, it's like the market gave us this value. Then on our end, I think we're incredibly lucky, unfortunately, to be a recipient of this value. And I think it is, on one hand, like, okay, we are grateful that things didn't mess up. We're extremely grateful that, I mean, we were able to give a present, right. To a lot of people, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I mean, lots of people are like, I mean, obviously, I wish they kept their joke, right? But lots of people like, hey, I could pay for my meal. Hey, I could buy. I could finally buy my iPhone, right? And I feel like, I feel like that kind of. I mean, obviously we hear a lot about, like, no, they're playing a gaming system and getting lots of, like, lots of capital, but there's all these, like, you know, many small stories, right. You know, and that's pretty happy for me. So I think. I think it feels very grateful, you know? So I think on one hand, I think it's like, accumulation of a lot of work done. So we're very happy to do the do it manifest that, right. You know, also giving prize on people. And also. And last but not least, I think, I think, you know, I think it must beginning. You know, I think this whole process has been this, um, amazing community process, right? Because value is not generated by a team. If you're making a pencil, for example, maybe, but if you're making a coin, a currency or token, then the value is generated by community ecosystem. So that's not least, obviously, incredibly grateful to the community ecosystem for doing it for us.
Speaker A: I think Solana, as an ecosystem, is learning to how to do airdrops. We had the geodo drop. This is like the second big drop after Jito. There's been others as well, but really, these are kind of the two big ones. And so I'm. One of the things I've been curious about is just learning about how Solana app teams learn to navigate a very difficult process of beginning actually to decentralize their whole app. I want to get into that subject later. But as you probably know, and as listeners definitely know, this is more. We have a more of a Ethereum focus on bankless. We are familiar with Ethereum. We know how these systems work on Ethereum. So I want to unpack what Jupiter is under the hood for our more Ethereum centric audience. So the next bit of questions is, if I were to pop open the hood of Jupiter, what would I see? How is it different? And then I'll ask, how does Jupyter uniquely leverage Solana? But for people that don't know what Jupiter is or don't know what it is and haven't used it before, what is Jupiter? It's an exchange on Solana, but take it from there. If I were to look under the hood of Jupiter, what would I find?
Speaker B: Okay, if you don't look under the hood, just look at the car. We are a full service exchange. We have swap very limited orders with DCA. We have hubs, and we serve the gateway to Solana, onboarding to Solana. And we also have a launch pan, which is just launched. So that's what I see on the outside. And what you see on the inside is that you see this extremely meticulously designed, elaborately engineered over three or four years. Over two or three years system meant to find the best routes across the whole Solana network in a way that is as fast as possible, because as you guys know, Solana broadcast is 400 milliseconds. And also Solana transaction speed is very fast, and also transition fees are very much lower in many ways compared to other networks, whereby we had to find. We had to aggregate across all the markets and then also find routes, not just for larger trades, but also very small trades. So our goal is very simple. Whether you're doing a two cent trade or whether you're doing a $100 trade or million dollar trade, we want to kind of effectively kind of route through the system.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: In a much more effective way.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And one big difference to Ethereum is this. So Ethereum's constraint is gas fee.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: We know that. So on, that has a different set of constraints.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: It's like the account, the account size limit is smaller and different. So it's like basically how do we kind of like constantly navigate that? So how do we kind of like build a system that's extremely optimized, right. For like Solana's like, you know, speed and cost, but sometimes like, you know, handle its limitations, you know? Yeah. So, so that's kind of what we see. Um, or that. And, and that's the soft aggregation. So that sort aggregation powers a number of systems, right? It powers the, uh, it powers, um. It powers the soap, obviously. It powers the limit orders, it powers the DCA, you know, but also you also power certain key things about the, um, the perks as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Yeah. So, and, yeah, so I think a number of things. Yeah. So, so that's what's the end of it. Yeah.
Speaker A: On the surface, you have these different ways of swapping. You have the swaps, a limit order, dollar cost averaging and perps. These are all just ways to make a trade happen. And then under the hood you said that it's a Dex aggregator. We have Dex aggregators on Ethereum. They do exactly what you say. They find liquidity across Ethereum and then they package it into the best execution for their users. Is Jupiter a source of liquidity as well? Is it an amm, like uniswap as well? Or is it more just of a, an aggregator of liquidity? And it finds liquidity elsewhere on Solana. Where is the liquidity coming from?
Speaker B: So three different ways, right? The first way for the swap limit on this year. There's no liquidity for the purpose. We have liquidity. Actually, we actually have one of them. We actually have one of the most largest by volume in Defi. Our perks did about 1.4 billion in volume last week.
Speaker A: Okay, so Jupiter hosts its own liquidity for its purpose products.
Speaker B: Yes, precisely.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Yeah, precisely.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then, and then for Launchpad. And for Launchpad, we get, we source liquidity from teams.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: To host on the platform.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then, and also, obviously we also host the airdrop as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: For people as well. Yeah. So, yeah, so, and I think I would say this, I think we are extremely so. And by the way, we really, I think one thing that I'm very proud of at Jupiter, right, is that we really push the limitation of Solana to a limit.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: For example, there are a few things that, for example, Solana in the past had this problem where transactions can only be so big when they send the transaction in. And they implemented lookout tables. So we're the first to implement lookout tables, we're the first to implement priority fees and first to implement. And basically anything that Solana does, we're the first to incorporate into our system. I think we are a really good example of composability. On Solana, you can basically go through like six or seven markets on Savannah for like transaction fee of like 0.00, $0.02, you know. Yeah. So I think that's actually one really, really cool thing, I think. Yeah. That we really focus on.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I definitely want to lean into that. But really just to round out the liquidity question, the swaps and the limit orders, where do those, where does Jupiter source its liquidity if it's not everywhere on Solana? So there's other like amms or other order limit orders on other apps and then Jupiter assigns them.
Speaker B: So that, so that's a few. There are actually a range of. It's actually interesting. It might be interesting for your audience, right. Because on Swanna you also have for example, you know, stick. Stick and sticking, right. So for example, if you, if you go, if you go from so. Right to stick. So liquid sticks, so. Oh yeah, sticking. Right. Liquid stick, so. Right, like judo soul or like all that marina.
Speaker C: Marinate.
Speaker B: So. Right, so, um, Jupyter also integrates something called sanctum, which essentially allows for immediate staking and unstaking. So on Jupiter, you can immediately go from a very large sole order to a very, very large to the very large liquid. So in the same transaction, so you rush through the Emms and cops and also that one thing. And so the way back to. Right, I think there are actually a number of really interesting and obviously clob is actually very proficient as well, but you don't really see them anywhere else. And actually integrating all these different systems at the Amms and Cob's and things that sanctum into one system, it's actually quite challenging. Also another thing, another kind of ams that you have on sauna is like a single sided liquidity pools. So basically, I think because the cost of so low, you do see a bigger variety of like, you know, possible liquidity systems they don't see elsewhere.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's actually something quite interesting. What Jupiter does, right, is that we actually spend an incredible amount of time and effort, right. Trying to. Okay, I'll put it in. We are aware the Amms take off their training rules, right. Because they build and build and build, but they're not sure what brakes, right. But the moment they plug in our system, that the first 2nd there is like hundreds of orders flooding in right. In the first minute.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think sometimes they break. So we work with the team to really try to fix them and everything. And because a lot of these systems are very novel.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, so they, so we work with them a lot. So under the hood. So if you look under, if you look at, if you look beyond under hood to the people working under the hood, right. I think you will see, you will see a team that is like very, very committed, you know? Right. And I mean, it's not me, by the way, it's the engineers.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, like, they are very committed to making sure that the whole system works as well as possible.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, that takes, that they really understand that every single detail about the amm, you know, and take how integrated everything.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And we had the same amount and we had the same level of dedication to our products. Right. Order swaps and DCA and pubs, everything.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: So that's, that's. I think. I think that's what. Under the hood. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker A: So you were about to get into it, and then I wanted to go back and just, like, tie off that liquidity question. But I want to ask about how does Jupiter leverage Solana? Solana has unique properties that no other blockchain has. You know, it's extremely fast. It's got some parallelization to it. Uh, what are the strengths of Solana that Jupiter really leans into?
Speaker B: I I mean, the, the most obvious one is cost.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, it's like, um. Like do, like it's cheap to execute a complicated trade on Solana, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Um, it's very, it's more. Okay, so, so I will say. I would say this, right. It's like, besides the, um, besides the technical capital, right. There's also ecosystem. So Ana actually has a very, very well developed ecosystem. And so it's actually two things. So you have a lot of different kind of emms and with people who are investing real technical effort into designing new systems. For example, Phoenix is an extremely different system for open book, and open book v two is a very different system from Phoenix and a bunch of other open worlds coming as well. So you really have a lot of people who are investing a lot of time and effort into their own system, but obviously you don't have volume at the start of new system. So what we do is that we plug you in and immediately you get all the retail flow and everything we do that. I think to us, it's not just about leveraging the sauna, but also the ecosystem as well, which is very, very important.
Speaker A: One of the big stories about Jupiter was that there was no vc funding. It was bootstrapped just from you and from the team. Can you talk about the genesis of Jupiter? Like how. How did the idea get started? How did the project get started and when did it get started? Tell us about the Genesis story.
Speaker B: Sure. So actually, so actually, so let me go, let me go way back, right. So we started out as a. So actually I did a lot of stuff in Ethereum, right, as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker A: Pretty typical. Everyone, everyone generally has their start, you.
Speaker B: Know, like, and also I also started WTC, you know, when I was like working them with Bitgo and everything.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I was actually really active in Ethereum, you know, I just didn't talk that much. And anyway, any, anyway, anyway, we started a project called Mercurial.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then mercurial project started as well. And then that that project took funding. That project took funding.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then, and then over time, that ensured the project didn't do. Didn't do that well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and didn't do well. And then eventually what happened was that, and what happened was that we started, we started, and from there we started Jupyter as a new project, as a completely new project, while Mercurial became Meteora. So now with a project called Mitora. So it's also doing extremely well as well. It's also doing extremely well right now. Basically, I think the genesis of Jupiter started as mercurial, which did take funding. Right. Which did take funding.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then it had a token as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then it transitioned. And then in about, and then in about February 2023, we took a snapshot.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then we took a snapshot. And then now 5% of total drupe supply goes to mercurial stakeholders. Okay?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, while 100% of the circulating supply of mitorae goes to the mercy holders. Yeah. A snapshot taken in 2023. Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. So there were, there were some other applications, some other startups that you started before Jupiter. Eventually you pivoted into Jupiter and then. Would you call it a pivot?
Speaker B: No, no, no. It's a new project. Yeah. But the original project became etora.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Yeah. So I mean, I mean, we documented all these things in exclusivating detail.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: In many different places, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But I think, I think eventually we were able to. It was actually, I don't get me wrong, it was a long process.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But I think eventually we were able to come up with we were able to kind of like, I believe, and it's my personal belief.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And certainly I think a lot of people appreciated it to create, I think, two projects, Jupiter Mitura.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, that had a lot of value.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and we were able, I think we, I think when we. I think. And be able to find that value. Right. To the original mercy holders. Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. All right. So where did the idea, the inspiration for Jupiter come from and how did the team form?
Speaker B: The integration for the inspiration of Jupiter was quite simple.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Is that like. Okay, so obviously aggression is not a new idea, right? It's not a new idea.
Speaker C: All right.
Speaker B: But it turns out to be excruciating hard to do. Okay. Yeah. So the initial, so the first few other books on, the first few other book systems on, for example, one major source of liquidity for Solana early on was serum. And serum works completely different from amm, regular amm. So basically, and then, so basically the very, very first step that you had to do to even integrate, to even integrate this major source of liquidity was to understand zero. Right. So basically, I think what will happen was that we were playing around with a number of different. Number of different ideas. No, no, I didn't bring a number of meetings. Okay, so one thing is very simple, actually, as part of my Ethereum background, right. I've always known something.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Essentially, whichever, if you have the best price, the best token selection and the best ux, you win. You tend to win over time. Might not immediately, but over time you win. So I know that because I was part of that, part of the system. By the way, David, just to let you know, I'm very happy to talk to you because I've been obviously more Solana podcast.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So talking to you is really fun because I kind of bring back to Ethereum. Thanks for that.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But yeah, back to the point, I feel like I knew very, very well what would be.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And one of the things that I always notice is that, okay, why don't people use aggregators on zero more. Yes, right? Yes.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then, and then while on the altus, right, there's just not that many. Not that many like different emms. Right. They bother, you know, so you just go directly there.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: So, so anyway, with that, so anyway, with that understanding, I was like, okay, you know what? Like, okay, on, um. Um. So I was thinking, hey, you know, aggregator on Solana will probably be effective, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Because, um, you know, and if you must have built it well, right. So anyway, back then there was actually three or four different aggregators on Solana already, right. They were trying to make it but then we were looking around at them and they were like, they can't do it because they couldn't, they couldn't figure out the most basic thing about how do you make, how do you make amm work with a clob, right. That is very, very different because they work completely differently. So I think we invested about. So I think, I think we invested about. So it started out more as a curiosity thing. Hey, you know what? Hey, how do we can actually be done right? How do you do it in a way that, okay, so another thing is important is that we are very uX focus team so we have a lot of hardcore engineers and stuff, but we are all very ux focused. And I think that combination is very important. Being able to do the hard tanker work but also being able to really care about the user experience because that was very difficult. So I think eventually, I think after three, after two months, I think it was two months, it was really two months of raw work just to do one integration. But then at some point I understood. Wow, I get it now. I get why, I get why no one else is doing this, right? Because it took us two months just to do that simple integration.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, so I think after, I think, I think after, dude, after we did that, I think that gave us a lot of like confidence, right. To spin up Jupiter as a new project, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And we, and we went from there. Yeah.
Speaker A: So that's how many people are on the team. Like how many engineers and or front end devs give us a snapshot of.
Speaker B: The team now or back then.
Speaker A: Now, yeah. Uh huh. Or maybe if there were other important phases to talk about too. Like what was it like in the past and what is it now?
Speaker B: Oh, yeah, probably six, seven in the past. Six or seven in the past. Yeah. When we, when we started on this whole, when we started on, I mean, we kept pretty small for a long time, you know, and then now we are like 16, 1718 around there and growing quite rapidly, you know, because we do actually plan to do a lot of things. But yeah, it was, it was, it was a period of like very intense, like experimentation. And again, I feel like it's one of those things that, I feel like there are a lot of teams that hop between Ethereum and sauna and other things. I feel like don't do that. I feel like it's very difficult because to win in any ecosystem requires a lot of very deep faith in the community. I mean, you know this, right? A big part of whether your product gets interaction is if the broader community accepts you or nothing.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I think that was actually one problem.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Is that. But one thing that's just interesting here is that I think back at the peak of the Solana hype, I think a lot of other more prominent aggregator, everyone signaled they want to enter Solana, right?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: In the end, only one did Kyber, but I think the others didn't. And it's because of what I talked about, there's a really, really big tanker herder to even get a function without working and even after they get it working to iron out all the different details.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And don't get me wrong, you know, it's funny. It's funny. I feel like the process that we went through was probably very similar to the process that the early if guys went through, right. I mean, can you imagine life before ERS 20? I mean, come on, seriously.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: You know you'll be crazy, right? Or even before a lot of these new things came up, right? Yeah. So I feel like we kind of went through that phase together.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, that's why. I think that's the reason why over time we built up a very strong, like, understanding, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So that's about it, I guess. Yeah. So that's, that's how it works. Yeah, sure.
Speaker A: Let's get into the launch of Jupiter. You actually announced the Jupiter airdrop incoming at Solana breakpoint last November. And that's when the snapshot was, at least for phase one. We'll talk about what phase two and beyond looks like. 955,000 addresses were eligible, almost a million. And just for comparison, the largest airdrop of all time was the arbitrum airdrop at 600,000. Arbitram optimism had 250,000. I mean, I know that it's like pretty cheap to spin up a new Solana wallet and then start transacting on it just because the fees on Solana are so low. But what do you make of this very high, like, address account? Like, why are there so many active addresses that were eligible for the Jupyter airdrop?
Speaker B: Yeah. So just to recap a bit, right. I think in the, in bitcoin, we announced a number of things. We announced the token, we announced a token sale. We announced a, a launch pad, and we also announced a bunch of other also now spurbs as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: We also announced a new stable coin. Shitty. So it was actually a very, it was a very cool time for us because over the last two years you've been building, right? Just building, you know, so it was just really cool to just be out there, you know, like for the first time in two years, right. I think it was also really great because like everyone used Jupyter before, right? So it's a product that they had already had a very close with and they knew very well. So it was like a, I feel like it was a combination of like knowing the product and wanting a new token in the ecosystem. I think that, and that's actually why I think it was actually extremely bisector, right. So, and I think so I think a big part of that, I think it relates to a question you're asking, right. I feel like most expert users want to wallets at least $200, right? You know, and certainly we do know of bought farms, some bought farms that actually ran like, ran about like, I think ten k was the Max we had, right? And now actually we know pretty well, we actually know pretty well right now because everyone started coming out, right? So actually we have a big sale now. So the good thing is this. So let me, let me give it to you in the no, in the most no bullshit way possible, okay? I hope you trust me on that, right? In a sense that I do believe that roughly half was like really legit, right? You know, because the number of excitement that we had about token, right, and number of like. And we see it now, right. It's like to sustain a $600 million airdrop is actually not easy, right? You actually need a real community to actually give us this, right. Also to get.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think, I think so I think as soon as there's real assignment, right, this call is going crazy. Everything, right? So I think I would say that. I would say about like half is a brew resource. That is my best guess if you ask me.
Speaker A: Half of addresses are real. Half, half.
Speaker B: No, no, no. Duplicates. Duplicates, not fun. Duplicates. Duplicates.
Speaker A: Okay, okay.
Speaker B: Like the user having two or more wallets, right? You know, and I'll say this, we only found, we actually did extensive cluster analysis on it, right, because we want to make sure that. So we actually didn't find because David, remember this, right? We didn't announce an airdrop at all, right? One of the things that we were very, very careful about was that because I hate promises, I hate promising things, right? Because certainly I think in my past experience, whenever I promise something, things fail, right, because there's expectation and then domestic things fail, right? So I think one of the things that I was very, very, very careful about over two, over years was that with no token talk, no adopt talk right now. So, um, so I'm actually very convinced that no one actually did that. And then, and then when we did the cluster clustering analysis, right, you know, we did find. We did find some clusters, right? You know? Um, but then it wasn't, wasn't that much right now, but then. But then something. But then something interesting happened. Um. Is that like, um. Is that like, uh. Is that like. I. What, what was that? What was sipped our attention, right. I'll tell you this, okay? What sipped, our attention was that, like, there was a big farm of our 10,000 addresses. Okay, that came in the last minute, you know, because what happens at approaching breakpoint, right, November 2, right. The hype became real, very high.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Right. And then, and then, and then, and then, and then we. And then the token wasn't announced yet, right? No, but there's a lot of hype.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think what I think happened was that someone started farming then. So he spun out, like, spun up like 10,000 wallets and stuff and traded everything crazy, right? So that is, like, the only. And that happened, like a few days before, right? So. And that was only when the token top became real.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And also they did that. So that's the only big one that we found, right. And that was very annoying for me.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Imagine someone running a script taking out 2 million dupe, right, and dumping in the market. I. The fuck? I'm like, no, okay, but David, okay. If you're interested, I mean, since you're interested in details, right, I will tell why I miss that, right? We miss that because we divide our. What we did. We. Because we divide the address into two categories, okay? The first category is like, hit base, right? That means it's like if you trade, like for, if you trade a $1,000 above and stuff, you. You get the. You get a lot more, right. It's not really a thousand, but it's based on the top number of people traded, right? And then. And some modifiers.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: And then we did. And then because we wanted to be as inclusive as possible, right. We allocated 200 joke to everyone.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: That means that whether you traded a dollar or $0.50 or whatever, you get 200 joke, right? So, and because, and because I had this mentality of, like, being as inclusive as possible, which, by the way, I still think that's the right strategy. By the way, I still think it was the right strategy. For me to give 200 to everyone right now.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: However, I think, unfortunately, I think so. Unfortunately, we ran the cluster analysis only for the ones that got large amounts of juke, and we didn't run the cluster analysis for those 200. So we missed out on that. On that big fat cluster, mainly because I was like, okay, everyone should get something. But what I expect was that there was this big fat fucking cluster. Fucking annoying for me because we tried really hard. So it's because, you know, custard analysis never is never accurate.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, you never. You can never get it precisely right.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I was, okay, whatever. I'm just gonna give the benefit of doubt to everybody and stuff, you know, and just give 200 to everybody.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Uh, yeah, but. But as a result of that, we did miss out on this, like, giant cluster that probably came last minute.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: Yeah. So that's the, that's a big miss for me. Yeah. So it's fine. I think. I think there'll be future airdrops. I'll do better, you know. Yeah, that's it, yeah.
Speaker A: For the historical addresses that used Jupiter, like, when did Jupiter go live? When was some of the first trades that were eligible for receiving? And then overall, over the span of Jupiter's history, for the people that got the airdrop, what were they trading? Were they trading Solana for other tokens on Jupiter? Was it USDC being traded on Jupiter? Kind of like, what's the qualitative nature of the activity on Jupiter for the span of time that. That Jupiter's been alive? Like, what are people trading on Jupiter?
Speaker B: They trade, actually trade a lot of different things. Like, for a long time it was. For a long time it was. I think we went live on November, about October 21, October 2021. Okay. And then close to the peak of.
Speaker A: Solana mania in 2021. Yeah.
Speaker B: Some say down, but yeah, yeah, but yeah. I feel like let's just digest a bit. I feel like that's actually why I think the community approaches us so much. It's because I think we started at the peak, and then even when the markets looked really, really bad and everyone ran away, we were committed to it, and we were the most front facing example of that. So I think that's the reason. I mean, don't get me wrong. It goes two ways. I think they were appreciative of us, and we are appreciative them too. So this is this harmony, which is why things have a high level trust, because we were there. Um, but back to your point. Yeah, I think it was October 2021. And, uh, yeah, so, um. And then October 21, I think. And back then, if I'm not wrong, mostly just trading. So USDC, right? And then. And back then there was like this, uh, first, uh, like the first generation tons. Like, for example, you're the first gen coins, right? You know, you have like, uh, like. Like tokens, like, like oka and radium mango things like that, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So, so that was actually the ones that were kind of traded, right? And then that, uh, that actually. And that was true for a while right now, and then. And USDC. USDC was pretty big as well, right. You know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And some level of like, womb ho tokens too, you know? But then after. And that was the first phase, right? First phase of like, first phase. And then you have second phase, obviously. Um, everything. Everything crashed and died, you know, after the FTX thing. Um, so activity actually pretty much like went to, um. Like. Like the tokens, the. The. The burning was horrible, right? You know, like really, really bad, right. You know? Um, and then, uh. But Bong came up, right? Bonk. Bonk came up. The bonk came out and was big, right?
Speaker A: And that bonk came out, like not too long after the FTX implosion, right. It was something December of 2022 or January.
Speaker B: A bit later. A bit later. A bit later.
Speaker A: A little bit later. Early 2023 Q 120 23.
Speaker B: Around that. Yeah. And then. But that was big, right. Because that was like the first fucking mingkong, right. You know? Right. That showed that, that showed that tokens at life, right. You know, on Solana, right. And what was also very important was that, like. And big credit bong here, right. Is that I think the bong team, like norm, like I 89 and primitive and like Kaizen and Casey, I mean, like this whole gang, I. We love them, right. You know, because I think they really, um, they really, I think, embody a lot of the, um, the community ethos, right. You know, and learn from them, right. But essentially, I think, um. Uh, that came out. I think that that that was important, that that show that sauna had life, right. Because, uh, I remember it funny, because, um. I mean, because I think people were saying I was talking to some friends, right? And, uh. And they were like, yeah, but it's just a meme coin, right? You know why? But I'm like, yeah, dude, but it shows that Solana has capital to deploy, right? It definitely showed that Solana had capital to deploy. And even outside of Solana, people were paying attention to Solana, right? You know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: It's those two things are not nothing.
Speaker A: Right. There's a canary and a coal mine for sure.
Speaker B: Precisely. But if you have capital to deploy.
Speaker C: Right, right.
Speaker B: And then you have a community willing to like a bit.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then you have attention when you look into it and stuff.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: It's something, right. And obviously bong went through that tremendous ups and downs picking recently and stuff. Right. You know, right. To autumn high, you know, amazing for them.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, I love them. Yeah. But anyway, so, so. And then so, so that was like, so for a long time, that was like a bong and other like smaller meme coins. But while they got added to the mix.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then recently, obviously the meme coin thing went crazy.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and we said that this went crazy.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, uh, went crazy. Um. So, so, uh. So, so I would say now is the. Since a few months back, I think it was like the whole, um. It's pretty exciting because our volumes, like, not just us but everyone's volume went up like crazy.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Uh, because like you had this like audience and meme coins, right? Like the top with hat, you know, like uh, the Gen Z, obviously. Peace. And now Julie.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Came out as well. I think what we're going to see is that like we are kind of entering the fourth phase right now whereby joke and whereby you have like this, like I would call it really, really good projects. They're all not launched tokens yet come to launch tokens.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, so I feel really, I feel very excited about that, you know, because I think that all those tokens are going to bring a lot of excitement and vitality to the trading space, you know? Yeah.
Speaker A: So part of the Jupiter token launch was the Jupiter launchpad, which is one of the things that you announced at Solana Breakpoint. Now, launchpads as a product, these are tried and true products in the crypto space. They even exist in the tradfi space. We just use banks for them. This is just a new primitive that Jupyter is bringing into the Solana ecosystem. Can you talk about what the launchpad does and then talk about how the jup token leveraged it?
Speaker B: Okay, great. Thanks for asking. So I think at breakpoint I announced the intention to build launchpad because I really, really wanted launchpad, mainly because I think I wasn't too happy with existing launchpads in the sense that you must be very familiar with the token gator model whereby you had to hold FTT in order to buy the tokens. And then they do what we call a supply squeeze. That means that they actually limit the amount of supply available at the start and ramp up the demand. And so the FTT holders benefit because the thing goes like crazy, right? But obviously, obviously happens that later on, the people that believe in token the most buys a token, but they get dumb into things like that. So you see these really big spikes. All that is caused by what I call the supply scripts, right, where you don't have enough supply in the market right? Now, another model that's another model, another launching model that's really famous as well is what we consider to be the, it's what we call the, I call them the isolated pool model, right? You know, whereby you, it's not in the open market yet right now, but you pull capital together, right? And this can be as simple as the ones that mango did, which is like you had x number of like focus on the market, x number of like USDC, and then the end pool is what you get. Or it can be like the LDP model, the balancer LDP model, where, and then you have other models like, you know, the, you allow multiple, you allow multiple parties, including adopters, to put the tokens in many, many ways to do it, right? But I think what I didn't like about that model, right. Was that like, it was impossible to predict what happens, right? I, because think about it, right? With that model, with those isolated pool models, your most enthusiastic believers bind to that pool and then based on how fast the pool goes and stuff, and then the price forms. But then the thing is that your most enthusiastic believers and stuff doesn't equate the market. You don't actually know how the market will react. And the airdrop meta and the airdrop thing, but which I actually believe that the airdrop way, air draw is the way to go in terms of like, it's just a fantastic way, right, of like rewarding users and benefiting community, right? And I can get to that. That's a very important thing too, right? But essentially, I think. But, and then you add on to this adopting, then you just can't predict, right. How you go. So what, what? So the isolated pool model, right, you have this really big problem of like, okay, so quote unquote, you just, you have price discovery in the, in a very isolated pool, right? But then when you go to the market, it just goes down or go up, you don't know and most likely go down.
Speaker C: Why? Why?
Speaker B: Because your most, your most active supporters already bought in the pool, right? So, so I think, um, so I think that those are two things that I think, uh, so, and then, and then, and then thirdly, is that you have the adroit meta, right? The adrobe, the adrobe, the adrob thing is where the addro thing is where you just add up and they, and they sell right in the market, right. I think, I mean, that works. However, the mine is extremely erratic, right. You know, because I, and then furthermore, and furthermore, like, furthermore, even, and furthermore, the liquid tend to be very thin, right? So a big, a big, a big selling just down the token. Right. Way.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then as a new token, you don't really want them, you know, especially if you're on chain, you know, you kind of want to, and so you kind of give your, yeah, so I think, I think so. I think our launch pad is okay, also. Our launch pad, it basically says that, okay, huh. Given that the open market is the best way to capital tokens, right? Given that the team, given that the team, given that the team often needs capital, but I want to do it in the most transparent way possible. And thirdly, is that given that we don't know what the demand, what the demand dynamic looks like, maybe a lot of people dumping, but no one's buying things like that. Now, how do we develop a launch pad that is relevant for this new meta of open market discovery? Sufficient liquidity and also team capital. So that was the basis that went on building launch pad.
Speaker A: Okay, so for the price discovery of the Jup token, what were some of the economics on launch? What did that look like using the launchpad and for the drupe tokenization?
Speaker B: So essentially, I think there were three components. There were three components to it, right? You know, so the, the first component is obviously, so the, we call the LFG launch pad, right? Yeah, that's what we go, right. Essentially, everybody starts at the same slot, right? So everything's all right. So basically the airdrop, airdroppers can claim and sell, right? People can buy into the pool, right? You know, at the same time. So what we did was that we set, we set up, so the way the Jupyter RFG platform works is that projects can set up a price curve, a liquidity curve, right? Sell only pool. A sell only pool, it actually works exactly like providing liquidity on anywhere on ECLM or DLM, whereby you set up one side liquidity. But there are two differences here, right? The first difference is that we have a tool that allows the user to specify three things, right? The project, the three things the project specifies, the insure price, the max price, and the curve right. So a steep curve for me looks like this, right? That means that, okay, your initial price. Your initial price can be low, but it goes high really fast.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: A low curve goes like this.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, so I think. So I think for Jupiter, I think we set up a pool that looks like this, right? The initial price was like 0.4, which was like half, roughly half or about. Of the. Of the post price, you know, and then the max price was. .7 right?
Speaker A: So your own, the Jupiter perps product allowed for some amount of price discovery ahead of the launch.
Speaker B: Only. Our post only does token that exists. Right?
Speaker A: Okay, so there's other perks like Avo on Ethereum. I think maybe the drew. Okay, so you had some information about what the market was pricing ahead of time.
Speaker B: So we're talking. We're two information points, right. But it's also fascinating, by the way, guys, I'm so happy, by the way, because I feel like so interesting. It's so interesting to kind of think about this thing, right. Because I'm getting a bit. So let me just share with you. Yeah, so, so, so there are two places of the two points of like point discovery, right? The first was Avo, right? Which was. And that's. The second was the wheels market, growth market, right? So those two things allow us to. So these two things. And honestly they went to big fluctuations.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, in the, in the month, in the previous, like over the last few weeks in signal of the thing, right? So, but the. But anyway, anyway, I think we are very new to this, right? It's like, we are. Okay, so one thing I kept, one thing I kept emphasizing my twitch was that we are using Joop as an experiment for launchpad.
Speaker A: Launch pad, right. Dog shooting, right.
Speaker B: The reason it's very simple, right. Is that a lot of people are okay onset. Got a lot of shit for that, right? Because they're like, oh, why don't you launch in December when the hype was not so high, right? Why don't you just launch a token, right? And the reason we did launch a token was this, right? It's like if I didn't build a launch pad, if I didn't launch using my own launchpad, then how can I ask any project to use a launch pad? It's not possible, right? So I think that was a. So what people don't realize is that we actually didn't spend, like, we actually spent the whole agenda bringing on chat, right. You know?
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: And I kept telling people, and David, I'm telling you, I learned so many lessons. So many lessons. And a lot of the, a lot of the backlash that you see about launchpad is a result.
Speaker C: Lessons, right.
Speaker B: You know, like lessons in communications. I learned a lot. I can apologize if I didn't communicate things properly. I really do. Okay. And secondly, I apologize if people didn't understand mechanics enough, which is why I'm hopping on all these shows to try to explain it, right. You know, but back to the point. So I need the point that Jupiter is a lot. We experimented, right. You know, and I can talk more about the price curve later on because that's very important. Okay. But anyway, but we have this tool to admit I'll interview, right? You know, this tool to allow you to turn a simple price curve with three parameters, initial, max and curve, right? And they'll show you how much you translate into a graph to show you how much you raise, how much your system you create, and then you pass the team these parameters, and the team will load the tokens according to these parameters. That's how it works. But I think it sounds a bit extract. So let me break down for, in detail what happened in the load drip launch. By the way, David, I just share something with you. I actually describe a lot of these mechanics in theory over many long posts, right? But I think it's very helpful to understand kind of like this thing. And don't get wrong, it's not just them, it's me too, right. If I, if I, if I read something, I don't understand it, right? But if I see something happen, I get it, right? You know, so I think. So let's, let me, let me break down what happened during the launch, okay? So at a certain slot, right? Slot. So sauna is a slot, right? You know, slots. So at a certain slot, these things are going, right, you know? Right? And then, so people were over claim, right. You know, and then the market started moving, right? And we severely, we severely, we sever, we severely trotted the first, like a few, first few slots to prevent too much voting, right? But otherwise anyone, otherwise, anyone buy, otherwise anyone can buy and sell right into the thing, right? But I knew what was that. The, what happened was that, like. And so then there was a lot of boss, right, going to the pool and taking a liquidity, right? Because the first part of liquidity was always cheaper, much cheaper, right? So in many ways, what we did was that we as a team offered tokens for sale, right? Starting at, starting at 0.4 to 0.7, right. You know, but remember, it's an open market pool, by the way.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: It's not a close market pool, right. So everyone was interacting at the same time claimers were dumping.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And then they could dump in the right way. Right. You could dump tokens in right away.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And that's actually very important, right. Because that actually gap of real time view, right, of like, what's actually happening.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, that's. Let's fucking go. Right. It was actually very intense because as a pricing. So initially the price only increased.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, which. What does it mean? It means that it meant the price just kept increasing initially, right. Which means that initially people. There were a lot of people who were willing to buy at $0.40, right? And not enough people dumping it. And not people. Not enough people selling at $0.40.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then, and then, and at some point the, the. And then, and then anything crazy, right. And at some point the. And then at some point, the. The centrist actually just came out as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then, but, and then it got all. And then, and then we, and then we started seeing quite a bit of selling right now at the. I think when it hit like 50, 50 something cents something sense, you know. Right. I think. And then I think it went to, like, I think it went to even about 70 cent, $0.03.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Somewhere else. And then it's the backtracking.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: And backtracking.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Basically the demand, basically, people started selling more than they're buying.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, at like the 70. 70 cent mark, right. And then, and then. So we didn't, we actually didn't finish the pool, right. We were like 2 million. There was 2 million troop left in the pool, right. You know, and started retreating right back to like sixty five cents. And then, and then, and then, and then throughout the last two days, it has been about two days now. It has been like going this range, right.
Speaker A: You know, it's actually been, like, relatively stable of a price. And to me, it's actually been kind of incredible because, like, Uniswap is currently valued at something like four or five or $6 billion. And Uniswap's on, like, the bigger network. Granted, uniswap is only one application. It's an amm, and Jupyter has many more, like, apps on it. But being valued above, like, uniswap is, like, pretty monumental. So, like, in my mind, you tell.
Speaker B: You tell me, like, we above. I don't think we're above Uniswap.
Speaker A: Aren't you?
Speaker B: No. We have 800 million market cap now or something?
Speaker A: Oh, I'm talking about fully diluted valuation. I always talk about fully diluted valuation.
Speaker B: I mean, that's a meme, right?
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it is a meme, but. Yeah, but I mean, it's what people. It's the price that people are able to get, right.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: I mean, $825 million market cap, fully diluted, 6 billion.
Speaker B: Yeah. Around that stuff. So. So, I mean. But do you mind if I finish something?
Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead. Yeah.
Speaker B: That's important for me to explain this.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Is that the reason? So the pool actually worked as intended.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Because what the pool does is that, like, it created a backstop.
Speaker C: Right, right.
Speaker B: So people can sell into.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And that's actually very important for two reasons.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Number one is that, like, you know, air droppers that wanted to sell the tokens always have the create itself into that, to me, was important. I mean, I don't know why, but to me, it's important.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But otherwise, it's not a real presence.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, if you don't set the hands back.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I. And secondly is that. And secondly is that. I believe. I don't know yet, but my belief is that it gives buyers a lot of confidence, because if liquidity is very bad thin and you have very big airdrops, remember, we are giving away. One thing to remember is this. We are giving away at current 600 million.
Speaker A: Right. So the airdrop was 10% of the total supply. Right. So total supply is 10 billion. You gave away 1 billion.
Speaker B: Yeah. 1 billion.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So easy to understand is that present 1 billion tokens.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: 1 billion tokens available. Claiming.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, so basically. And there was some, like. And there were some, as I mentioned, the farm as well. The farm that claimed 2 million tokens.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So he literally dumped a million right into the.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So in any other model, you will see the price go to crazy fluctuations.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Crazy.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Because there's no. There's no food. There's no new food that can take a million. No way. No way.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, but what happens at this pool, because it had a lot of capital buildup.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, it was able to absorb the damage.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So basically it gets. It also gets biased confidence, too.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Okay, cool. Okay. I can. I can buy into this pool without getting wrecked. Right. I certainly does what people told me.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and I don't have any, like, scientific proof for it, but it makes sense to me, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely. It's somebody. You're much more like familiar with just like markets and just like what goes on under the hood. But somebody, I look at charts, I can tell a stable chart from an unstable chart.
Speaker B: I.
Speaker A: And looking at the Jupiter chart, that is a stable chart. Like that is not crazy.
Speaker B: It's crazy. It's crazy. It literally went like event. It literally followed the exact liquidity curve and just gonna wait and that's just came up and just stabilizing. And not just that. Yesterday. Yesterday when there was a lot of like, you know, criticism.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And a lot of like, oh, I consider them like, you know, an unresearched, you know, comments, I think. And like, it went down a lot, but then, but it didn't go create. It didn't go all the way down.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Because there was. And then because there was enough, like, you know, people who could be in there.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Yeah, that's it. You know, and so I think, um. So I think so I think at the end of the day, I feel like it's a good system because the people, the people that bought the tokens early, right. They believed that was, that was the price they willing to pay.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and, and, right. You know, and then, and certainly in our case and stuff, it didn't go too far in.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, it was like it stayed in a relatively high range. And secondly is that this pool is team liquidity, but the team, this is not just for Jupyter. We are also, as I mentioned, we are experimenting for all launchpad projects. We are locking in for seven days. Any project that uses launchpad, the condition is that they must lock the liquidity of seven days. That means. That means that if the founder goes crazy and starts dancing naked in Times.
Speaker A: Square, you know, do you have these plans?
Speaker B: I don't know. I can tell, but yeah, but whatever the case is, whether there's always some like big news, whatever stuff. Right. You know, there's also the seven days.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: For the price to stabilize right now before the liquidity. Before liquidity can be taken out.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think. I think it also acts as a backstop pool.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, for stabilizing, you know, things like that. Obviously, I think it's up to a team and we have our plan to do so.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Certainly when you take out a lot of liquidity. But it depends. For example, the price could be way above it already. So taking out liquidity doesn't matter.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Or it could be still within a range. Like Jupiter, for example. For Jupiter, it looks like it might be within a range when I take it out. So we need to be very careful about communications. We communicate very carefully about how we can think. And that's my bad. So that's actually my bad.
Speaker A: Okay, so maybe, can we just unpack this a little bit more? Okay, so there's the initial bootstrapping liquidity, which is the mechanism that we've been talking about that's producing the price discovery for Jupiter. This is part of the launchpad product. This is also where Jupiter, the team gets some of its funding in the future, but it's locked for seven days. Is this all, is this all correct?
Speaker B: Yes, David. So let me do my clarify something. It's pretty important for me. So it's also quite hard to understand. It's not hard to understand, but it's obvious. But let me share with you. So the curve, the price curve that we have is nothing. Price discovery, because there's a lot of people dumping elsewhere, everything. So price can be going everywhere, okay? But it is, it is, what it does is that it ensures a lot of, it ensures sufficient liquidity at every price point, right? Now remember what I talked earlier, right, about the supply squeeze, right where you, where you, where, where the launch pad suppresses supply, right. You know, in order to create the spike which benefits a small cell, people. I hate that. I really don't like that.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, I really don't like that, you know, because I think, I think what that leads is to, it leads to a system of. I like the people that. So I call this anti, again, I'm trying to figure something. I'm trying to. It might not, it might not work, right. But I want to do a anti fomo, anti promoting, whereby along every single step of the way, right. You know, there is a special sufficient liquidity, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Yeah. And that's Jupiter, right? Jupiter, it was priced low initially. Another mistake that I made was actually price lower. Okay? So I thought I made a bunch of mistakes, but it's okay because future projects can learn. But I think for me, I did a few mistakes. I should price it at like 0.25 and 0.5, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But I think, and the reason I was scared of being bottled, right? But I think I was too scared of being bought, right? But long story short is that along every single. So it's not really price discovery, but more like this curve is there to make sure that there's sufficient supply at every step of the price discovery so it doesn't go crazy, you know what I'm saying? Right.
Speaker A: Like secondary discovery or like, yeah, like stable discovery, right?
Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
Speaker A: Okay. And so this is the liquidity coming in from the Jupiter. Um, like the Jupiter team, would you call it? Because the Jupiter team is supplying the Jup tokens. And then over that seven day period, this juke tokens get sold for USDC or Solana or like, what's, what's the other half?
Speaker B: USDC.
Speaker A: And this liquidity is locked for seven days.
Speaker B: Yes. So we see the team. So basically the. Okay, the. Okay, so another mistake that I made in communications, right, is that I use the word. I wasn't careful about how I was using the words, right. And I didn't, I also didn't appreciate how, I also didn't appreciate how, like how, like how LP. Single sided LP. So I kept, in my long blog post, I was very technical. I said that single sided LP and blah, blah. I didn't even answer all the things. So it's my bad, you know, I didn't communicate well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And I think that led to a lot of, like, misunderstandings. But it's really my badlanda, by the way. But long story short is that the team provided, and by the way, one thing I would really encourage everyone to check out because we've really spent a lot of, a lot, like immense amount of time on.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: It's our token accountability. Okay. We really kind of spent our time making sure that every single juke is accounted for, you know? So I would encourage everyone to check those things out. Okay. And we also label all the, you know, all the wallets and everything very, very close, very clearly. So anyone that wants to track anything that goes in and out, they can just track it very easily. Okay? Yeah. But any. In our case, right, we. In our case, in our case, right, I think we had about, we had about 3.5% of tokens that was taken out. So, so we have four, we have four community observed wallets. Okay. Code. The team code. Community code. Team multi sig. Community multi sig. So those are the community observed wallets.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And we consider those to be not part of the circulating, okay? Right. So, um, so, so as part of that, we took out. So as part of that, we took out 10%. We took out 10%.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, for the, for the, um, the adro.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So that's consistent circulating.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: We also took out three by 5%.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And of which 2.5% went to the pool.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Right, the pool.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and then, and then, so, so that was the. And then we had 50. We have 0.5% for mm loans and other sex and mno and other sex needs. And then. And then we. And then we have 0.5 for. In case we needed. In case the pool ran out and we need to provide liquidity to other systems. Right. Urgently.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So, so that's the extent.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Of our. Of other tokens that we had. Yeah. Anyway, long story short, was that. Long story short, yeah. So there is a 13 point. There is 1.35 billion right now in circulating.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, 10% is adopted. I think 69% is claimed already, I think.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So it's claim ready.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think. But we consider all that circulating. Okay. And then we had about. And then we have about. Yeah. And then 2.5% is in the pool right now. And so about, I would say 80% of the tokens are already having. So the pool right now, I think about 80% or 85% is USDC, right. And the rest are juke tokens.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But anyway, anyway, so anyway, so assuming the price remains the same, right. You know, at the end of seven days, the team, which is us in this case, has the right to take the tokens away. Actually, honestly, three days.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I was traded, but then I think we are making seven days. Okay.
Speaker A: How much total value is that?
Speaker B: Total value? I mean, in USDC there's about 100 in there right now. But that's the price stays.
Speaker A: Right. Current prices, correct?
Speaker B: Yeah. That's because the way it works. That simple. Right. Is that if the. Another mantra is very simple, right. We believe that the team should. Again, I'm trying to develop a model not just for Jupiter, right. But a model, I think me as a retail participant and as an ecosystem player, want to see, right, which is okay, the team should get whatever the price set is at, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Not the peak price or whatever. Not. Right. Because actually, okay. I mean, we all know what happens in these kind of situations, right? Right. The supply squeeze and the ding pumps and then the team sells at the top, you know, very, very common.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, things like that. So, so that's. That's not the opposite of that, right. You know, basically when the opposite of that, right. You know, basically that the team only gets. Very simple.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: Now, if the price. If. If I. If the price settles at 0.7 settles at 0.7 and stuff, then I think the. Then the team will get, I think, 125 million USDC, right? But the price setters at like right now it's 98.5 is at 50 and then going so and so. Forth. Right. Things like that, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So we are like. So essentially, I think. I think that's fair to me. That's fair. You know? But remember, we actually took a pretty big risk in pricing at 0.47.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Actually we should price it lower.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, because that would have, that will actually have reduced the. But again, I think I regret over compensating for bots because there was so many bots on social media, they're bragging that they're going to retire audio and shit, you know. Right. So I think, no, no, seriously. So I was like, okay, fuck it.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think I wanted to avoid the nightmare of, like, having the early thing all been gobbled up, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But on hindsight, I feel like I could have done, like, 0.252.5 and they'll be fine, you know? Yeah. So I think. I think. But I'll give this project, I'll give the advice to projects.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, in the future, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Because I think. I think we did, actually. Yeah. That's how I think about it. Yeah.
Speaker A: So at the end of the seven days, do you have any. What are your plans? Are you gonna, when you have the window open to take liquidity, are you just going to take, like, what are the, what are the plans here? Are you going to take all of it or, like, a little bit? Like, what's the deal?
Speaker B: I don't know yet. I don't know yet. No plans? I don't know yet. No plans yet. I feel like. But I think what I'll do is that I'll communicate very clearly what I'm going to do. You know? I think, I feel like, I feel like the important thing here is for me not to stand in right now. Right now. But I don't know where it's going to be at.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: If it's at 0.7 and 0.4, it's very simple plans. But then, so I think that's, that's very nice. I feel like that's the nice thing about this model, right. It's that you are literally letting the market do things decide for you.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, before you actually push down.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I think. I think it's great. Any long, long story short is that. Long story short is that. I don't know. Because I don't know. I can set the ad right. It could be 0.40.5 or 0.7, I don't know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But one thing's for sure. I think. I think one thing is for sure is that um, uh, I I'm not going to sell a single troop. Okay. Any troop that's not sold right now will go right back into the. And you stay there. Okay. And. Okay.
Speaker A: And.
Speaker B: But obviously, if I. If I, .4 I don't sell anything.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, that might need to do some, that might do some OTC.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Obviously, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, but I'll be open about it. I'll be like, hey, I didn't, I didn't get any, I didn't get any stables here.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: No. I'll need to see here. I think. I think. I think the community will understand, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know? Yeah, it's fine, you know. Right. But obviously, at, .7 that I might do something else. So I think, all depends. So I think. But what I'll do is iceberg, once I have a clear signal of, like, what it's going to be, you know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Then I think I will over communicate, you know, I learned my lesson. You know, things like that.
Speaker A: Let's talk about the load on the Solana network. So Solana didn't miss a block. It didn't go down, which is under, under stress, which is great. Uh, there were some failed transactions. There were, people were talking about not being able to get some of their transactions through. How, how would you, uh, give a report card a grade to the performance of the Solana network during the launch of, uh, of the token?
Speaker B: I mean, I would say it's great. I mean, I'll say it's great. I think, um. I'll say it's great. Um, I would say that, um, I would say that, um, Solana has improved a lot.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, through the days. Right. It's like, I think there was one. 1.17 was dropped recently, right? Actually, we actually tamped the joke launch to happen after 1.17 because there was actually a lot of improvements, including some algobacs and also some cpu limit improvements. I think 1.18 is coming out soon, which will really make the local fee markets a lot more effective. So I think, in many ways, I think it's very nice for us to stress that's network, ideally, every single launch pack with stress test network. What's actually interesting was that a lot of other things broke.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: For example? For example, for example, some wallets didn't work as well, and some of our systems, because we were overstressing the sound, our vice problem, we were overstressing our own rpcs, and they were trying to fill those orders. So we were stressing. But it's actually our bet because, for example, instead of, instead of like, pre caching a lot of the orders, because we knew what those orders were. So we could have, like, cache them beforehand and then like, execute them.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Instead we were like, fetching them real time.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Which created a system reload on our network as well. So we just fucked up a lot of things anyway. But. So I would say the network itself went pretty well. I will say that. I will say that, like, a lot of, like a lot of other, other infrastructure didn't work that well, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But it's good.
Speaker A: Okay, so the core of Solana, which is the actual Solana network, did just fine. Maybe the next concentric circle out, which is the RPC layer around Solana, still.
Speaker B: Needs some improvement, more like how people use rpcs. Rpcs are fine, but how, how people use that fine, like they didn't scale up appropriately or the load balance didn't work properly. Things like that.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And a core network thing, I would say that, like, there's still some errors in terms of, like, this. It's still hard to estimate guessde, like, what's the right guys to use, you know? Right. But generally speaking, I think the core network went up, went out pretty well. You know, like everything sort of expired, obviously, right now. And there were. But, but remember this, right. What was actually interesting was this, because we priced at 0.4, right. Which is a level that people that like Jupiter would buy but not something that spammer bots would necessarily buy. Right. So we didn't, we didn't actually get as aggressive if we went like. Because originally one 10th of my utopian. Originally my utopian idea was to start one 10th. Let's go.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But 110 will be. 110 will actually be a lot of, like, a lot. Then we get spam like crazy.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: In many ways. Right. So I think that's the reason. Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay, so at the end of this seven day period, in theory, the Jupiter team will have capital, be able to enter the next phase of Jupiter team.
Speaker B: Hopefully.
Speaker A: Hopefully, yeah. Right. In the ideal scenario, this is like the plan. Like, there are some edge conditions we can talk about, but just like, the whole idea is, like, Jupiter now has capital to enter the next phase of its development. What are the next phases for Jupiter? What does the roadmap look like moving forward?
Speaker B: I think, first of all, I think it's what improving infra, right. Our core products.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I think, I think, I mean, a lot of things are incredibly boring, by the way. Like we scale up our customer support team.
Speaker A: People love teams with customer support teams in crypto.
Speaker B: I spent one month on this shit, man. It's not easy. Everything making sure everything is in, getting right people in and stuff. Like. So, I mean, like some fucking stupid shit, man. It's like, absolutely. I'm not kidding. I'm not fucking kidding, man. I spent so much time on stupid shit, what people might consider not exciting.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know?
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But to me, like, to me, we are very proud of this, right? We reply to everything. So we spend time on, like. And we also need. We also need people who actually can answer questions, can reprobate chains.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: And I think. I think having a high EQ, so I'm going to be pretty boring. Okay. So bear with me. Okay. But one of my big goals is to have a high EQ, high iq supporting that is able to work with the engineers and the users as well, because things get pretty fire away, and it's very technical. Might not know what they're doing. And then if you get into. So you need to have a high EQ to handle them, handle these complaints, but also high IQ to understand what's going on. So I think my goal is to have a high iq, high iq support team that is able to work through our products. Here's a problem if you don't have. And also to report the issue to engineers so they can actually see the problem. Because the reason is very simple. I feel like when we first started, we had very small number of users, so the user interfacing the engineers is good enough. But in this case, as the number of product scale and stuff, and the engineers remain relatively small, you can't do that. So what you need is that you need that layer to allow the users. To allow the engineers to still feel the pain, but also do that stuff. I think trying to build a layer is very, very important. So that's the first thing we do. Okay. I want to make sure that we have an extremely good, like, you know, like a community team, right. That's able to kind of like, you know, address community arrest, use complaints and things like that, right. Because I think, I mean, okay, looking at real money, right. I mean, real money here, you know, like, maybe to me, to ask, like, you know, higher bucks is not such a big deal.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, but to someone else, it's a huge deal.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And so I think we have to be careful. We have to be sensitive to that.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: That's something. But the second thing we're building is the second thing we're building is that I think we definitely want to improve our core products. We feel like we have, I feel like across our across swap limit order, DCA, gateway perks and launchpad, those are a very comprehensive set of features for the on chain exchange already. So I don't think the next step is so I think 90% of the effort would not be new products. Right. But just be okay making sure that those things are good and getting better.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, every single day, you know, so that's the second key focus.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And obviously we do actually want to experiment with this. Well, right. You know, so I think, and this, and this includes running, scaling our infra, you know, like infra and getting involved with Solana core.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Which is something that we haven't been able to do because we haven't had the capital to do it right now. But if you do. But if you do, well, if you do all with this initial launch.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Then we were definitely a capture to kind of like, you know, get a couple of in house people to work on sauna for Futam. Right, right. And also to also build up some question expertise as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, because actually, I personally have been very interested in questioning for a while now.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: I think, I think we are definitely going to focus 100% on Solana being the home, right, in our Jupiter, but sometimes there are many chains around.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So how do we kind of like better. And I'm not a chain, Maxi, by the way, you know, I'm not a chain, Max here. I do believe that focusing the product and ecosystem building on sauna is the right thing to do. And also, obviously I love the ecosystem.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: That'd be very nice to me at center. I think it's very important to connect with other ecosystems as well. Right. So trying to figure out what's the best way to do that is important for me. You know? So those are things that I want to have people attempt to work on as well. Yeah. So, you know, so those, so those two, three things like making sure that we scale up in terms of. So in summary, three things, right. I. The issue is still up in terms of the basics, right. You know, um, um, like the, the, and like the community. And to me, one important basic, that the engineers would grow because they need more people, so they will grow on their own.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But then what no one would, no one would explicitly do unless someone to really push that.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, it's this like community, uh, community support.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So I'm, so that's my focus then. And, you know, engineers do hire them. They will do their hiring. All right.
Speaker A: Okay. So the hiring. You guys are going to be hiring for a bunch of roles. If people are interested in those roles, what types of people are you looking for?
Speaker B: Different. Different, different. I think we are interested in, like, we're interested in people with proven. Like people with proven expertise in. I mean, there are two kinds.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: The first kind is that you can. The first kind, you are generally what you can learn.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And that's the. And then that's kind of the high. High EQ, high iq guys I was talking about.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: In this.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: So that's the first category, you know.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And very often those guys are sourced from a community, which tend to be great. I think that the second ones are those that have a proven expertise, whether it's in terms of, like, running infra. Like running high. Running high scale, like infra sonic infra.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Or having like. Or being like. Or contributed to the sauna core work right now. Right. So. So do those two sets of people. Yeah.
Speaker A: Beautiful. Well, meow. It's always a big day when you launch a token, so congrats on that. If people want to just learn more about Jupiter or maybe some ethereum people want to use Jupiter for the first time, where would you send people?
Speaker B: Okay, so thanks for asking. Appreciate it. Go to.
Speaker A: That's our site, j up ag, Jupiter aggregator. Is that what that is?
Speaker B: Yeah. And then, and then there's a gateway. And there's a, and then there's a gateway. There's a bridge or gateway link there you can go to. And over there you can find all of the different ways.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You can bring this one out.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: We have this comparator. Compare what's the best way between different bridges.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, to bring your in.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Or you can do it via credit card. Or you can do it via. Or can do it. Or you can bridge. I can bridge ethnic as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: And get some. So, but, so that. So we have a very comprehensive, comprehensive way for you to bridge this one.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and if you're interested in. If you're interested in learning more about the things I was discussing.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You can, you can check out my Twitter.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Or even offer more concise information. Look at. I talked on Twitter.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: But I can check out jup dot research.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and Jupiter research. I copied if research here. Okay. So it's literally jup r e a r e a r ch. Okay.
Speaker A: We'll get all these links into the show notes for listeners who just want.
Speaker B: To the Jupiter search is very sad because that's actually. Okay. I'm. I'm personally committed to doing two things. Okay. Uh, I'm personally. I'm actually very apologetic to, uh, for all the, um, the misunderstandings out there. So I'm personally apologetic for that. So I'm committed to writing to doing two things.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: To writing out a lot of the information into. Into the research post and also to post a simplified version. Okay. You know, on. On Twitter as well. So I'll do those two things.
Speaker A: Okay, well, meow, thank you so much. Where did the name meow come from?
Speaker B: Oh, my God. Okay, first of all, I wish. I love cats, you know?
Speaker A: Of course.
Speaker B: Yeah. The cat stuff. But, um, yeah, so, actually, my name is. My full name is actually very similar to meow. Very similar to meow. So it just came out together, you know? And then I think, uh, it's just fun, you know, because not everyone like founders, right? But everyone loves cats. No?
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker B: So, I mean, like, not everyone like tech bros.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, but I love cats. I said, okay, sure. It's more instrument.
Speaker A: All right, Mia, well, once again, congrats on the. The token launch and thanks for coming on the bankless. Bankless nation and telling us your story.
Speaker B: One more thing. Thank. Big fan of yours. So I really thank you so much for bridging. Bridging the two words. I know how hard it is for you to bridge the two words because I, you know, there's a lot of things going on, but really appreciate it for doing that, you know, and to everyone, ethereum, I would say that, like, you know, ethereum was my home for a long time. Right. You know, and I continue to really appreciate community. The research community is, like, way ahead of anybody else.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: You know, and the amount of, like, decentralized. Decentralization there is amazing as well.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Things like that, you know? So I continue to be a very big fan, you know, even though I do most. I would in Solana now. Yeah, of course.
Speaker A: Of course. Thanks, meow. Bankless nation. You guys know the deal. Crypto is risky. Defi is risky. New tokens are risky. Everything's risky here. But sometimes that's why we're here, because we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
