Like, effectively, alpha in a market comes from depth of understanding. If you can see the actual value of the thing. And there's a disconnect between perception and reality, right? So if the world thinks something is worth x, but it turns out to be worth two x, and there's that. That's a delta between perception and reality. And so what you really have to do as an investor, across all of the categories that you mentioned, picks and shovels. If you're an early stage equity investor, you know NFts themselves. If you're more of, like, an art curator, what you really have to do is understand the thing better than anybody else. You have to have some perspective on it that says, actually, reality is different than perception, and that's fundamentally what you're betting on."

This is Ryan Sean Adams, and I'm here to help you become more bankless. Yep, just me on the episode today. No David. He's off escaping to the mountains. If the AI tech was a little bit better, maybe he'd never miss an episode. I could just beam him in. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, so I had to take this episode on my own. The topic today is about bear market bets, investor conviction during the bear market. And one thing I'll say at the outset is nothing tests your conviction as an investor like a bear market. In particular a crypto bear market. I think they can be particularly deep and sinister. But if you look at this from the right angle, this is actually an opportunity. It's an opportunity to test what you think you know, to refine your thesis, your ideas, and to make your bets for the next leg up at a lower price point. So that is the topic for today. Avichal and Sanjay are longtime crypto investors. They're the guests in today's episode. They're also VC's at electric capital. And I ask them, what ideas are they betting on during this bear market? We discussed five of the most pressing questions, I think, that are facing all crypto investors during this bear market, including, number one, l, two tokens. These are layer two tokens. Are layer two tokens actually worth anything? Are they just worthless governance tokens? We get into that. Secondly, we talk about alternative layer ones. Will the ETH killers make a comeback this cycle or not? Number three, we talk about what a multi chain world really looks like. Will we have millions of layer twos and app chains, or will there be a few big winners? Number four, we talk about restaking. Is restaking a big deal? Is it overhyped? Will it pose an existential risk to Ethereum? And number five, Avichal explains why he thinks nfts are this cycle's altcoins and what he actually means by that. Also, toward the end of the episode, I get in a quick debate with Avichel on the money ness of ether. Ether the asset. He disagrees with me on that. I wish we had some more time for that debate, but we touch it briefly. Perhaps in another episode we can get into it in more detail. Last thing I'll say before we begin episodes like this are really an opportunity to sharpen your insights as a crypto investor so you don't have to take these ideas as gospel. Not everything that these investors say will be right. You, of course, have to wrestle with the ideas. You have to test them. You have to make them your own. And we'll have other bear market episodes with other perspectives. So this certainly isn't the last word. All right, guys, we're going to get right to the episode on Bear Market bets with Avital and Sanjay from Electric Capital. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including our number one recommended crypto exchange, bankless nation. I'm super excited to introduce you to our next guests, Avichal Garg and Sanjay Shah. Avichel is the founder of Electric capital, and Sanjay is one of the investors at the VC firm called Electric Capital. You probably know them from their incredible annual crypto developer report they put out every single year. The most recent, I think, was put out in January. I don't miss this measures all of the dev and dev activity across crypto. Vichel and Sanjay, welcome to Bankless."

And the reason bear markets are interesting to me is they are this fiery crucible where our investment ideas actually get tested, where we actually have an opportunity to kind of rebuild our ideas from the ground up and place our bets accordingly. So I want to ask a few questions today. I've got five teed up and then maybe some bonus questions. Questions if we get some time. I think these questions are some of the biggest, most important questions that crypto investors are asking during this bear market. So I want to get your thoughts on this, the thesis that you're sort of rebuilding during the bear market and really get a sense for your conviction what you're convicted on. Does that sound okay?"

But I'm going to tee these up, the first five, to give listeners a sneak peek into where we're headed. All right. The first question I want to ask is about layer two tokens. Are they worthless? Governance tokens is the question. Second question, I want to get into ETH. Will the ETH killers make a comeback alternative layer ones. Number three, I want to talk about layer twos. Are we going to live in a world where there's millions of chains or just a few big winners? Number four, I want to talk about restaking. Is restaking Eigen layer all of these things? Is it a big deal or is it overhyped? Is it an existential crisis for Ethereum? And then number five, nfts, man, they've been down bad recently. I don't know if you guys have noticed, but are they dead or will they make a comeback? So that's a little agenda item. I got some surprise bonus questions for you as well. Why don't we start, though, with the big question? I think part of the reason I wanted to have you both on the podcast is, Sanjay, you wrote fantastic blog post about layer two value capture. And let me just frame the question, and you put it nicely at the beginning of your post. The question is these layer two tokens worth many billions of dollars, double digit billions of dollars? I don't think triple digit billions of dollars. Are they actually worth anything right now, or are they just worthless governance tokens? I'll throw it to either one of you. How do you think about this question right now?"

So you always have to say, okay, let's look at this from a fundamental perspective and where the cash flow is going to come from. And I think that if you really dig deep into layer twos, there are very concrete sources that they can actually generate sustainable cash flows and sustainable profits. And so there is a real, and happy to sort of dig deeper into this, but just based on that idea alone, there is a real fundamental basis for why these tokens should have values based on cash flows."

Because if there's no cash flow coming out of the thing, then it's, what is the thing actually worth? And finance in general or investing in general, that's like the great normalizer. It's like, what are the cash flows coming out, and what kind of discount rate do I apply to that cash flow? And then I can start to normalize across things like bonds and stocks and tokens. And so I would add maybe two or three nuances or dimensions to this. So, one, just because a thing has cash flow doesn't make it a security. And I think this gets into a lot of nitty gritty about regulatory, but we firmly believe that there are ways to have cash flows coming out of these without necessarily making them securities."

I think it's important people not necessarily conflate cash flow with security. Those are actually two different things. Second is, I think what's really interesting about crypto is the global nature of it. And so the fact that there's so much capital all over the world that would like to be able to invest in cash flow assets or any sort of asset outside of their local fiat regime, and that's actually, for most of the world, is not possible. Like, most of the world can't easily access us equities, for example. Our belief is there's actually a lot of latent demand all over the world for these kinds of assets that are sort of, they exist outside any singular jurisdiction. Like ETH doesn't exist, only inside the United States. And that's actually what makes it so compelling, too, from, like, a global perspective, is that there are a lot of people who otherwise would not be able to participate, that can participate. And I think, you know, kind of back. You know, I think the framing that you had around conviction at the front end was really compelling. And I think one of the things that we have, we personally have not lost conviction on, but I think in the bull market really gets lost in the noise and tends to come back in the bear markets, is that that's fundamentally what this stuff is about. It's about empowering people all over the world to participate in these open systems. And that's what's so interesting about the l two s, is there are actually ways for people to participate all over the world and capture value in that in a way that doesn't make them security, but still has cash flow, which I think is actually. That's like, one of the interesting breakthroughs."

I'm a landlord. Well, that is a cash flow producing asset. That's not security. I don't have to register that thing with the SEC. There are tons of categories in the real world, pre crypto, that actually fit this mold of being a cash flow but not a security. How come people are so hung up on this?"

I think some people know this in conversations with senators and congresspeople and people at the White House and so on. And there are a lot of good people in the ecosystem that spend a lot of time behind the scenes on this stuff. And I think one of the challenges is that you don't want to bake technology solutions into the regulations. And every now and then, every 50 or 100 years, a new technology comes along, and it sort of breaks your mental model of what's possible. I think AI and crypto are kind of are going to both face this right now, because I'll give you one concrete example."

So anywhere there's a server thing can exist. And I think that creates a whole host of challenges, because our entire regulatory framework has been based around the notion of a nation state with physical geographic boundaries and capital controls. And this really starts to break a lot of that. AI is similar in all sorts of ways. Should an AI pay taxes? It's kind of unclear. And if it pays taxes, who does it pay taxes to? Because it can run on any server anywhere. What does that mean? Does the question even make sense? And this happens every now and then, and I've talked about this in other contexts, but, like, to me, crypto, like, the idea of this non jurisdictional coordination mechanism. The last time we really had to face something like this was with the invention of the joint stock corporation, which was like, 1650. It was like, oh, we can put money together and take risk without it being my personal property at risk. And before that, you just had the cottage industry. And so between, like, 1650 and 1850, we put a lot of regulations in place around how that should work. And it used to basically be that only kings could give you a charter to go start a corporation. And around 1850, we said, wait a second, that doesn't make any sense. Anybody should be able to start a corporation. And so we created entirely new regulation that said, oh, here's what it means to register a company. And that unlocked the industrial revolution. Like, the reason railroads could get built is because a bunch of people could pool capital at a scale that wasn't previously possible from one humanity. And I actually think a lot of crypto and AI, it's like the first time in 150 or 200 years that we've had to face this kind of a problem, which is like, it just breaks our existing model of regulation in a lot of fundamental ways, and so we need to rethink it. I know that's, like, super high level meta, but that, to me, is what makes this so interesting, because the properties of this stuff are truly Internet native in a way that I don't think we've ever experienced before. And that creates a whole host of challenges downstream, one of which is, well, how can you have a cash flow entity that a bunch of people participate in, that I can track that. I know exactly what my cash flow stream is going to be, but it's not a security. And I think that's one of the side effects of this new technology."

But I don't know that's exactly comforting, that it took us about 200 years from the joint stock company, first joint stock company to get the regulation in order. I hope crypto can happen at a. We'll get to that, too, but. Okay, so, bull case, I think what you just gave was sort of the bull case for maybe these capital assets that are tokens in general, which is they're global, they're digital, they're cash flow producing assets that aren't security. Anyone with an Internet connection can own one of these things. Well, how cool is that? There's another piece here, though, that I want to get to is just because there is a token out there that can accrue value doesn't mean it's sort of set up to actually accrue value. So this idea of cash flows is like, where does the revenue come from for a layer two? Maybe you guys could give us a refresher. Sanjay, you could give us a refresher on how rollups make money today. How do they actually generate revenue?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. So today, rollups. So in the future, rollups, I think, will generate value from two different streams, MEV and transaction fees. Today, roll ups don't actually generate any revenues from MEV because the sequencers are centralized. So, optimism. Arbitrum. And of course, they don't want to be extractive to their users, so they've decided, hey, we're not going to extract any MEV."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So they've just turned it off, basically, yeah. As a centralized sequencer, they could charge some fees for MEV and for transaction fees, but they've just set it to zero right now."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Is that correct for MeV? Yes. And then, of course, they are charging transaction fees. And so that's the primary source of revenue today for layer two s. So that's today and in the future. So I think there's a. So let's speak to both sides of those. So for the MEV that can be turned on in the future, and I think that could be a sizable form of revenue for, for rollups. In the blog post, I sort of put a little bit of a framing around this. So there's sort of like good Mev and bad Mev and good, harmful MeV is anything that's harmful to the user. So let's say a sandwich attack, etcetera. And bad Mev is. Yeah, exactly. Thank you for bringing this up. And then sort of bad MeV is. Good Mev is something that actually you know, helps the ecosystem. So, for example, an arbitrage helps keep prices consistent across different dexs. And so sort of my view is that as far as Mev, I think the harmful sort of MeV will ultimately be sort of either mitigated or rebated back to users. And sort of like, why do I say that? Well, one, businesses, there's like a line I have in the post, which is like, typically businesses don't really gain adoption by screwing their users. That's not a good strategy. And so I think it's the same way with blockchains. And so there's sort of incentive at every layer of this, whether it's talking about wallets, whether you're talking about the roll ups themselves, whether you're talking about shared sequencers. Like, hey, let's figure out a way to get rid of these sandwich attacks. Let's figure out a way to sort of mitigate this harmful sort of form of MeV. And I think right now there's like twelve different projects that are working on trying to do this. I think with so many people working on this, I feel fairly good that we're going to figure out a way to combat that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Okay, so let's break this down a little bit for people and spend some more time on kind of definitions to make sure we've got everyone with us today. So you think that the sources of revenue for rollups, the way they make money, are two form MeV and transaction fees. And then we just went into MeV for a second, defining MeV for a second. This is basically block ordering. There's some value for anyone who's sending a transaction or doing something on chain on one of these layer twos and getting their transaction in first. It turns out that we can sell that value, and layer twos indeed can in the future, start selling that value. I believe that's what you're saying here. There are two forms of not the selling of that value, but I guess maybe the effect of blockchain ordering, maybe you can find better words for this one, is there's harmful blockchain ordering, so you're calling that harmful meV, and then there's good MeV. And what you're saying, sanjay, is you think that the harmful MeV will actually be mitigated over time so that the layer two designers will effectively try to minimize that as much as possible and or rebate it to users. So if you're a user in metamask, you're committing a transaction. There's some future world where you actually receive some, the proceeds of that transaction in the form of a rebate, you get kind of your Mev money back. That's what you think will happen to harmful, the good MeV. You think these layer twos will effectively take in the form of revenue under that MEV category, is that right so far, what would you add to those definitions? And also, can you give us some examples of harmful versus good meV?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, so that's exactly right. I think you phrased it really well. So let me give you an example of harmful MeV is like a sandwich attack. So, for example, you want to go and you want to buy an asset on a Dex, let's say ether. Someone sees you're going to your trade incoming, they're going to actually put in in order to trade that asset ahead of you, and then your order will actually push the price up, and then on the back of that, they'll actually sell what they bought. So they've just made money sort of risk free, and you as a user, you've actually gotten to execute at a worse price. So that's probably the most common, prominent example of harmful MeV. And then as far as sort of good or beneficial MeV, like one example is just arbitrage. So, you know, if you have different dexs on a roll up or across roll ups, you obviously want prices to be the same or consistent across the different, the different dexs. That's good for users. Liquidations is another example of beneficial MeV. You want people to get liquidated as soon as possible, which helps the protocols not accrue bad debt. The faster that can happen, the better. That's another example of beneficial MeV. One good example is how I see this playing out. There's a new shared sequencer radius that has come out in the last couple of months, and they're implementing this thing where they're using encryption to actually block this harmful MeV. So using encryption, nobody can see what your transactions are. And then after some transactions are finalized, then they're actually running an auction to allow people to backrun these transactions. They're essentially blocking the front running of transactions, which allow for the sandwiches, et cetera. And they're running an auction to optimize the back running of the transactions, which allow for arbitrage and liquidations, et cetera. So in line with this framework that."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I've laid out, so how does this MeV, we'll talk about transaction fees as the other pocket of revenue in a second, but just for MeV in general right now, kind of, you said the sequencers are kind of centralized, haven't turned the dials on. So no one's actually charging for this in the future they could, but how does this get to value in the token? If you're a token holder of something like the arbitrum token or the optimism token or something like that, how do you experience that value? One way in the ethereum ecosystem that holders experience value is through EIP 15 five nine, the burn, effectively where supply is kind of destroyed. In the world of capital assets, I mentioned property that I might hold and I might get a rental income from that. So my asset actually generates income that I can take home. Yeah, it's not quite a dividend, but it's sort of a dividend, I suppose. Can an arbor optimism or layer two token holder expect to sort of receive this as a share of income? Or is it burnt, or is there some other mechanism at play here to actually link the token itself to this value creation mechanism?"

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I think any of the above and I think different layer twos are going to experiment with different models. So you could burn it, you could give it as a dividend, you could invest it in retroactive public goods, which ostensibly will then increase the value on the protocol. Further, how I expect it to happen in practice is through some sort of auction mechanism. Right now you have a centralized sequencer and so it's sort of up to the goodwill, I guess, of the sequencer to give that back. But I think, and how much to give back inevitably. I think that once you have auctions, just like you have at the proposal layer on Ethereum, where builders are actually competing to get proposers to choose their block. In the same way, I think you'll have people competing to build a block and then that value will then go back to the protocol and they can choose what to do with it, what they want."

So how do layer twos today charge transaction fees inside of their ecosystems? Im going to pull up a screen just to kind of start this conversation. I believe that was in your blog post. This is arbitrum annualized revenue. If youve never looked at arbitrum from this perspective, I encourage you, this is the way that investors should and are looking at this. This is, I believe, a set of metrics from May of this year. And this says arbitrum annualized revenue. If you annualize arbitrum's revenue in May of 2023. This is in a bear market, mind you. We get 115 million in annualized revenue. Revenue being the term for the top line. Right. So this is not necessarily profit. We can talk about the costs of the arbitrum business, if that's. Or a capital asset, if that's what we want to call it. But revenue, $115 million. And I believe this is from transaction fees. Can you explain this a little bit, Sanjay?"

Essentially, the data availability? And then there's sort of an l two operational cost, essentially. Like, how much are they, how much does it cost to actually operate the chain, et cetera? And then there's an l two gas fee, which essentially makes up the transaction fee. So that's how the revenue model works today. And it's broken down into these three chunks. I think the way that it can be broken down in the future can sort of be different. Like, it doesn't actually have to be on a menu where here's your l one cost, here's your l two operating cost, here's your l two fee.

        "speaker": "C",

I think one of the mental models that I wanted to at least put out there with this is that I think some people think, okay, EIP 4844 is coming. Block space is going to drastically reduce. And so as a result of that, okay, yeah, arbitram's revenues look great right now, but that's just because l one data fees are super expensive right now. And once l one data fees plummet, like, hey, arbitrum's revenues are going to go down the toilet because maybe they're just making a ten or 15% margin on top of what the l one is charging. And sort of the model that we can get into it that I at least sort of propose here is, hey, that's not actually true because there's actually, some block space that's actually valuable on the l two. And they don't actually have to price it at just like a 50 fixed percentage above what the l one block space is. So as an example, if you getting coffee at Starbucks, just because it costs Starbucks ten cents to make it, that doesn't mean you're paying $0.10 or $0.11. You could be paying $5 or $10 for a cup of coffee. I think it's going to essentially be similar in the l two block space. I think you guys have a pretty famous saying which is blockchain, sell block space. I think it's very similar to l two block space as well."

        "text": "Yeah, I think a lot of people don't understand how layer twos actually make money and how much value is created here. Avichal, I wonder from your perspective, what this sort of looks like. Right. So there are multiple analogs that we could use. Yes. We have said on bank list many times is a mental model. Blockchains sell blocks. That's the thing that they do. Just because it's a simplification. I feel like so many times the crypto investing world gets stuck on narrative value, meme value. And it's helpful to view this as almost like a company. Right. So what does Apple sell? They sell iPhones. Right. How do they create value? Well, they take all of these commodity type components and they create an incredible user experience in a phone that you can use and apps that give value to everyday life. And they're able to charge $1,000 per phone. Right. It's kind of amazing. And so looking at these layer twos, almost as kind of like companies, they're not securities, but maybe from the perspective of there is something that all of them are trying to sell. They're trying to make their block space as valuable as possible. And to Sanjay's point, they can charge whatever they want for that, whatever the market is willing to pay. And so that's one model of looking at it. The other way to look at it, though, is as an emerging economy. It's almost like the nation state type model. Right. And if, you know, another analog we've used is think of like a province in a nation or like a state in the United States, the state of California. And it is kind of, there's a federal government. That federal government in the lt world is maybe Ethereum has its own currency, but then there's a state's economy, the state of California, it can create value. So you're almost valuing as an emerging economy. Make sense of this. How do you think of layer twos?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, so two thoughts on this. So I think your second point around thinking of these things as digital countries and states is exactly right. That's very much the conclusion I've come to. We wrote a paper about Ethereum as a digital country a few years ago, and sort of as a little bit of a detour into that for a second. I think that's actually what the, like, if you think about what the world wants and kind of what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine and the US flipped on sanctions, what the world kind of realized was that the economy of the world, international trade, commodities trade, pricing, all this stuff runs on us dollars, but ultimately the US can shut you out of that economy if they feel like it. And that's really scary, right? If you're Turkey, if you're India, if you're Brazil. And so what the world actually wants is a US dollar denominated system, because they don't necessarily want to be beholden to the chinese government either and denominate things in CNY. And you're seeing a little bit of a move towards that. And so what the world actually wants is a US dollar denominated system that the us government cannot unilaterally shut them out of that's effectively credibly neutral and sufficiently decentralized such that you can get the bad actors, but that you can't be shut out unilaterally. And that's effectively what ethereum is becoming. And so our sort of, like, long term view on this is ethereum is slowly evolving into this third space, which is not the US space, which is not the chinese space, but is this sort of credibly neutral, decentralized space. And I think your analogy of, if that's kind of like the federal government in a sense, or that's the country, then l two s start to behave a little bit like states. And if you think about how a state like California operates and what they're able to do, in effect, why does California have such high taxes? Or why can apple charge a 30% tax? It's because they have pricing power. So the general term for this of it not collapsing to the commodity price of the compute power on the thing, which is, I think, a thing that a lot of technologists and economists both miss. Like, they think of these things as purely computational networks and therefore they don't have pricing power. But there are forms of pricing power that states and companies have, which are really interesting, right? So, like, for example, California essentially having a monopoly on useful coastline on the west coast, like all these beautiful beaches and Big Sur, and it's just, it's a beautiful place to live, means that real estate is tremendously valuable. And as a result, there's this like source of income which they effectively have a monopoly on, which allows them to do a lot of other things. Or there's brand value, like why do people pay for an eight dollar cup of coffee? Why do they go to blue bottle? Yeah, it tastes better. But part of it is the experience. Part of it is the brand, part of it is the ethos. You're holding the cup, you're being seen by other people. There are these emotional motivators, or there are network effects. Silicon Valley is a network effect around capital, which has been written about many, many times. Entrepreneurs will generally relocate to where they can get great capital. And there's so much tribal knowledge about how to build companies in Silicon Valley that it's not a surprise that network effect continues to perpetuate. Crypto being a really interesting counter example we could talk about. If you look at the l two s, they kind of have all of these. There are network effects in terms of defi all being on arbitrum right now, or there are technical motes. Actually building an iPhone is really hard. You look at something like starkware and you might argue that that's a real technical moat. There's just not that many people that could build a ZK based system or Zksync. You look at brand effects, and so if all the cool kids are in one place for the nfts, then that's where all the nfts will be, that's where the creators will want to be. So there are going to be these different forms of pricing power that these networks have on top of the l one. That's going to allow them to have some spread there, I think. And I actually really, I hadn't heard somebody talk about it as a state on top of the federal government, but I think that's a great analogy. And I think states like California or New York or Washington, DC, where you have this combination of network effects because of the industries that are there, the company towns, effectively the brand value, it's like if you want to do anything in government, you have to be in DC. That's where the network is, that's where the flow is, and that gives them pricing power. And I think l two s will behave very similarly."

So I think what you're saying is that layer twos are a bit more like California than they are like Apple. But where that, I think that mental model falls apart for people is there's no way right now to invest in California tokens. Like, how would I even do, how would I invest in the California economy? Right."

Like, I wonder if there was some sort of composed asset that gave you an index of all of California's property assets, let's say, for instance, and then also the s and P five, like the number of publicly traded companies that were all based in California, something like that. That could almost give you a proxy for, like, what an investment in California would look like. But we don't really have that at the state level or even at the nation state level. I guess the best proxy for investing in the United States is probably buying the s and P or something like that, or Nasdaq, something like that. But you sure wouldn't want to buy the dollar. So maybe that's what we're saying. You guys are saying these l two tokens are, they're effectively, they're an investment in this emerging network state, let's call it. And just like, if you live in California and they're not providing the services, it's not worth it. Network effects aren't worth it. You can defect and you can move to Texas, for example. Well, all of the different layer twos are competitive with one another, and they have to provide the network effect, the services or the population, the applications on top will kind of defect. I think the analog kind of holds. So is this making sense? Are we stretching the metaphor too far?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, it's a little bit stretched. And I mean, it is, it's one of the things that's generally tricky about technology. Early stage technology is like, we have to reason through analogy and skeuomorphically, like, if you remember, the original iPhone apps were all kind of like leather and paper. And it's because that's, like, all we were used to when it came to touch. And so we're like, well, if it's a flat screen, let's make it look like paper and leather, but that just, like, doesn't make any sense, actually. So I think it is a little bit stretched. But, you know, I think analogs are still illustrative. They can still teach you things. So I do think there's a lot to that. I think the idea that there are network effects, the idea that there is a notion of brand, there's community, there's cultural alignment. And so by choosing to live in San Francisco, you're making a cultural statement about your values as much as you are physically where you choose to live. So I think a lot of those drivers will exist in l two s as well. And then I think your point around what is the ease of switching, given that all of these things are evm right now on top of ethereum and the ease of moving things around? I think at least in the early days, it's sort of like if I could effectively pick up and move to Nevada or Texas or Florida without having to uproot my entire family, and would I do that? I think a lot of people would actually consider doing that. So lowering the difference, I guess, here with the l two s is the switching cost is significantly lowered as the infrastructure gets better and better. I can just use optimism or arbitrum as an end user, or if I as a developer can just move my code because it's all EVM and it basically works the same way everywhere, then the switching costs are significantly lower than they are in the physical world."

In fact, for those saying that it's impossible to value different crypto assets, I think you guys are saying you can actually value this as a capital asset and forecast revenue and profit over time, and plug in the numbers and excel a spreadsheet and it'll give you the valuation.

You can figure out what your assumptions might be for that, what the costs are for running the network. And there's certainly a spreadsheet model that you could produce here that would produce positive cash flow out to token holders over some period of time. That doesn't necessarily make it a great investment. That doesn't necessarily mean that people should do it. It's extremely risky. But that's generally how we think about these things. If there isn't ultimately going to be cash flow coming out of it, the market in the long term will not value the thing."

There could be a world where we live in with millions of different chains and layer twos. Or there could be a world we live in where there are a few winners with kind of big network effects. Right? So which of those is the most likely outcome? Like, one is a world where we might have tons of app chains. There aren't any, really, too many generalized chains. I don't know if you could put some more color on that. But the other is a world where there's a few big mega chains that win. Like Defi NFT use cases, they all accrue to a couple of mega chains. We're sort of seeing that, I think, on the main chain, layer one side of things, but we'll get into that discussion next. What do you think? Millions of l two s or a few biggest winners? Vichel, what do you think about this?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, this is actually probably one of the things I've most changed my mind on over the last two years. I mistakenly assumed there would be some sort of power law, the way I think the l one s will have a power law where Etha is really big. Maybe the cosmos ecosystem can be big. Solana might be big, and you're gonna have a long tail. And I mistakenly assumed that the l two s would work that way. And the sort of belief I've come to is actually there are gonna be millions of l two s. There will be a relatively small number of generalized ones that are permissionless and open. But what I think optimism really did by open sourcing the op stack was they made it really easy for people to spin up their own instance of optimism while still being a part of the ecosystem. So you look at things like base, and as a result, I think what you're going to get is not just the truly open permissionless ones, you'll get everything from that to ecosystem chain. So I think they're probably going to be things that are like an NFT ecosystem chain. So to use Sanjay's analogy, maybe that's like the LA of Ethereum, right? And there will be like the KYC chain, where you have to KYC to get in. Maybe base wants to do that with Coinbase. I'm not implying anything, I don't have any inside information or anything, but you can certainly imagine Coinbase taking that killer asset that they have with 100 million KYC accounts and saying, hey, you can actually trade in a KYC way here. And that looks like tradfi, New York. You'll get these ecosystem ones all the way out to the other extreme of the only user of that l two is a specific application. So you essentially get an app chain, like the cosmos style. I have a game, and I want to control the sequencers, and I want to have those be hypercentralized to lower gas fees. And I just want interoperability with ethol one. And so I'm using all the same standards, like the same NFT standards, but I actually want to control it. And I think you'll get the full spectrum there. And so if you believe there could be millions of applications, then certainly all of a sudden you end up with millions of app chains."

Now it feels like we're moving towards the opposite world. We have all this block space, but we don't have enough apps to actually use it. Why do you think we're going to have all of these applications? Why millions of chains? How come all of these applications need their own chain?"

One more abstractly, it's interesting when you look at the history of available computational power, whether that's cpu or ram or hard drive space, whatever, it just gets sucked up as soon as you make it available. Some developer finds a way to use it. Quote that like, sixty four k of ram is enough for everybody, and you just don't need more than that. And here we are."

I'm sure he's a very smart guy, so he probably meant it in a different context or something. But the observation is like, how much faster are computers today, and how much slower do they feel than the 1990s? There's a great video that was circulating a couple weeks ago. I don't know if you saw this about Windows nt or Windows 3.1, and you look at the boot times and how quickly apps come up, and it's instant and it's slower today, even though computers are 10 million times more powerful. And so there's this property of computational markets, which is like, as soon as you give developers some computational resource, somebody will find a way to use it and break through somehow. And so you're just sort of perpetually sucking up all the available capacity. And so I suspect that will be the case here. If I had to guess, what is the initial set of use cases there? I think it's probably going to be games. I think often you see that in a lot of early platforms, and in some sense, Defi and NFT are games. They're actually just real world, real money games being played across the entire Internet. Rather than being played in some executable that you run on your computer. It's being played on Discord and Telegram and Twitter and in the real world at events, they're just games that we're playing. They're social games that we're playing."

That guy is basically like, makes money by selling you a $300 leather item for $3,000 because you're playing a social game. Like, what you're doing is converting capital, capital into social capital. And it turns out billions of humans want to play that game, and that's just a totally socially constructed game that all these people need to play. And hence, this is the richest man in the world. But it's hard, I think, for a lot of engineers and a lot of trad five rational. You look at finance analysis or economic analysis, and the center actor, and all of that is always, like, a rational adult. That's like, somebody who only behaves 100% rational.

It can be all of the use cases. Like, you know, what is buying property? Being a real estate agent in Manhattan, is that. Is that. Is that a game to acquire more and more kind of real estate tokens? I also find that, like, the best training I've had for crypto is actually playing video games. I've talked to many crypto investors who said something like similar.

So I think to think about that question, you first have to maybe drill down into what do you get by being on a general purpose chain, versus what is the advantage of being on a specific l two? When you're on a general purpose chain, like arbitrum, optimism. You get that asynchronous composability. That's key, especially for DeFi. But there are actually really big advantages to being on an app specific chain. You lose the interoperability. Well, not total interoperability, but you lose that asynchronous composability."

If you don't want your fee markets to be intertwined with the fee markets of all these other chains, you get that sort of isolation, and then you also get some level of protection from what the l two would do. So if you're an app on arbitrum, for example, and then arbitrum does some governance thing that you just think is a terrible decision, you're kind of stuck because you're an arbitrum now. You're dapp on Arbitrum, whereas if you're this app specific chain, you can actually then say, hey, I don't really agree with this. Maybe I'm going to move to optimism. You get a lot more flexibility that way. There are these clear, orthogonal trade offs, and I think some lend itself to the asynchronous composability means that there will be a set, especially like Defi, that will be on this general purpose roll up, and then there will be a lot of app specific l two s, because I do think that there are some clear advantages.

And the experience is different, different set of applications. It very much feels like moving to a new neighborhood, a new town. There's some friction in the UX. Do you think all of that gets abstracted away in the millions of chains? Because it feels like it would almost have to.

You've seen the ZK stack recently, Vision by Zksync, which allows for a lot more interoperability.

And so I do think that there could be a world in which these sort of super chains can also interoperate with each other, and the shared sequencers are sort of independent of these super chains. That's just a separate concept where multiple chains that are all speaking different languages can go there and interoperate."

I think a lot of the infrastructure significantly reduces the friction to moving between different things, and it becomes effectively a standard, and so then you can move assets around. I think there's a lot of work to do on the user experience. This is something we talk about a lot internally, and we've had, we've tweeted about and written about, is like, this is probably the big bottleneck now. It's actually the thing, like, at this point, if I think about going back to your highest order question about conviction, what is the thing that I worry about the most? Like, why won't crypto work? Like, why will the l two s not work? Why will Ethereum not become this third digital country? And so on and so on. I think the biggest risk is actually user experience, which is like, so many people can get exposed to this technology because everybody has a phone. There's now 5 billion phones in the world that if the guardrails aren't in place yet and there's too much friction. And people come in and they just lose their wallet, keys, or, like, you know, something bad happens that you could actually poison the well. And so actually, like, being able to get to a billion people overnight is as much a curse as it is a gift. And so I actually think if crypto were to not succeed, like, what's the bear case overall for all of this stuff just not working? I think it's actually that the UX burns people. Our ability to get people to try this thing is so far ahead of our ability to build good user experiences right now that we could actually burn a lot of people. And so I actually, it's funny, I basically have the opposite. I have the inverse concern as you, Ryan, which is like, I don't worry that the UX is going to prevent people from doing it. I actually think it's too easy to get into the flow of this stuff, and then you can get caught and you can lose your assets, and then that just burns you, and then you don't want to touch this stuff. We kind of have to cycle out an entire seven or ten years of people to forget the pain of having lost their money because the UX was bad."

I think there's a chance that they get really big in the next cycle and they come back. But my concern would be that if, like, it's too easy to get into the NFT world and it's too easy for money to flow in there, that actually, people will get burned before we have the guardrails in place, which is the other side of ux. Like, it has to be, basically, it has to be easy to use this stuff, but we also have to put the safety measures in place so that people can't just lose all their money and lose the private keys and need password recovery. And you need to have ways for it to be decentralized, that decentralized guys can't just be opaque about what they're doing and take a bunch of risk and lose all your money. I actually worry about the other side of it. If it's too easy to use, a lot of people may just get burned. So there's a really difficult tension here. You want this stuff to be easy to use but in very particular ways and still let people protect themselves. And I actually think if, if the stuff becomes a little too easy to use that, that people may just get burned. Um, like it. I kind of, I kind of like the, the sort of contrarian take I have a little bit is like, I kind of hope we have a long bear market because the longer. What's like like three years, right? We're already 18 months into it. But the reason is that, like, if you start to your point, right, if you look at the quality of experiences that are being produced today, like every six to twelve months, the user experiences get better and better and it gets easier and easier to use this stuff without totally burning yourself. So Coinbase's NPC mobile wallet is actually pretty good, or institutional custody is way better than it was even 18 months ago. You have companies like fortify and so I think if we give people another 18 months or 24 months to actually make these experiences good and safe, then we have a shot at not burning people and poisoning the well. So I'm actually kind of like, I kind of secretly hope that we just have this sideways burn for another two years so that we can build really good experiences so that when you look at chat GPT, it went zero to 100 million people basically overnight in 30 days. I'm not at all worried about whether or not people show up here because there's so much utility. And so I just want it to be really good and easy and safe when people actually show up when we."

And so if you look at just, you know, like 20 years ago, there were these graphs that used to circulate that was like, hey, here's how little time is spent on newspapers. But look at all the ad dollars on newspapers, and here's how much, look at all this time being spent on the Internet, and look at how little money is being spent on online ads. And you're like, okay, well, that just has to reconcile, like, over the next decade, that's just going to fix itself. The ad dollars are going to go where, where the people are.

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And it's not only is it more important, but it's actually from a utilitarian perspective, it's more efficient. So think about the math here. Let's say you're going to buy $200,000 Patek grand complications, and it's on your wrist. How many people are going to see it on your wrist? Like maybe 10,000 people over the life of you having that watch are going to see it and spot it and say, oh, that's a $200,000 watch. And so that's effectively $20 CPA, like per conversion of person that sees it. And now you get their social capital. Now it's a very particular group of people, and you might want that group's approval, but it's effectively $20 CPA. If instead you buy and spend $200,000 on digital items, whether that's skins and Fortnite or NFTs on your Twitter profile, PFPs or whatever else, a million people could see it on your Twitter profile, no problem. You have one tweet that goes viral and a million people will see that tweet and they see your picture. So it's effectively $0.20 an impression. So it's literally 100 x more efficient to accrue social capital using digital goods versus physical goods. And one of the really interesting properties with digital markets tends to be that because of the friction being lowered so significantly relative to physical, the market sizes tend to be much, much larger. And so if you look at, take Uber versus taxis, the big knock against Uber at the Series A was, well, if the entire taxi industry is only worth 10 billion, how could you possibly be worth more than 10 billion? And here we are, and you have Uber and Lyft and Didi and Grab. And like all these companies all over the world, that in aggregate are worth more than 100 billion. And so my opinion actually is that if you think LVMH and Nike and Rolex and Tiffany, these are monster brands in the offline world, that actually, by opening up brand and opening up luxury and opening up social signaling digitally, that could actually be ten x bigger. And so what we now have is this shared infrastructure to be able to do that. And so every game is going to use NFTs because it's just better to use them. It's just interoperable with every game now. So you can recruit other people to come in, every brand is going to do NFT drops because it's actually 100% gross margin. Like Nike just minted $20 million for doing some digital art. And then they did this Fortnite thing where you can see Nike apparel in Fortnite. LVMH is going to do this. It's just lower cost of production of the item and people are still willing to pay whatever they pay for it because the brand value and you now have a direct pipe to your fans. So like Nike or LVMH or Tiffany, know who their biggest fans are, their most loyal fan base because they're seeing them and they have a direct pipe to them. They can actually talk to them directly. And there's now an advertising network that gets built on the back of that. So I can look on chain and I can figure out exactly which people are actually the superfans of Nike or the superfans of Rolex. And if I want to do a collab or if I want to try to recruit those people, instead of me going to Facebook and paying the ad network to acquire another mobile app install for a game or for a key type of customer, I can just incentivize that customer. I can just say, hey look, if you show up and you prove to me that you've spent this much money on these types of goods or that you've spent, you know, you bought ten pairs of Nike goods or you spent a bunch of time in Roblox and you can cryptographically prove that to me, I'll just give you something in my, in my ecosystem I'll just give you a free digital good worth $1,000 and now you're actually paying the end user to come use your thing. So you start playing this out. And so it's not just like that, it's more utilitarian as a starting point, but like the interoperability and then the network that you build around everybody doing this on top of one standard and one network itself creates five to ten x more value. In my opinion. The downstream effect of this is just all of this digital goods spending I think just moves digital over the next ten to 20 years. And the beneficiary is the whole ecosystem actually, because you can now build a network effect around all these people doing it on top of one standard."

Like effectively alpha in a market comes from depth of understanding, if you can see the actual value of the thing. And there's a disconnect between perception and reality, right? So if the world thinks something is worth x, but it turns out to be worth two x, and that's a delta between perception and reality. And so what you really have to do as an investor across all of the categories that you mentioned, picks and shovels. If you're an early stage equity investor, nfTs themselves, if you're more of like an art curator, what you really have to do is understand the thing better than anybody else. You have to have some perspective on it that says actually reality is different than perception. And that's fundamentally what you're betting on. And there are a million different ways to do that. Art curators and collectors can be wildly successful people who invest in picks and shovels can be wildly successful people who maybe you say, hey, I think there are certain brands that are really going to benefit from this. I should just go buy stock, public stock in companies. And you looked at if you really understood AiHdenhe five or seven years ago, maybe you just bought up a bunch of Nvidia when it was down big time. And that's how you sort of played that market.

And if everybody were a great investor, especially with really high risk, highly volatile assets, then everybody would be rich, right? Like, and it turns out it's really hard to make money doing these things. And so actually, I think most people should not be looking at this as an investment buy for the art like, buy it for the community. Buy it because it brings you joy, size those things so that, like, if you lose a little bit of money because you bought the art and you supported some artists that you really believe in, then you don't feel bad about it. You're like, well, the whole point was to support, like, I am subscribed to, like, some patreons, and it's like, I've forgotten how much it is, but it's just because they're like these people creating great content. I'm just like, yeah, $5 a month. Let me just chip in. And I don't think about it, it right. That's, I think, the right lens that most people should have on it. And if somebody does want to become an investor, I think one of the things you have to learn is that discipline of, like, how do you size your positions appropriately? How do you not take undue risk? Like, rule number one is don't blow up. And if you're taking so much risk that you're going to implode, then you won't be here. And that's, again, it's not financial advice. I actually think most people should not be investing in this stuff. I think most people should not be trying to think of it as an investment because you're probably going to lose your money. But if you're going to go down that path, size it appropriately, and it goes back to this idea of, like, what do you like? Great startups and great early stage investing and great early market intuition. And I think, you know, nfts are very early market. It's based on some secret. Like, you have to understand something that's true that other people haven't figured out. That's true. And if you don't know what that secret is, then you don't know the secret. And if you don't know that insight, then you probably shouldn't be investing. The poker equivalent of that is if you look around the table and you don't know who the sucker is, then you're the sucker. That's the poker equivalent.

But you could wait a few years, and then maybe what emerges is sort of like a blue chip layer of sort of nfts. Like, if you just think about cryptos in general, right? Like, you as an investor on the sideline, you can say, well, I'm going to invest in, like, bitcoin and eth, and, like, those can be like my holdings.

Holding on for ten years was hard, right? The patience is the hard part, or a lot of times when you see a lot of activity happening, not investing is the hard part, until you really have conviction on a thing. And I suspect if this stuff works, the markets are going to be much, much, much larger. It's just like the Internet. Nobody could have imagined. You go back to the year 2000 and you're like, hey, in 20 years, all of the world's largest companies are going to be Internet companies. Would have been sort of unthinkable. Like, Apple is going to be a $3 trillion company when Steve Jobs comes back in the late nineties, and it's like a failing enterprise that's going to go bankrupt. These are just unthinkable statements. Patience, I think, is the key thing. And patience oriented towards how do you understand more deeply what's happening with the user, with the business, with the market, than anybody else? And only then should you really be thinking about investing. And I think that's usually the failing.

Like Solana, the cosmos, token avalanche, these sorts of things that had a massive run up. And now some of them are kind of in existential crisis mode, down bad, as we would say in crypto. And this brings kind of another question I wanted to ask you guys. Is the future, do you think there will be a contender for Ethereum's throne in the future? Will the Ethereum killers make a comeback as they have in previous cycles? And what about this broader question of modular versus monolithic chains? Bankless listeners will know, of course. Ethereum has taken the modular route with scaling via layer twos. There are other ecosystems that have taken kind of a modular route. They're a little bit different. Maybe cosmos is sort of one of those more modular. And then there's this question of monolithic chains of which Solana has maybe most famously gone in that direction. So what do you think about all of these questions? Alternative layer ones, eth killers are we going to have? You said that layer ones are more of a network effect game than layer twos? Are you sure about that? So let's dig into this. Vichal, what do you think?"

        "text": "So, zooming back on modular versus monolithic, I think Sanjay touched on this earlier. The fundamental trade off is, do you want real time composability or not intra block composability, the l one s, like Solana, give you this property, and sort of as soon as you start moving into l two s and you start fragmenting liquidity and execution, you lose that. Now you retain interoperability. And so there are a lot of use cases that are, you need the interoperability, but you don't need real time composability. But I think a lot of monolithic people would argue that that real time composability is like one of the killer features of these blockchain architectures. And so why would you give that up? You should really lean into that. And then the fundamental trade off you have to make is around decentralization. And so the monolithic argument, which I actually do think is compelling for certain kinds of use cases, is, can you be sufficiently decentralized to still be decentralized and censorship resistant even at state level, attack kind of censorship resistant while retaining composability. And that's an interesting design exercise. Can you design a blockchain that does that? And I think that's compelling because I think there are use cases that will want that set of trade offs. And so I think it's really good, from an ecosystem perspective for both of these things to exist and the search space to include both. And I think if you step back even to 100,000 foot view, part of the idea here, the whole reason this space was invented in the first place, was that centralization is not healthy. And if we end up with only ethereum, I think we have failed as a space, because that's not resilient at the ecosystem level. Ethereum can be resilient. But what if there are critical day zero issues with clients or with the EVM or. I worry that if we don't have multiple approaches, that we're not actually, as an ecosystem, being resilient. And I think that if we think of it as a non zero thing, which is like, well, they can both be successful. They could both be 100 x bigger than they are today. I think that's the right mindset on it. So I'm a huge fan of everybody trying to do both of these things. Or like the fact that Solana doesn't do EVM. I think that's awesome. I think that's actually really important to have a totally different technology tree that we're exploring, to use a video game term. I think that's really, really important for this space to survive and be thriving ten years from now. I don't think of Solana as an ETH killer. I think they both coexist and they just solve different problems with different ecosystems. And I think that's awesome. And so our approach has been they make different technical trade offs, applications and ecosystems will emerge that take advantage of those different trade offs, and they should both coexist, and they'll just solve different problems. And they can both be ridiculously successful as ecosystems and coexist."

Because if you're valued as a money, just the kind of the network effect game, the liquidity game, the economic security game, is tilted so much in your favor that you end up winning anyway.

Thought experiment here is like, well, if you look at Amazon's market cap, what percentage of Amazon's market cap is due to AWS or what percentage of Microsoft's market cap? If Azure were a standalone business, what would that be worth? I think it turns out that computational networks are extremely valuable at scale. Like all of Wall street and all of Tradfi were running on one platform that was 100% interoperable with each other. So every bank could immediately calculate how much leverage they have, and you could know exactly who owns which mortgages and mortgage backed securities, and that were all in one platform. That platform would be tremendously valuable. Now, this actually goes back, I think, to the l two question, which is like, what kind of pricing power does that l one need to have on top of that platform existing in one place? And I think if you think of it like a country, there are real network effects, and there's real brand value, and there's real the ability for a new application to launch and acquire a bunch of customers because the infrastructure exists. There's accounting tools and NPC wallets and distribution platforms for people to find users. Those things are real network effects that create pricing power. And so I think these things, if they're able to be successful, will be computational networks with pricing power on top of it. I don't think they collapse to zero, because I think network effects give you pricing power the same way that Apple or Facebook have it. So I don't think you have to have. You don't have to become base money. I don't think you have to compete with the us dollar. I don't think you have to compete with bitcoin. All you need is pricing power above the cost of running the network. That looks a little bit more like a company like Apple has pricing power, or Facebook has power because of the network effects. I think that's actually how these things will eventually operate, and then you'll have cash flow coming off of them. I think these things will extract some premium on top of the cost of running the computation and the cost of the block space, and the token holders can benefit from that."

The idea is for it to move slowly and not evolve, rather than a computational network that needs to evolve as a platform to acquire, keep acquiring developers. Bitcoin is ordinals is an elegant hack, but it's not a developer platform. That's really not what bitcoin is designed for. Bitcoin is designed to be more or less static and evolve very, very slowly. So I think it behaves a lot more like a base money or a lot more like a. Like a gold or a commodity. So I think you just have to value that differently. But I think that's a special case. Like, I think comparing bitcoin against Ethereum or, you know, these other computational networks, I think it sort of doesn't really lean into what makes bitcoin special and unique."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Maybe. One way to put it is I think there's this very binary approach that people have, which is either you have a monetary premium, or you're going to collapse to the price of running the computational network. And I think this is actually a legacy of sort of early bitcoin maximalism, like circa 2015. And there are some papers that were circulating around that time that people basically framed Ethereum as that, and they're like, look, if you don't have monetary premium, your token will just collapse to the price of running the network because it's a computational commodity. But I think there's this thing in the middle, which is if you have cash flow and you have pricing power due to network effects, then you don't have to be base money to get a monetary premium, and you're not going to collapse to the price of. Of running the computational network. And I think the open question is, how significant is that? Does that mean that you get a 15% margin on top of it? Does that mean you can charge two x what it costs you to run it? Can you? Where on that spectrum are you? I think is the open question. I think Ethereum is a great proof point for this, actually."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think I agree with that. There is a spectrum of moneyness and memetic value, and I do think that's more complicated to say something is competing as money or it's not. In reality, probably all assets are competing as a money. I mean, you just think of s and p 500 in stock. Is that competing as a store of value? Well, it sort of is my property. It sort of is as well. One last question for you, and then we'll kind of draw this to a close. So, restaking. Let's get to that really quick. Is it a big deal or is this overhyped? We've had some panels lately about the existential, I guess, threaten of staking, and some of the ethereum researchers actually think restaking poses some existential threats in the same way that MEV is. But let's take those issues separately. So first of all, restaking, is it a big deal or is it overhyped at this point? And then what do you think about the existential risk to underlying blockchains that have restaking on top of them?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, I think restaking is a big deal. Right. It's really hard to bootstrap a trust network. It's just one of the hardest things there is to do. And we've just seen that lots of chains have difficulty doing that. If you can take the existing trust of Ethereum and reuse that, I think that's a big deal. Now I maybe have a little bit of a nuanced opinion here, which is that rollups. So I think maybe what will play out is I think there's this sort of envisioning of like thousands of protocols maybe using these restaking layers. And I think that it may not actually play out like that, but I think it may be a few really big important protocols using these restaking layers. So as opposed to thousands of chains being restaked, it might be like twelve really important ones. And so like what are the things that could really benefit from restaking? A decentralized sequencing layer, a Da layer bridging. So there's a few really, really core use cases. And if you think about these use cases, they're massive. Like a scalable DA layer, that's a massive use case. A scalable sequencer layer that can basically support thousands of rollups. That's a huge use case. I'm super bullish on restaking as a means to provide decentralization beyond Ethereum to the broader ecosystem. Do I think it's going to, and it's going to be massively impactful. Do I think there's going to be thousands of protocols running on these restaking layers? That I probably think will not happen."

        "speaker": "A",

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I imagine you guys are also investors at some level in Ethereum, which brings up the question of existential risk to Ethereum for staking AvChel what do you think of that? I know you listened to the recent panel."

        "text": "Yeah. And Tim. Yeah, that was really, really good. That was a great conversation. Sriram did a great job too. And I think, yeah, kind of two thoughts. I agree with Sanjay. I think it's really probably a handful of use cases that are really critical for restaking. There's a question of do those start to get so large that they start to pose some sort of existential risk to Ethereum from that shared security cross. The answer is maybe it's kind of like TBD. I think it kind of goes back to people tend to think either people tend to have these sort of binary approaches to thinking about this stuff, and I think there's a messy middle a lot of times. And so I think there's a world where restaking gets big enough that it's interesting and useful, but not so big that it's existentially a threat. I also think that ecosystems tend to be pretty resilient. And so I suspect if it starts to get into that kind of existential risk territory, we'll figure it out. The ethereum ecosystem has been remarkably resilient about these kinds of existential risks and fixing them. And so I have a lot of faith in generally the ecosystem and the researchers and the developers and the community to sort of evolve and figure it out. And so we start getting to that point. I suspect there will be, I think, I can't remember if it was Justin or Tim, but somebody was talking about how would the protocol need to evolve to account for this, potentially? And so that might be a solution, or there may be things that you could do at the protocol level above Ethereum protocol. So I think if you look at liquid staking tokens, people talk about existential risk if it's all going through one protocol. And I think there are simple ways to mitigate that. There's multiple protocols, and you move your eth between multiple protocols or you do some self staking. I think there are ways to mitigate that. There's enough well informed actors at that base layer that basically the right things will happen. It feels to me like an inevitability. And if we get into sort of existential territory, if we're truly, it's so successful and so useful that you get into existential territory, I suspect the ecosystem will figure it out."

        "text": "Something else I think you have to understand at a deep level in order to understand the space, is that crypto is much more antifragile than I think the layman or the person looking at it from above things. I remember someone once told me that the reason they're not investing in bitcoin is because software has bugs. I'm a software engineer, and so what are the chances there's going to be some bug that expands the supply of bitcoin to, like hundreds of millions rather than 21 million? Right. What's interesting about this is as you dig in deeper, you realize, well, that's actually not what secures the bitcoin network. It's actually a social protocol. Like there's a layer zero here that would just fork that out and would continue running. And so if that's a reason not to invest, I think that's a mistaken reason. But you see that surface level. Well, guys, this has been so much fun. I want to close this out with a question related to the mood in crypto right now. And this is a tweet I put out, and I don't know if you agree with it or disagree, and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, but I'll give you a sense for the mood here. Crypto feels lost right now. That idea. Crypto is lost right now. And how can it find its way, was the question I posed. Do you think crypto is lost? This 2023 bear, market it. And if you do, how can it find its way out of Eachel? What do you think?"

        "text": "No, I think we know exactly what to do. Just like l one s need to scale, we need l two s to work, we need modular blockchains to work. We need stable coins. In DeFi, there's $120 billion of stable coins and 40 billion sitting in TVL and ETH protocols. That's about the 20th largest bank in the United States, which is very real. I tweeted a while ago that eBay at IPO was doing about $340 million of GMV NFTs do more than that today is what gross merchandise volume. So, like, total value of the goods that they'd sold. So eBay 96, when it IPO'd had done about 340 million, and bitcoin ordinals probably do more than that today in the depths of the bear market. And so, like, sentiment is very, very low and so it can feel bad, but when I look at the numbers, it's just, it's actually working. I mean, it's amazing. If you go back to 2017, there was all of this stuff that was theoretical. Like, hey, one day ethereum is going to move to proof of stake and we'll have l two s and we'll have stable coins, we'll have defi and we'll have these brands coming in and we might have an ETF and all this stuff. And it was all theoretical. ZK Pruce will work one day and all this stuff, NPC will happen one day and we'll have institutional custody and yada Yada governments will be crypto and all of that stuff was theoretical. And basically five or six years later, it's basically all true. Which just goes back to this adage of people way overestimate what's possible in two years and they dramatically underestimate what's possible in ten years. And so roughly halfway through that ten year cycle, we're basically where you'd expect, which is all the tech is now real. And so now it's just a question of how quickly does it get to people. So I definitely feel like we're down on sentiment. But like, on fundamentals, I've never been more optimistic. It's just like everything that was vaporware five years ago is actually real now."
