And it's because, like, I have these studio lights, um, for podcasting for whenever I want to do an in person podcast. But they are also, like, very powerful, uh, plant grow lights. Uh, and so I have them, like, turned on and pointed to my plants because, like, why the hell not? But then they're also really hot, and it's a solid 69 degrees in New York right now. Nice. Uh, and my apartment gets very, very sunny. And so I had to turn on my air conditioning in. What is it? Marsh?

I had the same conversation with micah Bolido on the podcast not too long ago when we were like, it was the beginning of the fourth inning. About is kind of what we said, but it also really depends on when you started counting the bull market. And I think we are in the beginning of the fourth inning if you count a very early bull market, and it's a very long game, I think really the Jito airdrop on Solana and then the Solana defi summer is kind of like the soft, official, unofficial launch of the bull market, if anyone can really put any date on it. But I think this thing could kind of, like, if the ETH ETF gets approved by November, of which the odds are still pretty good, I don't care what anyone says, that's just good. Continuation of more flows into crypto and the bitcoin ETF flows have potentially a ton of life in them, potentially three to six more months of net new buyers from different corners of tradfi coming in to buy bitcoin that has a ton of life and energy left in it to me. I'm calling for an idea. You have six to nine months where I. We have free paper gains because of all these inflows into the ETF's and everyone is speculating downstream. That being said, it doesn't matter how strong the fundamentals are, if there's too much total net paper gains in crypto, that will end the bull market because people will take the chips off the table and selling will beget selling and all of a sudden we'll discover a bear market."

Because I think with a lot of retail who comes speculating and de Jenning, they're not taking their entire savings and putting it into Dogwiff hat. They're putting amount of money that they can be nihilist about and see if it goes to zero, whatever. And I'm trying to shoot for the moon, and bitcoin is just not going to do that for them anymore.

And so all of those griffs are plenty real and plenty throughout the history of crypto. And so to the meme coin point, it's like, well, at least these things are honest. But I don't think that makes them any better or worse. I think it's a natural reflection on human incentive and human desires.

But then also taking your tradfi money and tradfi dollars and putting them into crypto and Defi is too risky for all the people that still have tradfi dollars. And so there's just like, that mismatch is producing very high yields where the curves or the supply demand curves actually meet. And that's meeting at 30%. This will attract outside capital.

So I need to actually do my homework on how this works. But basically there is a basis neutral trade that you can make where you have staked ETH on one side and the yield from staked ETH and MeV on Ethereum, which is something like four or five, 6%. And then you also have the yield of funding rates for people who are shorting Ethereum on a non leveraged leverage basis. And so, like, one way short, you get funding for that. One way long, you get yield from that. You put those two together and you have a basis trade where it nets out at like a $1, but you also get yield. And so that produces a stable coin. That part of the jump. I don't understand how it makes, but it does check out. I know that it checks out. Yeah. So they just crossed a billion dollars. So congratulations to Athena.

It's not that they are saying they're going to not approve it or they're not that they're saying that they're going to delay it. They are just doing nothing right. It's just like indifference. Jake Stravinsky says, it brings me no joy to be an ETH ETF bear, but I'm calling it like I see it. I see an SEC that dislikes crypto as a concept, seeks to please progressive elective officials. Shout out Elizabeth Warren, who wants to make anti crypto a core part of their platform. Who could that be? Has a wrong but not insane basis for denial. That is spot futures correlation. Now this, the spot price of ETH and the futures price of ETh on the CME futures, that is, like, mathematically been proven to have just as strong a correlation to the bitcoin ETF. So this point, this line in Jake and Jake's, like, reasoning people have, like, in the Ethereum community has called into question, like, we actually have, like, totally awesome, fine, fantastic proof that the correlation is just as strong as bitcoin. So, like, I'm not sure about that one, but, like, it does go back to the, I think just the writing the tea leaves is really just saying, like, the SEC is just, like, not engaging with ETH ETF issuers in the same way that they were engaging with bitcoin ETF issuers."

So Jake and Eric Balchunis, what about Blackrock? This is Jake's reply to that. I agree Blackrock's presence is a big deal, but ETH is a very unique asset and probably raises more legal and political controversy than any other ETF filing that BlackRock has ever done. Blackrock always wins is not a satisfactory response to all the arguments for denial, in his opinion. So."

So why was this upgrade so significant and what did it do?"

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So EIP 4844, which is like the shining star of the upgrade of the Denkun hard fork, is what introduces blob space to the Ethereum layer one protocol. Blob space is a specific lane of transactions that's separate from block space. So we have all the normal transactions that everyone has ever been making on Ethereum has always been going into block space. What do blockchains do? Blockchains sell blocks. Well, now, the Ethereum layer one also sells blobs. And blobs is a blob is kind of. It's actually a technical term, believe it or not, for just like, arbitrary data, we're going to package up arbitrary data and we're going to. That is a blob and we're going to put that blob in the layer one blob space. Think of it like a high occupancy vehicle lane and HOv lane for Ethereum layer two transactions. So on the Ethereum layer one, currently we're all driving in our individual cars, one car per person. Is not that efficient. And we're all having to pay high gas fees in order to do stuff on the Ethereum layer one, even layer twos are inside of the same kind of congested lanes that all the individuals are using now, layer twos, because they are high occupancy vehicles, they're bundling up thousands of transactions from thousands of users. They are, instead of posting that out as data inside a block space, they get to wrap that in a blob and post that into blob space. And so they all get to move faster through the carpool lanes and get from point a to point b faster for cheaper because of blob space. And so this actually is not affecting gas on the Ethereum layer one. For layer one transactors, this is significantly increasing the or decreasing the fees on Ethereum layer two. That's my summary. We've got blocks."

So this upgrade essentially made layer twos really, really cheap. And another way to phrase that is basically increase the capacity, increase the bandwidth of a layer two block space, essentially. So this is almost like us getting from the 1990s on the Internet to the two thousands you had dial up modem through your phone line. I mean, a lot of people don't remember that, but that's how the Internet used to be in the nineties. And then in the two thousands, we started to get high bandwidth systems. We started to get broadband, essentially, and we just did that in Ethereum overnight, phase one of increasing our broadband. So this is kind of Ethereum's broadband moment, I would say. And you're going to experience that not on Ethereum maintained. It's going to be just as expensive as ever. Fees are not going down ever on Ethereum.

Here is a chart of optimism of the median gas fee on op stack chains between op Mainnet, Zora and base, hovering around like ninety cents. And then now they are dropping down to somewhere between like one and $0.05. Liam from optimism says optimism just enabled 48, 44 a few minutes ago from $0.32 down to 0.00 $0.04 for a transaction that is optimism base is also a thing. This evening attracted the attention from Brian Armstrong because base is also, of course, an op stack chain. Brian Armstrong says this is huge. Reducing transaction fees and confirmation times on layer twos will open up so many more use cases for crypto. We are finally getting scalability. He's of course retweeting Jesse Pollock's tweet, saying after two years of hard work, blobs are now live on base before $0.31, after $0.00, but he actually means 0.00, $0.05. The network fee quoted inside of the Coinbase app to get from Ethereum to just to transfer ether from base to baseball to baseball wallet is $0.00. So, like, when Coinbase shows you like, here's a network fee, it's $0.00. Like, imagine the delight of retail users at this point in time."

Is absolutely insane for a $4 transfer Zora, it doesn't stop there. Of course. The gas cost to mint on Zora was $0.61. Now it is. .009 e. Granted. Granted, we are in day one of blobs.

This is a doom board that we're going to look at from zero x. Rob, if you scroll down, you can see a blobs per blob. And so blobs actually have a very similar mechanism to EIP 1559, where we are targeting three blobs per block. And if we have more than three blobs per block, then blobs get more expensive. If you have less than three blobs per block, then blobs get less expensive. We are under three blobs per block, and we have been since the inception of blob space. You want to scroll down a little bit? It's the blobs per block. There we go. So you can see that purple line. We are below the line, the target line of three blobs per block. And so this is why blobs are so cheap. More layer twos, leveraged blob space. We will get this thing called blob contention, which is the fee market for blobspace. And so then blobs will start to increase the price of blobs because it is congested. And then what do we do after that, Ryan? We make more blob space."

But also they have this thing called Arbos Atlas upgrade, which is just a normal arbitrum software update for the arbitrum layer two. That also, in addition to leveraging blobs space independently of the lowering gas fees of blob space, will also lower gas fees by another 90% just because it's optimizations on the Arborstrom side."

And so there was so many moving parts to make this happen. So I thought this whole entire thread was fantastic, so I'll read through it. EIP 4844 is more than a tech upgrade. It is a substantial shift in how Ethereum core devs work at all, improving the relationship between research and client teams and welcoming layer two core devs. It might be the most important moment in the transition to the roll up centric roadmap."

        "text": "When we started two years ago before the merge, there were tensions between the research and client teams. It wasn't always clear that the ideas on the research side were feasible to implement and took into consideration all the client complexity. This is one of the reasons why proto lambda and others conceived of proto dank sharding, which is pro 4844, which is what we just merged. It was a sort of prototype or an early iteration towards full denk shard that was technically feasible and ready to ship ASAP. ASAP turned into two years, but this was even only possible because 4844 was a compromise. It made a massive dent in scalability. Future proofed full day charting and took into account client complexity. It forced research client and layer two teams to work closely together. One optimism made shipping 4844 a top priority and allocated multiple core devs to the effort. Two base teams started working and contributing to 4844 before the idea of base was even conceived. Prismatic labs three, now part of our chain labs, that's arbitrum, evolved into layer two development. With 4844 as a gateway and many, many more examples of the above. 4844 acted as a central project that unified the efforts of so many research client teams and layer two devs. It feels like we're in a whole new era. Compared to two years ago, Ethereum is feeling substantially more productive and pragmatic, and with layer two teams now a major part of the mix, the roll up centric roadmap is in full swing. When I read this, I just got goosebumps because especially with every single major hard fork that we do in Ethereum. I'm just reminded about how we are doing this crazy new thing called decentralized consensus and decentralized governance and decentralized coordination in order to discover the best paths forward. That in my opinion, the Ethereum core devs and researchers all collectively agree and come to consensus on what those is, what those are, and then they successfully merge them into the Ethereum protocol. And I just get goosebumps that we as humans can even and like manage to produce something like that. And so I'll just like take a moment and say thank you to anyone involved with Dankoon, EIP 4844, all the other eips and actually like getting this thing into the Ethereum protocol. So many stakeholders needed to be just juggled and it was done in just, you know, super elegant fashion. So big thank you to everyone getting involved here."

One is that beacon block routes are now accessible in the EVM. Why is that important?"

Beacon block routes are now accessible to the EVM. The beacon block route is a consensus layer layer thing. The EVM is an execution layer thing. We have the beacon chain and the state of the beacon chain, which is a block route, is now being made accessible to the Ethereum virtual machine, aka the Ethereum application layer aka Defi lightclients brings out two exciting use cases, proof of validator behavior and then efficient o of log proofs for historical block data. Basically the proof of stack stake, the Internet bond that is Ethereum. The staking and also restaking state of things is being made accessible to Ethereum's own DeFi application layer, the actual protocol. And this is really good for Eigen layer for AVss that need to know the state of beacon blocks. So who's got the ETh where and the AVss of Eigen layer can now know that same thing with like LST's and lrTs. And so this is just a stronger coupling between the proof of stake layer of Ethereum and the defi layer of also of Ethereum. I thought that was worth pulling out."

        "text": "So I think a big question is we painted this picture of gas fees have gone down for now on layer twos, but demand is going to increase and so they will increase in cost as things go. So where do we go from here? And there's two kinds of categories I want to talk about for further reduction of layer two fees and expansion of the bandaid bandwidth of layer twos. One is on the Ethereum upgrade path, I'm going to let you talk about that. But the other is in parallel to all of this. What's actually happening is the layer twos themselves are improving in their ability to support bandwidth execution bandwidth, let's call it a few things that are happening. One, of course, we've talked about so much, which is parallelization of the evMs, of evms, and also other virtual machines like the SVM, putting that in a layer two so we can have a very high throughput layer two, that also increases our bandwidth in our TPS. We also have room to maneuver on ZK proving and verification cost decreases. So there's a lot of projects that are specifically working on that that will really help our ZK vms and our ZK rollups. And then there's also just generally, you mentioned arbitrum deploying some more call transaction compression some optimization in terms of how they're posting data to, to Ethereum. And so that is ongoing work and will continue to get better. I mean, I think Vitalik said there could be like gains of three to five x just from compression alone, and then everything else is still a bit too expensive. You still need like fractions of a penny. There's third party DA solutions, you know, one of which is Celestia, which we've talked about for then Eigen layer DA is coming aboard as well, which will be an absolute massive expansion in terms of data availability bandwidth, if Ethereum main chain is getting too expensive. So all of these solutions combined are going to continue to drop gas fees towards zero. Every time it spikes back up, there'll be an improvement and we'll get back down to zero. There's also main net improvements coming as well. David. So like, what are the next Ethereum upgrades and hard forks? What are they going to do for bandwidth?"

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I'll invoke the words of Mike nor here we get three x in terms of data availability. So blob space, the thing we just shipped, will get three x larger for the next three to four years in a row. So we'll get a three x by just increasing the blob count and gas modifications. We can kind of do that today. We'll get that throughout this year. In 2025 we'll get this thing called peer Das, pure data availability sampling. And then in 2026, these are all like super hypothetical timelines. When dank sharding comes around, we'll get another three x. And these are three x's on top of each other. These aren't like linear three x's, these are exponential three x's. And so like gas fees are just dying on layer two, they're going to zero. It doesn't matter how much induced demand we can get, we can also get more block space to like the logical conclusion. If we can't get there with Mir just adding more data availability, we'll get there with Zenith. The conclusion of layer two, gas fees is that they go away. They go away for the end user, they are perceived to be zero. They aren't actually zero, but they are so close to zero that the meta will just converge on somebody and some third party is going to pay for their users transaction fees because that's a user acquisition strategy. Gas fees on the layer two are just like in the fullness of time, which is only three, four years going away. It's going to be a field about."

But 1st first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Swell, the LST project that turned into an LRT project when Eigen Layer came out, is now building their layer two with native restaking yields built in. So we're integrating all of the innovations that 2023 and 2024 have brought us with swell. Swell's own ZkevM from the polygon chain development kit, built in collaboration with Eigen da so da for data availability and alt layer as their roll up as a service provider along with Chainlink. And so they're getting all of the big players into the swell layer two as well. And I think if I'm understanding this correctly, they are taking the blast playbook and putting in native yield into the swell layer too. Except this time not just with staking yield, but with restaking yield as well.

Geato needed to make a mempool because Jitto is this mev organization orchestration optimization, part of Solana module, of Solana, if you will. And so they need to have a mempool because they need people to reorder their transactions. And so there needs to be this waiting room for, call it like, block builders and I, Solana, to reorder the transactions, take out the MEV, because that's the business model, and then give it to the Jito sole holders. In the same way that this is basically how Ethereum works. Jitto turned off their mempool, which basically means that they turned off their product, basically turning off all the mev extraction that would go to Jito soul holders.

And so other investors include a DBA, that's John Charbonneau, polychain Robot Ventures, but being a led by placeholder and HackVC, that's Chris Berniske and also the people over at HACC, along with some angels. Barnaby from the Ethereum Foundation. Austin Federer from the Solana Foundation. Hazu. Eric Waldisi, investor, Santiago Santos. Pretty cool. It just explains itself. Take the Solana virtual machine that everyone knows and loves. Place it as a layer two on Ethereum. Make it go even, be even cheap. See what happens."

This is a compute coordination network. I think one big reason why you and I were bullish is they've created this like, identity article Oracle. And, you know, on chain identity has been a thorny problem for crypto to solve. It's been an unsolved problem. But if you're trying to drop an airdrop, if you're trying to incent a community and you want to know who the humans are, who the civil resistant, unique humans are, versus who the bots are and who the farmers are, you need a solution to do that. And Qlik has this kind of anti Sybil identity, Oracle, where you can plug in your web two profiles and qualify potentially for airdrops. That's just one of like a hundred different solutions this team is brewing up. So pretty excited to back those guys as well."
