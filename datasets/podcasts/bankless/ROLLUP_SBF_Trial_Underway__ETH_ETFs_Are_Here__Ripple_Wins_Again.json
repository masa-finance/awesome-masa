Marketing pushes by, of course, the big boys, Blackrock, fidelity, Franklin, Templeton. There's bond markets are forcing central bank intervention. We did kind of a show, a macro show this week that was talking a little bit about that. Just the inevitability, of course, the money printer being turned back on. We don't know when, but it will be inevitable. That's kind of the theory. Awareness of us debt starting to become more than what we can service. So we have more in interest payments than we make as money as a country. It's just healthy financials. And then, of course, the happening in early 2024, bitcoins gets its happening, I think, in March, late March. And so the issuance of bitcoin will be cut in half.

Diamond hands are the ones holding the bitcoin at this point. So, you know, that's the bull case, I guess, for October. Now, whether that happens in October or it takes a little bit longer, I mean, who's to say? But it's a fun meme. Arthur Hayes, however, is taking the other side here. He's calling this rectober, and he's not so much talking about crypto as he is. He's talking about the banking sector. Okay. They say, he says the banking crisis is contained. Nah, it's about to be rectober. Thanks, Jay Powell and Grandma Yellen for the bear steepener that will bankrupt the banks. Grandma yelling Grandma Yellen, he calls her small bank index only 8% higher than April lows. Yahtzee. So he's saying, do you know when we were talking about the bank crisis last March, April? He's saying, well, we've been on a pause, but it's about to come back around. I didn't know this. Small bank index only 8% higher than April lows. Right.

And so this is a chart I found this week making the case that China's kind of done with treasuries.

I mean, historically there's been a ton of demand, mostly in the form of central bank balance sheets. China has been buying a lot. Japan has been buying a lot. What happens if they reverse course? I guess there's also been some debate about this. Some other people are saying, well, China's really not selling that much as far as treasuries. They're still continuing to buy. Apparently the dataset here is pretty opaque. It's not very transparent. It was hard to tell exactly what China is doing. So there's some back and forth. But I don't know. My TLDR is, if you're China, are you bullish on us bonds? Are you bearish considering what's going on? Considering 1 trillion in debt is being added every single month at this point in time and the US is at as relative to GDP kind of world war two level of debt ratios, what would you do if you were a central banker?"

It's not like China is saying, hey, we have decided that we are going to be short United States bonds and long equities or gold. We're talking apples and oranges here. Remember, as bad as United States fiscal situation is, it's more or less worse everywhere else. Argentine peso, for example, is inflating at over 100% a year.

So I can do those numbers. Well, have to, I guess, read the book to get Michael Lewis's full take, but, yeah, that's how it's going. But here's a plot twist, David, big plot. So, apparently, FTX invested in a company. Of course it was investing in all sorts of things. One of the things it invested in is equity in a company called Anthropic. What is anthropic, and why is that a plot twist? Why is that relevant here?"

In fact, so much that it might actually be enough to plug the hole that FTX owes creditors if they can find liquidity on their deal. So if they can sell their anthropic ownership on the secondary market to interested buyers, they, in theory, have enough money to pay back creditors because they made a venture bet that somehow paid off."

Now, there are a bunch of ETH Futures ETF from a various number of issuers, Vanek, Proshares, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, volatility shares. And so they're off. This is the SEC doing the thing of not king making any one particular ETF, and so they're allowing nine of them to all launch at once. And so this has created a competition between all the ETF issuers, who, in their first moments of inception, really need to clamor for market share and mind share, which has created some really awesome marketing efforts by some of these organizations. I'd like to highlight one van eck with two big moves. First, their big move number one, some absolutely hilarious marketing. We don't have enough time to watch all of their video ads about their ETH futures ETF, but they are really good. Very zoomer. Yeah. Let's watch this one. Just close your eyes to enter the ether. The ether is within you. Prepare to harness the potential of ethereum. Now, finally, in an ETF forum coming."

Yeah, that's big move number one, some of their most hilarious marketing. And again, I can't emphasize enough, some great Zoomer meme videos that are worth watching. Big move number two, out of Vanek donating 10% of their ETH futures etfemen profits to the protocol guild. What's the protocol guild? The protocol guild is this organization. It's kind of like this dao that is an effort to unbundle the EF. And so a lot of Ethereum core developers are a part of protocol guild who are building and maintaining the Ethereum code base, just like the ETH core devs and related people. And so 10% of the Vaneck ETH futures ETF profits gets donated to the protocol guild. This tweet thread announcing this and talking about, like, their decision behind this got 3500 likes, which is a lot. We got Tim Baker retweeting it saying, very cool to see a tradfi company directly fund Ethereum core development out of its profits. Hope that they can set an example for many of the businesses in this space that are building on top of open source protocols. Everyone liked that. So here's a bunch of tweets that I just, like, put into a photoshop. We got David Eth, David EtH from Polygon saying, vanek understood the assignment, talking about giving back to open source protocols. We got lite clients, Matt saying, wow, thank you. We got Liam saying, public goods are good. We got crypto Texan saying, this is pretty badass. We got no sleep.

So there's like Van Eck, bitcoin trust, bitwise, bitcoin ETP Trust, iShares, Bitcoin Trust, Franklin, bitcoin ETF, Grayscale's Ethereum Futures Trust. There's so many pending financial products, both spot and futures, for bitcoin and ether, that are waiting to get approved or denied soon tm. So the line to get access to get approval is large. And the claim here is that the SEC is running out of ways to say no. One of the big news is here is that Grayscale filed to convert their eth e trust, their ether trust, into an ETH ETF.

Many of those are active users of Ethereum roll ups, 20 million TIA, two stakers and IBC relayers of the cosmos hub and osmosis. And so this is one of the more interesting airdrops in that it is a multi chain airdrop. Because Celestia is a modular data availability chain. It's meant to be in the multichain ecosystem.

Interoperability layer twos. Layer two abstractions. We are like three to four out of ten on that off an on ramp capability stuff."

But the thing is, it's just like we get better because of bull markets. And so like, the bull market will identify the weaknesses, they will exploit the weaknesses, we will feel pain and then we will solve those weaknesses. So are we ready for bull market? No. Will we get one anyways? Yes. Will it provide valuable motivation and identification of things we need to work on to be ready for the next bull market? Yes, it will."

One of the things I think I'm most worried about for the next bull market in terms of hacks is actually bridge risk, though, David. That's why it's really great to see, you know, op stack get fraud proofs kind of together and iron that out. But I still worry a lot about the brittleness of our bridges, particularly in this multi chain environment."

There are others, but we're more ready than last time, is what I would say. In particular, our block space is going to be a lot cheaper. So that at least is good. We got some takes of the week.

The SPF overhang of crypto is gone multiple times. Kevin Owocky. After visiting Capitol Hill, Matt Hogan discussing tradfi clients and interests. And the SBF trial begins this week. Too soon. We will be totally rid of SBF's curse. David, you think SBF has cursed this industry, and we're getting ready to cast away that curse?"

We're getting rid of that. Awaki said when he was in Capital Hill that the stank of SBF seems to have mostly lifted. The opportunists who used SBF and the FTX implosion to advance their agenda last year have played their hands already, implying that anyone who wants to use the FTX as to gouge the knife into crypto, they've already done that, and they don't have any more juice to squeeze there. Matt Hogan says that as soon as Blackrock filed their bitcoin, ETF clients stopped being concerned. Or, like, raising the topic of FTX and SBF. And this is before we put SBF in jail for decades. Right. So once that happens, then, like, what do you mean? SBF is crypto. We put him in jail. Like, he's not crypto. That's gone."

Wall street friendly gives economic freedoms to banks and institutions. Securities clarity, stablecoins, and ETF's are all Wall street freedoms. Citizen friendly gives freedom to individual citizens. Right to encryption, right to custody your own assets, right to peer to peer commerce. These are citizen freedoms. I expect most jurisdictions to grant Wall street crypto freedoms eventually, but citizen freedoms, citizen freedoms will be a fight. I love this dichotomy. I love this dichotomy."

But yeah, it very much struck me that even, even some of these ETF wins and some of these security wins in court, these are still kind of the surface level Wall street freedoms, and they're. They're worth fighting for and they're good for crypto. And I couldn't be more pleased. And I think we eventually win there. But what I'm more worried about is the actual citizen freedom. So I'm worried about us being able to go through kind of the full defi gauntlet and preserve that as an open, permissionless, censorship resistant protocol that anybody in the world with an Internet connection can use without having to use a state id, Aml KYC, without it being controlled by some sort of centralized gatekeeper or intermediary. Those are some of the freedoms, like the right to encryption, the right to privacy, the ability for me to pay you, David, without some eye of Sauron kind of watching that transaction with the ability to kind of gatekeep it, that's what I worry about. And those are the things that I think bankless cares most about. And if we just get the banker freedoms, but we don't get these citizen freedoms, I'm not feeling great about what we've accomplished. I mean, it's maybe incrementally better, but it's more of the same."

There is a gap between all the good news that's happening, Gary taking the L's, getting the ETF's, but the prices are absolute dog shit. What's up with that? That is called opportunity, my friend. That is, the difference between those two things is what you should be bullish about. If you have conviction and you're seeing good news happen and you are seeing prices get cheaper, that should be awesome for you.

I mean, just this new, weird Internet money crypto asset that was programmable. And to see it seven years later, now it's an ETF form. ETF form. It's not just about the liquidity to me, it's about the legitimacy. This has been adopted by financial markets. It has no banking, has no centralized company. It has no ten ks, no SEC statements, doesn't register anywhere. And it's worth $200 billion. And you can get it in your schwab account. That took seven years, but that's relatively short compared to where we've come from. I mean, it's a weird Internet money. It's like a digital asset. And we've gotten this far in such a short period of time. And so when I look back on that, I'm pretty blown away at our progress, actually. And so that's what I'm bullish on, this increasing legitimacy of this asset class. And now we've leaked into Wall street. We've got them. Got them in.
