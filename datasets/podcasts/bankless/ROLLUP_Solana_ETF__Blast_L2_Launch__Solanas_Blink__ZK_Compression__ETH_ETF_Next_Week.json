That's $9.4 billion in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Mostly bitcoin. There are some, like, nuances, some, like, details about how it's getting released. It's not getting all released all in one lump sum like some fundsters would like to have you believe, but I, uh. It is going to the majority, a bulk of it, a big chunk is of it. Is getting distributed in early July, which is coming up next week and week after. Uh, people fear that that will be sell pressure because these people have been locked up since 2014. Like, surprise, surprise, bitcoins got up very bigly since 2014. Uh, and so, uh, people think that, like, they're going to want to cash out on their gains. I think the answer is a lot more nuance. You can listen to our episode about that. Uh, claims on Mount Gox have been a thing that you could have sold. Uh, and so it's not like sellers have been meaningfully locked up for a very long time. They could have sold their claims to Mount Gox if they really wanted liquidity. Uh, and so claims have been, like, turned around. A lot of hedge funds have bought claims, like VC funds have bought claims because it's basically buying discounted bitcoin. If you're a long term holder, you might as well do it. Uh, I kind of think the sell pressure from this is overblown. It's kind of going to be cool to get, like, this bitcoin kind of reintroduced into the supply. Um, it's not necessarily bullish, actually. It's just not bullish. It is bearish in the sense that, like, there can only be sell pressure from this.

Since the beginning of the opening of the bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has acquired two mount Gox worth of bitcoins, about 300,000 bitcoin. So that's what we're talking about here. There is some sell pressure, right? Even if you take the full amount, I know you're talking about creditors and that sort of thing, but, like, even if you took the full amount, I mean, the bitcoin ETF more than pays for it, right?

Constrained supply, that's the ultrasound money meme, improved regulatory clarity. I think that was bullish for the entire market, but especially for ether after the SEC drops its consensus lawsuit. But I would also say that's, like, equally bullish. Any other token that was at risk of becoming a security like Solana, like anything else, that's like a centrally issued smart contract platform. So that's like bullish for the entire market. And then significant improved ux. Thank you. Base institutional adoption, Blackrock, and then also cycle timing, macro conditions, and the election.

I would imagine maybe up to six months for zero fees. Um, and then a take from Nate Jurassi, who says, for the record, I expect a grayscale to meaningfully undercut everyone on fees with the ETH mini trust, which is what they're doing with it.

This kind of, like, come, came as a shock because we have been told many, many times that the process for getting an ETF, a crypto ETF, is first you get a futures ETF ETF in order to get price discovery, like price discovery happening on the futures ETF and then have spot to futures correlation be proved. Once it's approved, then you can legitimately go to the SEC and get your ETF. That has been the hurdle that the Gensler administration has said exists, and that's why the industry has been like, well, there's no new ETF's coming for a long time, because you first need years of just price on a futures ETF first. Nonetheless, they have filed this s one, which gives it is an application for a Solana ETF, which is the first part of the process. Uh, James Safer here says early thoughts are that this only has a shot to launch sometime in 2025. If we have a new administration in the White House and the SEC even then, it's not guaranteed. Uh, and so I think James is saying maybe in 2025, if Trump gets elected and also replaces the SEC with pro crypto people, then we can be kind of optimistic about this ETF. He also continues and says there's no deadline yet for this ETF because this filing is just an s one at the moment. I don't see a 19 b four filing yet, which would give us an idea of timing deadline timing, if they were to file a 19 b, four today. The deadline would be sometime around mid March 2025. Eric Balatrona says the knee jerk reaction here to this is, oh, this will never be approved because there aren't Solana futures. I agree. But if change at the present United States, I think anything is possible. Just imagine Hester purse or someone like that running the SEC. So Heather purse won't be running the Sec. She just wants to move on. This is known. So it would have to be someone else running the SEC. But nonetheless, it's a shot on goal. It's an attempt to get a solana ETF.

This is if your frame of mind starts with a far caster frame. That's the place to start. It is an embedded, that's an embedded link that you can, you know, paste over the Internet that will allow action aware clients, which is like your browser extension, like a phantom, for example, or anything, who is, like, integrated with this to display additional capabilities for your user. So on a website, a blink might immediately trigger a transaction preview in a wallet so that you, like, don't have to go to your app that would be on Solana, so you don't have to open up Jupiter. But a Jupyter blink inside of a tweet would make a little frame that shows Jupiter and maybe some token that you might want to buy or something, or some Solana NFT. And so the idea is that this pushes the ability to interact with Solana to websites just via a URL. And so I just want to emphasize, you need to have an extension that opens up this portal to Solana. And so Phantom is one of these things. They are integrating this. And so if you have the phantom on your browser, in your browser, and then you have a blink and a tweet, then this frame will show up inside of Twitter, which will let you do something. It's pretty cool."

If you're writing a tweet and you format the tweet in a certain way that conforms to the blank standard, then it can be expanded into just a mini embedded app inside Twitter for those that have the wallet extension that is required, and also the functionality turned on. So here's how it looks in, like, Phantom. You go into Phantom and you enable Solana actions on x.com dot. So it's not all websites, but right now it's on x.com dot.

I do think that ethereum layer twos will be moving on this too. And they should be moving now. Now it's ethereum layer two's, you know, a chance to go copy something from Solana.

        "text": "ZK compression, this is a collaboration between two different Solana ecosystem companies, light protocol and Helios Labs. Helios is a RPC provider. Uh, ZK compression allows Solana state to scale you. We all know what ZK compression does. Like start with a ZK roll up as your mental model. Uh, but the idea is you compress a lot of Solana activity, a lot of bundles, and you only post the proof in Solana active state. Uh, and so this is kind of similar to how ZK rollups on Ethereum would post proofs to call data before Ethereum had blobs. Uh, Solana has active state and it also has inactive state. And Solana charges rent on the amount of data posted to activestate. I believe if you do a lot of transactions, you bundle them up and then post the data, which is the big expensive part, into inactive state. And then you just post the proof to active state. You can get a cost efficiency that's improved by up to 162, 5000 times, which is a lot. And so it's somewhere. It's not exactly, it's not a layer two because there's not an off chain. There's not an off layer one blockchain that holds state on its own. All of the data is held in the Solana layer one. It's not exactly not a layer two, because it is like off chain compute using ZK compression. It's somewhere between a mix of a layer two and a stateless client."

The blast token is out and about in the wild. 17% was dropped to two different categories of people split 50 50 down the middle points holders and gold holders. Gold was one of the, like, growth campaigns out of blast, coming in at a whopping $2 billion in fully diluted valuation, which is a one to one ratio of its $2 billion of TVL, which is actually, like, kind of meaningfully lower than what other layer twos are being valued at that $2.3 billion valuations. Excuse me. 50% of the total distribution will go to, quote, unquote, the community. That is like incentives that will get spun out over time. That's also probably some sort of like Dow community run Dow, 25.5% to the core team, 16.5% to investors, and 8% to a foundation. Also, Blur, which was Pac Man's first project, was also allocated 3% of blast, who they say will go to blur traders and blur holders in season three. And even more in season four as well. A take out of Olympio here says Airdrop quota 17% is far above the standards, and that looks very good. But these vesting mechanics, although good for the chain to keep usage in TVL, are detrimental to top users who are the most responsible for the TVL use to boast metrics and receive funding. Aka, this is an important part of this for the top 1000 wallets that received the airdrops. The top 1000 airdrop recipients who got the most, uh, they are locked up."

Oh, this is a tweet out of the Georgios constantinopoulos, the CTO, now partner at Paradigm. He tweets out after almost two years of development and a successful audit by Sigma prime, we are finally releasing Reth 1.0, the first production ready release of our blazing fast Ethereum execution client. We invite RPC providers and stakers to run Reth. Reth is Rust Ethereum. There's Geth, which was go Ethereum, which was the first execution client for Ethereum. Now there's Rest. Georgios has been on this mission. There's the, the rust stations for all the people working on Ethereum. Rest for. That's kind of like their meme. That's why the rest is the symbol of a crab for the rest nations out there. Rust is just a really highly optimized coding language to what I understand. People love Ruth. Rest developers are in very hot demand now. Ethereum has a rest client. This is probably going to impact the Ethereum layer one. Not that much. Although it's always cool to add clients to our client diversity. I expect Reth to become the dominant client for layer twos because it's an execution client. And so this is really going to allow base to turn up the juice for every single layer too. To really turn up the juice. You put the execution client on the execution layers and now we got the execution client to do that. This has been Georgios pet project for like he said, two years now. We finally get 1.0 out the door. And really this is actually where the game, because now people are going to start to use this client and now the peloton can start to grow like Georgios and a few other people have been.

So it's going to prohibit any stable coin that does not adhere to a one to one reserve ratio. Okay. Prohibit it from the exchanges. Anyone in the real world, I guess they can't touch defi. I don't know what that means, but also banning algo stablecoins. So sorry, do Kwan, I don't know what this means for MKR. Is that a algo stablecoin? I'm actually not sure about that. Also, you have to obtain a license for your stablecoin from the electronic money institute, whatever that is. Also you need regular audits. Some of this is good, right? I think some of this is good, but like some of it could be a bit heavy handed, in particular the reserve requirements. So one of the challenges here is that some stable coins might not fit.

Because the majority of all stable coins are USD pegged, it is unlikely that many of them will be able to comply with Mika in the short term. So european citizens might face limited access to trading poor liquidity, and no access to more exotic crypto native investment opportunities. I mean, in the end, there's a question of like, well, maybe Europeans just don't have access to stablecoins on exchanges. And is that what Europe is trying to do here? Here's a take from Seth Hertlein, who's actually like bearish on a lot of this Mika legislation. He's been involved in the trenches. He works over at ledgers. He says this, many Americans who don't understand Europe still point to Mika and suggest that the US is falling behind. But I'm a big proponent of beer systems theory, that the purpose of a system is what it does and what it's doing is making the EU uncompetitive in yet another emerging tech sector.

FDIC is in the part of the Treasury Department alleging that these federal regulators are attempting to undermine the cryptocurrency industry. The lawsuit claims that these agencies have pressured banks to deny crypto firms access to the federal banking system, which Coinbase argues is a deliberate effort to cripple the digital asset industry.

So if you have, if you're a bankless in and you have your 2022 or 23 or 24 PO app, go to that wallet and that wallet will have one vote in it, and you will be able to go vote for one of the 34 podcast episodes. And then we will do whichever podcast episodes come first. Well, I mean, like, somebody wants Ray Dalio. Did they put Ray Dalio as a vote? We will also. I also want Ray Dalio. Honestly, I hope to get you that no matter what. That'd be really cool. So we're going to do our best. And then if we, if the number one is like Ray Dalio, but we just can't get him, we'll just go down to number two. But some, one of these podcast episodes is getting done in order of votes."

We're coming on down to like 30 or 40 spots left. And so, yeah, it's going to be cool to hang out with all of you. It's good to see everyone in person."
