I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. CZ, the co founder of Binance, is gone. He's serving a prison sentence right now. So who is running Binance these days? Who took over for him? Binance is, by some measures, the largest exchange in the world. It's had a crazy couple of years. Was fined $4 billion by the us government. Its founder is now spending four months in jail. David, it's always four, isn't it? It's always four. Binance. Richard Tang is the guy who's filling CZ's shoes, and we felt it was time to finally meet him. So that is our guest on today's episode. We talk about a few things. Number one, who is Richard? Why is he here? Number two, how does he plan to take Binance to a billion users? Number three, are things with us regulators really settled? Like, is there a blank slate? Number four, the story of why Binance execs are being forcibly held in Nigeria right now. Like, what is going on with that? And number five, we end with some fun price predictions for the bull market."

And really, my question that I was trying to get asked, is this a new era for Binance? Is there a before and after of CZ, of Binance, after CZ's departure, or is, are things going to continue on as usual? I'll let the listener kind of listen to the episode with Richard and decide for that. But it is nice to get to know the guy who's now at the helm of, like, the largest crypto empire that's out there, uh, and what his plans are for the next era for. For Binance's growth as we enter this next crypto cycle."

And I want to talk to you about that in the debrief. So, uh, for bankless citizens, there's a debrief episode waiting for you in on your bankless premium feed. If you are not a bankless citizen, you don't have access to that, but you can get access. There's a link in the show notes, uh, where you can get the bankless premium feed, like, no ads, all of the debriefs, all the goodies that David and I pack in. All right, guys, let's get right to our episode with Richard. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible, including bankless nation. I want to introduce you to Richard Tang. He's the new CEO of Binance, which is the largest exchange in the world. He took over the role in November 2023 after the departure of Binance's founder, CZ, who stepped down following a legal settlement with us authorities. Now, as of the time of recording, CZ is serving a four month sentence in a federal prison in California. Some background on Richard that David and I dug up, but we're going to find out more from him today. He joined Binance in August 2021. He was the CEO of Binance Singapore, and before that, he was working in the financial regulatory world, Nabu Dhabi, and also in Singapore. And I think we should save the rest of the intro for Richard, because this conversation is really about getting to know him in his own words. Richard, welcome to bankless."

I started my career with the Central bank of Singapore. I stayed there for 13 years, doing things like licensing, authorization of capital markets of banks, insurance firms, etcetera. But I had a stint doing financial sector development, trying to develop Singapore's private sector, private banking sector, asset management, reinsurance sector. I was sent to New York for two years. I stayed in Batric Park City for two years to try to bring in the lights of black Rock, then into Singapore. That's way back in 2001, 2002, and it happened during 911. So I saw the collapse of the twin tower as well. Wow."

And I was there for seven years until I was headhunted to Abu Dhabi Global market to become the CEO of Financial Services Regulatory Authority. So my background is essentially mainly in regulations as well as more tread flying in nature. I have a chance meeting with CZ sometime in June of 2021, and we hit it off.

What drew you into binance and this weird alternative financial system that we call crypto?"

I started in 2017, and that's where I was in, actually, Boca Raton, attending a futures industry association, which I go every year. So the top honchos from exchange, global exchanges, New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq ICE, CME, etcetera, will go there. So I was representing Singapore Exchange, and I went there, but that was the first year. Then I saw a lot of crypto boys coming through, and I got quite intrigued with this new industry. What exactly does it represent? The more I understood it, I said, look, I think this is the future of finance. And when I was CEO of Abu Dhabi Global Market, we became the first, then almost the first in the world to start rolling out a comprehensive framework to start regulating crypto. I tell people, I'm not your traditional regulator. I'm not the type of people that regulate banks without having a bank account. So I got my hand dirty opening up crypto accounts, started trading to get to know the industry much better. So my first exposure into crypto started in 2017 then, right. So I met a lot of people. I met the Winkleforce twins from Gemini. I met Jesse power from Kraken at that point in time, in a bid to try to attract them to set up shop in Abu Dhabi, and Kraken set up shop in Abu Dhabi then. So when I met CZ, I already had background in crypto. And then we sort of. He was trying to suss me out. Somebody introduced me, because at that point in time, I just came back to Singapore from Abu Dhabi, having stepped down as CEO. And then somebody introduced me. He was trying to suss me out. And then we went for lunch. But if you remember Singapore, then in June 2021 has very strict Covid measures. So we met at a place where there's only two of us, there's nobody else because we can't go to the restaurant. That lunch lasted about two and a half hours. On hindsight, after I joined Binance, I realized how precious those two and a half hours are because our meetings are packed 15 minutes, half an hour. So throughout the lunch conversation, I saw him calling his secretary, can you postpone my meeting? So I think he treated it quite seriously, and I hit it off then. And then he asked me to join violence. And I started in August 2021."

Like, hopping to meeting, to meeting, and just, like, continuously on the move, continuously. Just a very action oriented individual. Richard, in what you just said, you said in 2017 you saw crypto as the future of finance. Tell us a bit more about that. So, like, why was it apparently that crypto was the future of finance? What exactly drew you into that line of thinking?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Because if you look at it as policymakers globally, as well as banking regulators, one of the biggest problem that we tried to solve at that point in time was financial inclusion. Then we have been at it for 50 years, and financial inclusion isn't getting much better. If you look at, I mean, you are in America, so you are blessed. You have high level of financial inclusion. I'm in Singapore again. We have very high financial inclusion. But if you look at developing countries and frontier economies, you can see financial inclusion of between ten and 20%, meaning 80% of people in the world of that particular economy does not have access to banking, does not have access to payments, remittance, etcetera, either that or is very expensive for them. So the more I got into blockchain and crypto, I said, hey, look, this allows people to do limitance at a fraction of the cost in an instantaneous basis compared to the traditional method. I like banks that operate. I don't know what's the timing in the us banking hours, but in Singapore, it's probably between 930 to 04:00. But crypto is 24/7 it never sleeps, it keeps working. Anybody can access crypto in any part of the world on a 24/7 basis. So there's almost no hurdle rate for anybody that wish to be involved, to be involved in this industry, to get access to this technology and then use this technology as a mode of transfer of value. So that was very intriguing. But my thesis back then, and I still hold that thesis now is that for this industry to go mainstream, for it to be embraced, for adoption rate to go up, you need two things. Firstly, you need clarity of regulations, because you can have 5% adoption, or you can even reach 10% adoption without rules and regulations. But for it to hit 40 50%, a lot of users would demand clarity of rules regulations in terms of protection of their assets. So that's the first dimension that we need to see. And second thing, you need institutional investors coming into this space that brings in liquidity, know how, structuring of new products, creation of new financial instruments around crypto. So, to me, those are two things that are essential. And the second part of it, the second dimension, institution investors probably wouldn't come in until they see clearer regulations. So, which is why in 2017, I went about making sure that at least Abu Dhabi itself create a framework that is very supportive of crypto, giving crypto players a chance to be properly licensed to serve users, to make sure that users assets are properly protected, to bring about that growth in terms of crypto adoption."

I think we'll return to that question a little bit later in the conversation to find out why you're here. But that's cool to hear how you got in the space and caught the bug. Everyone comes in from a different vantage point. And your point about your bankless, right? Yeah, exactly."

        "text": "We do, we do. We believe that the intermediaries, like the big banking systems, are very ripe to be disrupted and to kind of reform around this new infrastructure that is evolving and emerging. I mean, your point about regulators and institutions is interesting as well. It certainly depends on having the right regulation, doesn't it? And regulation that doesn't slow us down. But before we get into some of those broader conversations, I still want to go back to maybe your initial conversation back there in Singapore for those two and a half hours with CZ, and then what's happened since then. So you took the job at Binance, and I'm just, like, looking out, I'm zooming out over the last two years and what an absolutely insane two years we've had. And I want to get in your head and kind of hear what it felt like from your perspective. But just a recap for bankless listeners who you've probably lived through the whirlwind that was, you know, 2022 to 2024. But like all of the craziness that happened 2022 FTX collapsed. You guys remember that, right? This is a major exchange, a major binance competitor. There was this CZ tweet from November 4 where he's dumping the FTT tokens. All of that happened, all of that chaos. In 2023, we got charges from the US against Binance, including AML and sanctions violations. So you were there for that. 2024, a judge ruled that Binance had to pay a $4.3 billion fee. This is like one of the largest in history. And CZ, the, you know, co, the founder of Binance, was sentenced to four months in jail. So that happened. He retired. And now here we are today, Richard, you have taken the lead as CEO. Binance keeps chugging. We've got a new bull market. Bitcoin recently hit all time highs. It's set to do that again here shortly. The BNB token as well just hit all time highs, which I was just surprised to see that in the last week or so. What was all of this like? I know you can't. There's some things I'm sure you can't comment on. Some things maybe you can, but, like, where were you when all of this was going on? When you step back and you zoom out and you look at the last two years, do you ever just ask yourself, what the heck was that? What just happened?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, there's never a dull day in crypto, especially. But maybe just to take a step back, binance is still a very young organization. We are going to celebrate our seven year anniversary next month. Imagine a seven year old organization, and we have 199 million users today. Going to hit 200 million users very soon. If you look at the pace of growth, the first 100 million users took us about five years, and the next 100 million users is going to take us about two years, or just slightly shorter than two years that show the pace of development and crypto adoption. I just want to put that in context. In the very early years, probably in the first five years, as you know, there are no, the rules are not very clear. It's at a very nascent, very early stage of development. So we are trying to see what we can do in terms of making sure that we satisfy the different requirements. But there are no very clear rules for us to comply in many of these areas. Even today, about one third of global regulators are regulating crypto. Still two thirds are still not regulating this page. Of the one third they're regulating, it is not easy because some are regulating them as securities, some treat as commodities, some treat them as digital payment token, and then others have a dedicated definition of virtual assets for them. And these views are conflicting with each other. Securities are quite different from commodities and how you regulate them. And that poses a big challenge for global platforms like ourselves. Every time when we do globally, when we do local deployment, we have to really understand the local rules, trying to find out how best to comply, tweak internal processes, our systems operational framework to satisfy them. So you understand the operational robustness that we need to have, especially when you operate on a 24/7 platform on that front. So yes, we were there in the midst of it. I was there looking at it. But truth be told, we are very mission focused. So we know there are all these challenges coming through. But our first priority has always been focusing on user, focusing on user protection, making sure that we serve our user needs while we pivot the company, probably in the first few years of the company, because of lack of clarity of some of these provisions and rules, we make mistakes. And CZ paid the ultimate price for some of this mistake. He took accountability, as you mentioned. He retired, stepped down from that role. I'm very honored and humbled that he and the rest of the leadership team picked me to be the next CEO. So we will continue on those very strong fundamentals and principles. I mean, we have built a very strong company, as you mentioned, is building on those fundamentals, making sure that we continue to be user focused, focusing on the products and services users want, continue to innovate on that front, by the same time making sure that we are compliant with all the new rules and provisions coming through. So I make three commitments when I step in as CEO of Binance, I say, look, firstly, we will always be user focused. User will always be at the heart of what we do. Extremely critical because our users and our community are accountable for our success. Without them, really, this platform has no one to serve. So we are very mindful. I'm very glad to go around the world meeting our users, meeting our community, because they give me feedback, they give up feedback on products and services that we need to enhance, areas that we need to look into things that they want to see, etcetera. And this includes both retail as well as vip customers. The second part is given that the direction of travel is towards one of more compliance. So we are working very closely with policy makers, regulators. You mentioned a good point just now to say that the regulatory framework should be progressive, should be smart to really, on the one hand, manage risk, on the other hand, support innovation. Because if you have a regulatory framework that only manages the risk but doesn't support innovation is not going to be beneficial for the economy. It's not going to be beneficial for the industry and ecosystem. It's detrimental. Given the importance of this industry, we work very closely with global regulators on that front to highlight to them how do we manage risk by the same time, support innovation. We have done a very successful case study in Dubai. The Dubai government approached us in late 2021 to develop a framework to support crypto. We came up with the framework with them and look at the huge success story that Dubai has now in terms of attracting crypto firms, crypto developers, projects, exchanges, asset managers, these are things that we do globally with every local jurisdiction. We are very supportive of local law enforcement efforts. The third commitment I have is working with crypto partners because we are still in a very early stage of crypto development. Five, 6% crypto adoption globally. I think the recent introduction of ETF, bitcoin, as well as ether approval, not only in the US, but if you look at global jurisdiction, from the likes of Hong Kong to Australia to different parts of Europe, I think everybody is pushing out their ETF approval now. So you see a mainstreaming of this industry. So we are working with traditional financial institutions, we're working with crypto firms to really support crypto adoption and deployment, because the more we can build this industry together, the more robust and vibrant the ecosystem. Everybody benefits and we will benefit from them. So that's my three commitment when I step in as CEO, and we will continue on that front, some of those challenges. I'm very glad that ourselves and our team, we have very experienced global leaders, we are in it together to solve all these problems together. So we are on a journey to solve these problems, to continue to serve our users well, and continue to grow a very sustainable and vibrant platform."

He built a massive cryptocurrency exchange that blankets the globe. Like, I'm kind of considered by many in the industry to be just a hero for onboarding so many into the world of crypto and for building what he built. And you are feeling that role. How does that feel? I would be intimidated, but that's why I'm a podcaster, not a CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange. I'm wondering just what your sentiments or emotions are as you stepped into the role. The very big shoes that CZ has left."

He brought about Binance in 2017 and he grew it from zero to the company that we are today. So I don't think anybody can replace him. I think we have to be our own person. I mean, he has built such a strong foundation for us to continue that very mandate. And our mission is to support the freedom of money, is to support our users globally. And also, binance in the first six and a half years is quite different from the binance going forward, because there are few things that have changed in the landscape. Firstly, there's clearer regulations today compared to the past. Direction of travel is quite clear. Compliance is something that everybody is looking at, the global regulators, users are looking at. So it's quite different as a company. It's also different. So he started off with a core team of seven group to 30, and then a few hundred, and then a few thousand. So it's totally different companies. But today, binance is a company of thousands. So managing this company require a very talented team of core managers, which we have put in place now. So it's not one person driving it, to me, it's a team effort that's driving it now. Also, the corporate structure has changed. So CZ used to be the CEO and decision maker, but today we have put in place a board of directors of seven. So you understand that once you have board of directors, we as a management, and I as CEO, together with my team, we are accountable to the board for corporate decisions, and they are the corporate steward. They set the direction of the company and we execute, and then we will change the execution direction depending on the needs of the landscape and what is evolving in the marketplace. But crypto evolved very quickly, day to day. As you know, it's evolving and innovating so quickly. So we are on our toes on a daily basis, making sure that we are ahead of the game, making sure that we know what's happening in the market. We are developing the right thing, we're enhancing our products and services, enhancing the features to serve our users, complying with what the regulators want, working with partners globally, including the likes of Mastercard, that you might have seen. So we are doing multiple things at the same time, but it's not an individual effort, so it's a team effort. We have very talented senior leaders, we're very committed mid tier managers, and also very hardcore junior officers within the firm, all believing in this mission or having the same values, or being hardcore humble, trying to add value, protecting our users."

And so how familiar you are with CZ and the way that CZ thinks, I think will answer the question of, is binance going in the same direction that CZ would have led it? Or maybe that was never really the intention in the first place. Maybe CZ, with his board of directors and advisors, identified a North Star for Binance that was independent of CZ, and you were also going in that same direction. I'm wondering if you can just familiarize us with how familiar you were with CZ's direction, or whether or not CZ was actually working more collaboratively with the rest of the company to define a north star for the whole company."

I mean, he started after Singapore, he started to ask me to take care of Middle East North Africa region, which I'm familiar with. So I took over as the region ahead for that particular region. And that Pie started to grow to include Europe and then Asia Pacific, and then rest of the world. So I work very closely with him, as the rest of the leaders do work very closely with CZ. But a lot of his thinking are set in to the mission, values and DNA of the company. So many in the company knows, and he defined a lot of these things, and all these are positive attributes. So at any point in time when we make a decision, CZ was very clear. So does this benefit the user? Does this protect the users? Those are his guiding principles in making decisions, and those became the guiding principle for us, for all of us in binance. Does this protect the user? Is it beneficial for the user? Is it beneficial to market? If it is, we will do so. If it does, then no. Many of these decisions are, in our view, not difficult to make, because we always try to make sure that users are protected. Things are beneficial to users. For example, something very simple that started way back in 2017, 2018. You know, coins get lost when users transfer wrongly to wrong addresses, and it happens all the time. And it may not be intended for our wallets or their wallets with binance, but we took effort to try to trace back those and then pass back to users, and that was unheard of way back then. So that is a demonstration of how far we go to safeguard users interests. We are the first to come up with a Safoo fund to protect users in case there's anything untoward in terms of cyber attacks or cybersecurity. You can see the psyche of the organization is one that best place user interest first to make sure that we treat the users, and then they will treat us right, which is why we have such a strong community globally. People believe in us. This trust is not built over six months or one year. It's built consistently through our action over the course of seven years till now. And we will continue to make sure that we maintain that confidence and trust of our users."

And you see that in terms of things like corporate structure, it has moved from when CZ step down to what we have today in terms of having a board of directors, having the different subcommittees within directors in a form and format that regulators are much more familiar with. So we continue to gravitate towards that, because that's the direction in which this industry is growing. And we need to move with the times. We need to move to the times in terms of what our users want. So what the users want today will be quite different from last year. So we have wrought things like tripartite arrangement with some of our corporate clients and with financial institutions, retail investors. Webtree Wallet was a new innovation from us. This is something that they wanted, enhancing our copy trading feature, allowing them to do mock trading as well. So these are things that we will continue to make sure that we innovate on that front. So again, is continue to pivot towards being a fully regulated global financial institutions, making sure that we build a very robust enterprise that's sustainable, that's going to go from strength to strength for the next 50 years, not only built for the last seven years.

Incredibly impressive to hear that in seven short years, Binance now has 200 million users. And all of those users are onboarded into crypto and taking their first step to go bankless and exchange is generally the place that you start. Let's talk about big picture. How do you turn that 200 million into 1 billion? What's going to do it for binance? What's going to do it for crypto? Talk about the use cases, the apps. I don't know where you want to take this, but 200 is pretty impressive. But we're not satisfied with that. This is the future of finance. We want everyone to have access to these tools. How does binance get to a billion?"

        "text": "So just take the big picture first. If you look at the big picture, crypto adoption is still very early stage. So today we have about five to 6% in terms of global crypto adoption. But the introduction of ETF, the mainstreaming of crypto, I think that would be a big boost into crypto. So if you look at the data, about 15 billion has flown in into crypto via the ETF that's launched in the US since the beginning of this year. So I think that's a massive figure. If you look at the market capitalization of crypto today is about 2.6 trillion bitcoins, accounts for close to slightly more than half of that, 1.3 trillion or more. We are still at a very early stage, including this particular cycle, I think we are still at a very early stage. Jenny Johnson from Franklin Delcotta says it very well, even for institutions. She thinks that the big institutional money are getting ready to come in. They are not in yet. They need to do their own due diligence. But 18 days of net inflow into the bitcoin ETF, I think that is just extremely robust demand. And if you look at the performance of Blackrock ETF, I think that's the best ETF launch ever. So I think all this just goes to show how much underlying demand there is, and there will be, as we bring about even greater education to more investors, both institution as well as retail, into this space. So I think that's the first factor. With all these new inflows of liquidity, new investors, naturally everybody should benefit from it, and we aim to be part of that, being one of the largest players in this space. So I think that's one. Secondly, continue to do what we do best, which is to serve our customers extremely well, so that they want to continue using our platform. We want to continue to bring in new users globally on that front, making sure that we have the best products and services that are attractive to them. So I think there's no secret sauce to that is hard work, understanding, listening to users continue to innovate on our ops and tech. Something that we pay a lot of attention to is our operational resilience. Unlike traditional financial institutions, that operates a certain hours a day, at least, the public facing part operates a certain hour. We have to operate 24/7 across the globe. So in terms of technology and operational demand, robustness is extremely important. So those are things that we pay a lot of attention to, because you can't imagine that how much users will be impacted on that front if we are not robust enough in that aspect. These are areas that we continue to invest greatly. The usage of AI, which is impacting every industry, again, are things that we are deploying into various aspects of of it, including into our compliance program. We should continue to invest very heavily. Last year, we have invested about 238 million into our compliance program. So again, we will continue to make sure that we pivot very strongly, continue to serve both existing customers well, as well as bring new users into this, and then making sure that together with new product development, innovation, we support some of these new projects as well as new products coming on stream."

I feel like I have a very good sense of Coinbase and Kraken's user concentration, but I think binance is much more spread out deeper in emerging markets, has the potential to grow the population and its user base even faster, given its international focus. So where are these users generally concentrated? And where do you think the geographic areas of the world are primed for growth for crypto, actually, we see growth."

        "text": "In every region, but sometimes they take different turns and we serve global users, from Asia Pacific to Europe, to Middle East Africa region to Latin America, etcetera, almost everywhere serving global users. But what I will say is this. The countries and the region with the fastest crypto adoption are where normally the demographics are much younger compared to neighboring countries or other regions, and secondly, where financial inclusion are slightly lower compared to other places. And you can understand why, where the population is much younger, they tend to understand crypto much better, or they can learn crypto much faster. So you imagine a person in his fifties or sixties or even late forties most of their life, they have dealt with traditional financial products and instruments. Trying to get them to invest into crypto will take some time, which is why ETF is a great product. ETF may not be a great product for you and me because of the fees involved, because we are in crypto, but for them, it makes perfect sense to get exposure via ETF. So everywhere we see younger demographics, we see much better marketplace for ourselves, a much faster crypto adoption deployment. You have a much more enthusiastic community in those places. The second area is where financial inclusion is lower. Again, it's understandably why, because people have no access to proper payment system. People have no access to proper financial banking system. Banks charge them very high fees to even open a bank account, and many banks are refusing to open bank account for them. So crypto becomes the mode in which they can do payment, they can make savings, they can do remittance on that front, and it's excellent for them and is necessarily very cheap compared to what financial institutions charge them. So in these regions or in these countries, we normally see much faster crypto adoption. So for us, we spend a lot of our time and energy in terms of education, both educating the investors and potential investors, the potential users, but also policymakers, policymakers and enforcement agencies and regulators, because a lot of them have misconceptions about crypto on that front. So we just held an online training program for about 1300 law enforcement agents globally. Very well attended. We teach them loot. Crypto is a traceable technology and you can really use this in a much better way to trace illicit funds to crack down on financial crimes compared to traditional fiat channels. I always tell them this. If you have 100 million today and you start distributing cash, it's very difficult to trace where those cash flow to. But all of us know crypto. We can trace this even if you go through mixers and tumblers."

But again, there's different group of shareholders other than CZ on that front. They are run very independently. I don't really know what's happening on that front, so I'm not the right person to ask on that. With the us resolution for Binance.com, we agree not to serve us customers as part of that resolution. And I think the rest, you know. Right? So we have paid a fine. CZ has agreed to step down. So, and we have a point compliance monitor to me, which is a positive. So we paid a very high price and painful price for this. But the positive coming out from this is that we have compliance monitored with us. It's not only ourselves that attests that we have built a very robust AML KYC program in the last two and a half years. You have somebody else in the company that said, hey, look who have examined their program, and they have really invested a lot. They're on a journey, they are doing all the right things.

We've been covering this a little bit on bank lists, but are not in the details of what is going on with binance executives. More than one, I believe, in Nigeria. I guess I'll just give you a take of what it seems like from our perspective. It seems like the nigerian government has kidnapped binance executives and are now holding them in Nigeria without cause or explanation. And you put out a blog post and I'm probably going to butcher this gentleman's name, but he is a us citizen. Tigran Gamba Ryan. Maybe that's close, is innocent and must be released. This is the title of a blog post that you authored on the Binance website May 7. You said, as you may be aware, one of our beloved colleagues, Tigran Gamba Ryan, continues to be held by a government in Nigeria for more than 70 days. There has not been much public commentary on this episode, and I want to take this opportunity to provide the facts so the global's community's perception may not be distorted unfairly. And then you say this in bold. To invite a company's mid level employees for collaborative policy meetings only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide. What in the world is going on in Nigeria? Like, what is happening here? Can you give it to us in your own words?"

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Sure. So Tigrant has been now detained for more than 90 days. That's an extremely long period of time. He continues to be detained despite our best efforts to get him free. We want to make sure that he's back home safely with his wife and family. And obviously is a very distressful, it's a distressing time for everybody. So that's one. Again, I set out very clearly in my blog. Tigran is a true professional of the highest integrity and his passion is in terms of fighting financial crimes. So it's an irony. He went to Nigeria as a functional expert, not as a negotiator, not as a management person that makes the decision. So it is unfortunate that he is detained. We continue to work very closely with the Nigeria government to secure his release. Also, I think you have seen different media articles coming out that export. The us prosecutors have asked for his release. There are policy makers in the US to say that, look, he has been detained unnecessarily. We will always try to solve problems that we have. If there are problems with any government but that is a function of what we do as a company. But Tigrant shouldn't be used as a tool for unnecessary charges. Okay."

I call on the Biden administration to promptly declare Tigran as wrongfully detained and urge the nigerian government to release him immediately. He was invited to Nigeria by the nigerian government and has done nothing wrong and should be returned home to his family. So. Okay. Binance is active in Nigeria.

Appreciate ongoing updates on that as well, and hoping and praying for his safety. Let's zoom out again for a minute. We talked about, Richard, how you got into crypto is this path of seeing the future of finance and democratizing access to banking tools for the world. And this is a question at bankless. Steven and I have had the privilege to have many of the exchange founders and CEO's on over the years. And in every single conversation, first interview we have with them, we always ask them the question at the root of, why are you here? Really? I know why you got here, but why are you still here? At the root of this question is, what values do you have? Because I think your values as an individual and company really influences the direction you go in the space. I remember Jesse Powell from Kraken, Brian Armstrong. We asked him this question, and their answer was very much around the lines of giving access to decentralized money, tools that just can't be corrupted. Brian tells the story of, you know, some of his formative years he spent in Argentina. And the peso was, like, going wild, and, like, look at this alternative that we have in crypto. And people in Argentina deserve this. I remember we asked the same question of SBF pre all of the chaos when FTX was rising high, and SBF basically said that he was here to make money and give it away. So that was the effective altruism take on it. He said if he could trade orange Grove futures and they have the same growth profile of crypto, then he'd be trading oranges instead of crypto. So he's here to hit the max profit button and then give it away. Coming back to the full circle to this question, Richard, why are you here?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, I think that's a very important and very interesting question. So I count myself as very fortunate in my previous role as regional head of markets. I travel the world quite extensively, including to third world developing frontier marketplace. And it's really in those places that you see how important crypto as a financial instrument is. I talked to many people, including local people that are not into crypto, as well as people that get involved in crypto very early on midstream. And people that just get involved in crypto, I see how much better many of their lives are when they get involved in crypto. For instance, let me give you an example. In many of these places, the currency has gone through huge devaluation because of hyperinflation in the last few years. So anybody with access to crypto, some of the money is into stable coins in terms of preservation of wealth and assets. They are so much better compared to some other people in terms of the payment space. A lot of them have no proper modes of payment, and you can use fiat for things on platforms, electronic platforms, and purchase things, which tends to be much cheaper. Again, crypto becomes that means to allow for mode of transfer, which became extremely important. So I've seen what I call crypto in action, and I see how beneficial it is to the lives of so many people globally, especially in developing and frontier market. So that makes a huge difference to their life. I was once in a developing country, and people don't know who I am. So I just wearing my binance cap. And then this, this young gentleman came up to me. The first question is, do you work for Binance? I said, yes, I do. The person was, like, thanking me profusely. I said, why are you doing that? I said, oh, my brother. It's not him. His brother got into crypto via Binance three years ago, and the family was very poor at that point in time. And then crypto allowed them a chance to get into financial independence. So the whole family was extremely grateful, and he was thanking profusely. He borrowed my cab and said, I want to take a photo of this, show it to my brother. I said, you can keep the cab, it's fine. It means a lot more to you. I can always get another cat. So I've seen how it changes the life of so many people in so many parts of the world. I like to go for our community events. I like to meet our kols, our angels, because they tell me a lot of different stories, again, of different episodes, how it transformed the life of the underprivileged in many different parts of the world. And that really is our key motivation. We want to make sure that people can use money in the way that they wish to, especially people who have no access to the financial system, which is why our mission is support the freedom of money globally. We want to allow people to use assets, money in the way they deem fit, without restrictions, and crypto is the way to do it. The second thing is, crypto is the future, because all the youth and young adults are in it. So if you look at all the different surveys globally, if you ask the young adults, what asset class do you own? Many of them own crypto and not stocks, securities or debt anymore, because it allowed them the chance to gain financial independence. This particular space, which is quite different from many of the other asset classes, they missed a boat on the great growth in many of those other asset classes. But this is nascent and this is developing, so it allows them to get a chance towards financial freedom, financial independence, which is why we are here to support them in that journey. And that gets me excited. These are the two primary reasons."

I completely disagree with them, actually. Have you ever tried to use Fidelity or Schwab or your Wells Fargo banking user interface? To me, crypto, if you've been brought up and you understand how wallets work and private keys, it just is so much more seamless than going to my 401K account in fidelity. The user experience is so much better to send a stablecoin to David than just to figure out how to wire it to his IBAN number and routing and check information and all of this. I've heard this echoed from people we talked to that skew younger, the Gen Zs of the world that are builders in the space. And I remember a conversation with a startup based in India, and to like 1920 year olds, and they were just basically like crypto makes sense. The tradfi system that I have to learn makes no sense to me, and I think it's going to just skew more and more like this."

Setting up a wallet, doing the transfer. But for a person in their fifties and sixties, you have to understand that they are brought up in a different dimension. They are brought up with, I mean, their first investment will be equity or debt securities. Their first interface is what you see in the tradfi interface, which you think is very unusual, friendly, but this is what they're used to. So for a person, I mean, if you look at a younger crowd, hardly anybody goes to a physical bank or make use of the ATM anymore. Everything is going through bank transfer, etcetera. But for a person in their fifties and sixties, to them a bank is, you need to make a physical visit to a banking shop and withdraw money. So again, we are all creatures of our experience. So they grow up in that area, they are brought up that way. Their experience are that you can't quite follow them. And if you ask them to set up a coalette, I think they'll freak out. What exactly is this where I lose all my money, etcetera? Because simply lack of understanding, there's no proper coaching. They are not as tech savvy as many of the young folks. So it's a generation issue, and it's also a knowledge issue on that front. So you can't fault them. But you're right. For people that are so much anger crypto defi, the space makes absolute sense to them. And this is the industry of the future.

Cx and things like a single point of access is so much easier. Many people feel safer, etcetera. So CX will still continue to play a big role. But for crypto natives, if you just do crypto to crypto transactions, for example, a lot of people are relying on Defi. You don't really need CX on that front, but both will continue to grow because there's a natural inhibition for people just to skip from traditional finance to defi, that curve is too steep to cross. The normal curve is people go through CX exposure there. And also it's much easier.

We do have physical meetings, like go and meet regulators, policy makers, community.

So I don't know how you feel about predictions, Richard, but one thing that I think is forefront of everyone's mind in crypto right now is we are in the fourth cycle, the fourth crypto cycle. And traditionally the cycles have been about like four years long. And they go up high in higher and higher and higher, and we get into what our friend Raoul Paul calls the banana zone, and things get absolutely crazy. And then things commonly crash down. We fall down 60, 70, 80%. It feels like we are in the bull cycle, but we haven't quite hit the banana zone of like, going to extremes here. That's if we take the last three cycles and we just kind of extrapolate that forward. Do you think that's how this cycle will play out, or do you think this is different? Like, what are you seeing? I mean, we've never been at, say, 200 million binance users. So at some level, this is a little bit different than where we've been in the past. What's your base prediction?

Last year was not so great, and then market activities start to pick up. Towards the end of last year, we are still relatively early. There are some differences in this particular bull cycle. So normally bitcoin will hit an all time high six months after the halving cycle or six months or after six months after having cycle. This bull cycle is different because bitcoin reached all time high even before the halving. So that is something that was not within my prediction towards the end of last year. I said this in some other forum towards the end of last year. My prediction for end of year bitcoin price for this year is 80,000. And possibly, I think 2025 is going to be an even better year than 2024 for crypto industry in general, because the general macroeconomics condition will be much better. We are probably going to see interest rate reduction towards the end of this year. There's going to be a much better macroeconomic environment, much more enlightened interest rate environment. I think all those will boost crypto prices even further in 2025. My base prediction end of 2023 was 80,000 this year, 120,000 by next year. But what I didn't predict was the strong, robust inflows from the institutions after the launch of ETF. I didn't expect the ETF to be approved so quickly, so early on in the year. My prediction for ETF approval was possibly towards the end of 2024 or even 2025. Right. So I think I have changed my prediction because of that. My price for end of this year is much higher than 80,000. I'm not going to give you the price, but it's much higher than my base price end of last year. And I think next year will be a much better year compared to this year. That's my view. You have seen a lot of analysts coming out, including from standard Charter, to say that by next year bitcoin should reach 200,000. If there's a squeeze, it should reach a quarter of a million dollars. I think there's still some room to grow both for bitcoin as well as tokens such as ether, where the ETF has just been approved. Again, with all this approval of ETF, it brings new liquidity, new user pool. I mentioned 15 billion has flown into the bitcoin ETF since the beginning of the year after their approval, and that's very robust. We will continue to see pretty robust institutional demand on that front, and that is really very beneficial for the crypto community."

So bitcoin has reached all time high, but the total crypto market cap has not. We're just under our previous all time high. Where do you think the total crypto market cap ends up at the end of the cycle?"

        "text": "Another unique feature of this particular cycle. Of course, we are still very early on in the cycle, so we have not seen the full cycle into play. But something that's pretty unique in this cycle. If you remember the past cycle, normally it starts off with bitcoin rallying, and then it filters down to the other mega coins, so to say. And then slowly it goes down to the meme coins. This cycle sort of was focused on bitcoin and that meme coins, skipping coins straight to the end. So this is unique in this particular cycle, is unique in that sense as well. Which is something that I don't think we have quite seen in previous cycle. I don't remember it, but I may be wrong, but I don't think I. We have seen it in previous cycles, so it is quite unique. I do think that the market cap will more than easily double where it is today. That's my view. How many more times than that? Three times, four times. It's very difficult to have a crystal ball to predict that. But again, these are my own view, not financial advice. It will easily more than double from where we are."

Maybe one of my last questions is, I know Binance has a lot of like investors, traders, that sort of thing. That's a Persona that Binance has attracted over the years and does a lot of volume. Do you have any just general advice for them or just thoughts for traders, for investors on how they can do well in this market, how to avoid mistakes? What would you say to a trader that just puts up their hand and says, richard, just like, like, tell me how to do this better? What should I do?"

If there are any areas of improvement, please feel free to escalate them. Let me know, let the rest of the team know. We will try our best to make sure that we do right and we do much better.

So I buy and hold. So I really admire people that can do fantastic trading, but I guess some of the fundamentals will apply. You have different form of traders, you have quant, you have people that do algo, etcetera, high frequency trading, but they are experts at what they do and not me. You probably need to speak to them to find out how to make money in this cycle, but I've seen many traders doing extremely well. I'm very grateful for their support and hope they continue to support us and do more business with us."

        "text": "Richard, actually, I do have one last question, because I think many listeners still have some PTSD from last cycle where a major crypto exchange that they trusted, that they had faith in, that they had funds on, went completely under, and it turned out had been using the depositors funds to go. You speculate on crypto markets. That was a very traumatic experience for a lot of people in crypto, and you are the largest exchange right now in the world, binance. And there's a lot of funds being custodied in binance. What can you say about assurances of those funds? Keep in mind, when you say that, I think in crypto, hopefully we learned our lesson in 2022, and we're moving to a trust but verify type of model. So we heard Sam Bankman Freed say a lot of things, too. So just like, words are great, but they're also not sufficient. What kind of measures have you put in place? What sort of proof can a listener see when they're using binance? That their funds are safu, that their funds are actually secure?"

        "text": "Trust us based on our action, right? We are not the flashy type. We don't go out saying that, you know, flowery words, but we have been very consistent in our actions. So user funds are sacrosanct. They are back one to one. And that is a fundamental principle from day one when binance is set up, as I mentioned, user protection, user assets, safety, security. At the heart of what we do, we make sure that those are being protected. Other than Safu fund, we also publish things like proof of reserve. We have expanded the number of coins that's covered by proof of reserve. We published them. Binance as an entity, we are very prudent in terms of our operations, so you don't see us slashing out big sponsorship. We are financially prudent, making sure that whatever money goes back to supporting the community, supporting our users need, making sure that we are robust. And truth is, we are regulated. We are the most regulated exchange. We are regulated in 18 different jurisdictions. We are under close scrutiny by the us regulators for a prolonged period of time. So they have made up various allegations at us, but I think there are two allegations that were, I think, very clear. There's never any allegation that we misappropriated user fund and there's never allegation of market manipulation. So they scrutinize our operations very closely for a prolonged period of time. But these things are things that are very sacrosanct. We make sure that there's trust in the community. We place a lot of emphasis in terms of protecting user assets and making sure that safety, soundness, fairness of the marketplace are very important to make sure that we run a platform where different users can trust. So the rest of Australia on that front, I mean, I can tell you this, but we are scrutinized very heavily by global regulators on that front as well."

        "text": "Yeah, I think my personal perspective on this is if something was amiss, then the regulators would have found it in the last two years as they were digging very much into binance. One action item though, for you, bankless nation, is if you have funds on any exchange, I encourage you to look at their proof of reserves policy. We will include a link to the binance proof of reserve policy in the show notes and go look at that for yourself. Look for on chain types of attestations. These are some crypto native tools that we can use for proof of reserves. Richard, it has been fantastic to finally meet you. Congrats on the role. We look forward to big things from binance in the years to come and your continued mission to onboard the world, to crypto. Thank you so much for spending the last hour with us."
