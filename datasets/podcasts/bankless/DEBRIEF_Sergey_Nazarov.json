Because we hadn't had a strong thesis around decentralized oracle networks. And it very much seemed at the time that the frog army. At that time.

You remember the immaculate IcO. Like, you can never repeat the Ethereum ICos. It was immaculate. All further icos are tainted by. By bad incentives. Yeah, I'll give chainlink the benefit of, like, it was kind of like the immaculate frog army. Like, it was the first one, and it was organic and real. There are conspiracies that it might not have been so organic, but I think that's all conspiracy. So, yeah, the immaculate frog ception of chain link. All further frog armies past chain link, I've deemed as, like, well, now you're just playing the game. Shout out, avalanche. And so, like, those have been like, well, now you know that that's a strategy and you've tried to corrupt it. But, like, the chain link frog army, I think, just emerged out of four chan because of the fundamentals of chain link. Like, they rallied around the shelling point."

But that was almost overshadowed back in 2020 by this very rabid tribe in a crypto, specifically Twitter. Twitter social. That made it hard to have a coherent conversation about chain link itself and isolate the technology from the token. That is."

And chain Link, it feels much healthier to have a conversation in 2023, it probably would have been healthy, like, last year, even late 2021, but we just haven't gotten around to it until now. Here we are. I think that there is basically, look, it's very simple. There's just a need for a connector, some glue between banking systems and swift and crypto and blockchain. What Chainlink is doing is creating middleware for those two things, messaging and data middleware. It's as simple as that. They can do the beady b two b, and focus on Swift and focus on the DTcC, and they can kind of unite these two tribes and these two communities. And it seems like it's a pretty technically sophisticated take. I've seen a lot of crypto projects not only adopt Chainlink, the oracle, for defi pricing, but is it synthetix that is using CCIP?"

One of my hesitations about having Sergey on is that he was just gonna come give us his stump speech, which I feel like is what he did. Other people, when we, like, are they more adaptable? They're more flexible. The show is more unique. It's. The bankless show is the bankless version of whatever this episode is. But I think we just. I feel like if we could cut up other pieces of Sergei's podcasts in different venues or talks or whatever, and then you could, like, okay, now, like."

I mean, I think he's obviously, he's also a masterful not only executor, but, like, marketer. I think they've done a very good job in terms of packaging decentralized Oracle networks and birthing the industry and making them what they are today, and they've really crushed it. Name another Oracle network competitor, Layer zero. This is only on the interoperability side of things, by the way, one thing I didn't get a chance to ask is, how is CCIP and interoperability and cross chain interoperability related to Oracle networks? It feels like it's a different product offering in some ways."

There's no pure interoperability between, like, unless you're, like, you have to be on the same level of communication, like IBC.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. And as the data becomes more valuable, it becomes more trust minimized because more people will pay for that data and then therefore more nodes are incentivized. I did like how he talked in his five levels of security. That's just sharding. Like first you have a central database, then you have a distributed database, then you have a decentralized network, which is like bitcoin or Ethereum. And then you have multiple decentralized networks, which is ethereums roll up centric roadmap. And then you have level five, which is you produce the uniform output of that. Everything kind of comes back and points towards CCIP, which in the Ethereum landscape is like, how do we actually achieve composability in our sharded layer two roadmap, which is the Ethereum's problem, but like the, it maps on directly to Ethereum's roll up centric roadmap."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. What do you think of the idea of the, the bankers coming to crypto and kind of tying these systems together? Do you think that there's enough carrot for them?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Probably, yeah. I mean, he made his case of just like banks are super profit maxi and if they can package up assets and securitize them, and they can do that more with the more expressivity of blockchain ledgers over bank ledgers, then they'll find a way to do that. I think it makes sense that Chainlink allows them to stay in the cozy comfort of their own centralized ledger home and still take advantage of crypto tokenization. So that checks out to me just out of gut take."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, that's somewhat of what I always thought. And there's always this chicken, there's kind of a discussion of, well, the banks won't come until the regulators green line it, but actually I think it works the opposite. Once the banks have a profit motive, they will lobby the regulators. And the revolving door of regulators is basically like Goldman Sachs. Where did Gary Gensler used to work? It's like Goldman Sachs. That's how it kind of works. So if you give a big enough win for the bankers, then they will push the regulators in whatever direction that they want. This is, by the way, why I'm very certain that we'll get a ETF. BlackRock now wants a bitcoin spot ETF, so now it's going to happen. It's a shame that the system works this way, but that's kind of how it works. So I actually think if you create a big enough win for the traditional banking system, then they'll push the regulators along. And if they don't like what these are, multinational global institutions. Right. And so they'll say, well, we can do this in Europe or we can do this in Hong Kong or some other jurisdiction, and we can't do it in America. So we'll just go do it over there. So they'll get their way. All the regulators can do is like, put the brakes on it. So I do think that's how you solve the chicken and egg problem, is you give the carrot, like there's a big enough carrot for it. The banks. Now there's a larger question, though, of like, do they then come and corrupt the existing, you know, system of crypto and they can't, does it become banker control?"

        "text": "DTC well, Tradfi is one single ledger like the central bank of America has a larger ledger than Ethereum in terms of TVL, but there's only one read write access to the central bank. So it's actually very small in that sense. But even there's many different ways to define the size of a ledger in this parameter that I just made up in the intro to the show."

So in your travels, Chainlink has basically won the, I think right now anyway, the price Oracle game, decentralized price Oracle game. But they're still very early in trying to win the chain interoperability solution, and there have been a lot of companies that have recently raised and deployed against this strategy. So CCIP is. There are a mix of other competitors like Lear Zero is one. How much have you explored? Kind of the multi chain interoperability space and. Yeah.
