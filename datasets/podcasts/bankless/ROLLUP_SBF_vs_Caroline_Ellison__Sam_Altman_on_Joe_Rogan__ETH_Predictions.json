And Lyn's comment was, that's how a lot of countries live right now. I'm talking about kind of in western developed nations, right. In Europe, what if this is the new normal in Canada, in Australia, what if this is the new normal in the US? What if this is the new normal? She mentioned she was just in Egypt. 30% annual inflation, and people just live like that. And so what do you do when you're in a high inflation type of environment? Well, you tend to spend more. You might want to. You might be willing to take out more cheap debt. If you can find it in fiat that's nominated in fiat, you might want to hold your money in other things, you know, real estate in a lot of emerging countries that don't have strong capital markets like the US, stocks for, you know, western developed countries like the US.

Yeah, there was like a 45 day wait queue to get into the beacon chain to stake their eth a while ago, we have finally approached an equilibrium. That acceleration of people depositing into proof of stake has finally started to come down. And so it's currently less than 24 hours to deposit your ETH into the beacon chain staking contract and get your ether staking. And so this inevitably was going to, this was never going to be up only, of course, like, you know, not all ether is going to stake. And so we are have found the equilibrium. That equilibrium is around 27.3 million staked ether. That's 22.7%, which is about the 20% to 30% range that we predicted. So about 3.5% APR is about what the market wants, and if that goes down, then people won't want it anymore. And that this is the equilibrium that we have finally arrived at. Cool."

I think, like, just straight up losing money and also some other shenanigans. But, like, the idea of Alameda, the myth around Alameda was they were just printing money, and they were just, like, extremely lucrative prop trading shop. Yeah. So turns out they were shit traders because they were kids at the wheel and they didn't know what they were doing. And Alameda would, like, keep on tapping into FTX's customer deposits, and they would have. There was, like, a number, and the whole premise here was that Alameda FTX allowed Alameda's trading account to go negative. And this is. This is just giving them a line. A line of credit.

So Genesis asked Caroline Ellison if she could provide documentation of Alameda's financials. Just doing proper due diligence. Ellison said that she was worried that providing accurate financials would show that Alameda was far too risky to be able to, like, lend money towards. So the pair, Aris Ellison and SPF, devised strategies to improve the looks of Alameda's financial positions. So at the direction of SBF, says Caroline, she produced seven different balance sheet reports. So, like, seven different versions of looking at the truth.

FTX did not have $9.9 billion in profits, and so they need to cover up that hole. Interestingly, $4.5 billion from Alameda's balance sheet was made into venture investments by executives. So that's SBF. That's Caroline Ellison, that's Gary Wang. And like, I think one other $4.5 billion. Why do they do it in their own personal names? Uncertain, perhaps tax advantage reasons? Uncertainty. So the alt seven report labeled this $4.5 billion, as on their balance sheet, as a long term asset, not risky venture capital investments. They just wrote it off like, hey, we invested $4.5 billion. These are long term assets. I mean, venture is long term. It's dubious to call venture investing a long term asset, but I guess if you spray and pray $4.5 billion, you're going to get something out of it. Which is also a story for the show. We'll talk about anthropic. Anyways, that $4.5 billion of venture capital was subtracted from the $9.9 billion of customer funds from FTX. Oh, I also missed the line in Maine. In the main report, there was a line item called FTX borrows, and it was $9.9 billion. That's the thing that they were like, well, that can't be shown."

So instead of $9.9 billion of customer liabilities, which are at risk of being called forward at any moment, because, again, if you're running exchange, you're supposed to be fully liquid, instead, turned that into a 5.5 billion long term liability.

We're like, well, this can't be. They had a billion dollars of locked capital on these two exchanges, on their trading accounts, and so they really needed to get this capital off, and so they just, like, slammed heads and was like, how do we get this? How do we get our money back? So one idea was that they would make further OKX trading accounts, fake trading accounts, using the idea of thai prostitutes. So somehow they got a bunch of thai prostitute ids, and they made trading accounts, and the strategy was that Alameda would both control their own account. They could trade on the. On the exchange, they just couldn't withdraw. So they could make trades. They just couldn't withdraw the money. And so they made some fake accounts using these thai prostitute ids, and their plan was to make just absolute dog shit trades, and then the thai prostitutes would take the other end of that other end of that trade, and it would effectively be a transfer of capital from one account to another, and they would be able to withdraw. That didn't work. Surprise. But they legitimately tried to do this. Another, a chinese employee of FTX attempted to broker a connection, a deal between a chinese official who they could bribe with $150 million, which they ultimately went through with.

Saying this, the guest was saying this. Yes. Uh, just one side of Lido, the lido debate, the other then we recently had on Danny Ryan was saying, hey, Lido's bad. It's too centralized, is too. We should be concerned about a lido going over 33% right now. Right now. Yeah. Perhaps, perhaps it's an attack right now in Ethereum, this is like kind of the bear market fight that we are currently going through. Is Lido good or is it bad?

        "text": "Shades of gray. So on one hand, Lido's roadmap clearly prioritizes decentralization. It is going to be a decentralized protocol. On the other hand, Lido financially benefits from the centralization of stake. So that's one variable. On one side of things, Lido can launch an attack on Ethereum consensus, but in reality, the outcomes are that Ethereum survives and Lido dies. Another variable, Lido, is composed of 30 plus node operators, which is decentralized, it's distributed, but also Dao governance is a tool to coordinate cartel behavior. So dao governance is the one centralized factor. Next, some amount of moralistic pressure may be unavoidable. So like the anti Lido faction is just going to exist, but. And also leaning too hard into altruism and social enforce enforcement is damaging. Social enforcement, I think, is perhaps one way to view a violation of credible neutrality is a way to articulate this. And then lastly, there's a willingness in ethereum to improve the LST foundation. Liquids taking token foundation with layer one changes, changes to the layer one. Aka like protocol enshrined. Yes. And then on the other hand, pragmatism while considering the effects of enshrinement. This was like Vitalik's recent post about how we choose to enshrine something. Yeah, so Mike is just talking about the various attack vectors and the reality and the pragmatism about like, okay, sure, Lido could totally attack ethereum, but why would it do that? That would be dumb and bad for Lido. Like kind of nuanced stuff like this. Great post. Great post."

How, how do you, David Hoffman, contain your excitement right now?"

Like, it is so contrarian to be a crypto investor, to be in crypto in this present moment while prices are just going down, down, down. And so the bullish signals. We had Eric B on talking about the bitcoin and ether ETF's, which Tldr he just said soon tm like 75% chance of bitcoin ETF before the end of the year and the ether ETF as a fast follow. Wow. Was not expecting that level of bullishness. Crypto prices are down. Like, so many things are happening. The risk to reward for crypto is like, been up only all bear market. And especially with prices, like in the absolute doghouse. I am so bullish. However, you can't just be bullish all the time. It's fatiguing. It's very fatiguing. And you need to, like, the market will be weird and against your opinion for longer than you will be able to have, like, over outsized exposure to crypto. So just because we all think it's going to be bullish season sometime soon, like, you have to be patient. The cool thing that was the bull market of 2020 pre 2021 is that anyone who was in crypto in 2019 saw the 2021 bull market happening in 2020. We had, like six months of crescendoing excitement and activity that was defi summer that led into NFT mania and ETH price. The blue chips, bitcoin price almost didn't do anything. They really didn't do anything. They kind of went up. Like, bitcoin ether broke above $360 and went up to $480, which, like we all knew is like, yo, it's on. Like, we haven't seen $400 in two and a half years. It's on. And then, like two months later, we were at $1,700 or something where we are now, but we had six months of, like, very strong indications of crypto is in before the blue chips rantaine. And so, like, I think what I'm saying is, like, you know, be excited and be patient. Uh, it will take time. It'll probably take more time than you think, but things will get excited, exciting again before prices move. If we are pattern matching between 2019, does that make sense? Do you agree?"

And then you get rewarded with diva tokens for putting TVL into the diva vaults. And then diva swaps the staked ether for Diva ether and gives you back tokens. So it's incentivizing, it's an economic incentive for you to take Lido's TVL and put it in divas vaults and you'll get Diva tokens for it."

They are trying to be one to one compatible with Ethereum. That's kind of their strategy. Diva is doing something very similar with Ethereum staking. So it uses a lot of these same infrastructure of Ethereum staking as a microcosm of Ethereum. So it's like a fractal spin off, a mini version of grander Ethereum proof of stake inside of the diva vaults. What do I mean by this? How does it work? Diva uses DVT distributed validator technology, aka squad staking. And they make a, and they have the diva contracts. And you as a validator who can run a node can permissionlessly, unlike Lido, permissionlessly enter the diva registrar with just one ether as collateral. And you run a node and using DVT, you band together with others to produce a staking validator. When it's time for Diva to produce a block. And so there's this band of diva validators that have at least one, one ether of capital, and they register with the diva contract by submitting the ether into their contracts and then using DVT. When diva is called upon to produce a block for Ethereum, 16 independent validators come together to create a virtual node. This is how DVT works.

So it's repurposing and reusing components of Ethereum staking to produce diva staking with this one very core piece of unlock technology, which is DVT. And so lido curates professional validators that have their one job of being having high uptime, and it's curated and permissioned to professionals, to the experts. DVT is that technology that democratizes that power to the masses, where if one of the 16 people that come together, or three or five of them are down because they're amateurs because of DVT, you only need parts of that squad to sign off and everyone is up. And so it's, it's how you get 99.999% uptime because you have redundancy without dual slashing risk. So it is a technically, in my mind, my opinion, technically superior protocol that is also executing a vampire attack upon Lido, which is why I'm bullish."

It reminds me of, do you remember 2019, 2020, when we were floating in this range of between, it was like 150 and like 200, 250 type that range, and it felt like we were there forever. 1600 is like the new 200 to me."

But that to me is parallels between, like 153 hundred where it felt like we were floating there forever. And I, and like, I think when you're evaluating the price of eth, you have to ask yourself of, like, is it going to go down again? Right? And the answer to that is, yeah, it could totally spike down. I mean, we could get to a thousand we could go even below 1000. Macro could go crazy as well. But I guess I'm just feeling echoes of the last fractal pattern of the 200 to 300 range. Except this time there's no existential, like, are we going to make it? Type of crisis. There's, like, more building, there's more block space, there's more money printing going on than ever before. And yeah, I think it's a very bullish good time to start, if you haven't already, buying ether. And I remember a series of tweets I started making within this price range of, like, ethat 200 is hilarious. And I kept tweeting this out as it would hit 220 and it would go higher and higher. I'm almost at that stage where I feel like the price of ETH is just very low relative to the potential. Almost there. It's almost stupid. It's almost stupid. One other thing I was thinking of with ether in general is, are we investing in ETH, David, because we're uber optimistic or because we're uber pessimistic, or."

So this is a take that I gave on the premium feed. I think we, during 2021, you and I were just like, ultrasound money, ultrasound money. Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to. Maybe we kind of over indexed on that. Maybe that was exhausting for the listeners. Why do we focus on the burn so much? Is it because when ETH burn. It goes, number go up. And that's what we want because we're here for the money. Or are we looking at the argentine peso inflate at 150% a year, the turkish ilira inflate over 100% a year. You, the United States dollar has a destiny to inflate. And we are looking at people's savings being like eaten away either slowly inside the United States or extremely rapidly everywhere else. We're watching just the GDP of global economies fall apart as a result of this, entering low trust societies as a result of fiscal mismanagement at best and corruption at worst, which leads to more inflation. So when we see Ethereum, the protocol, having economic surplus and taking that surplus and putting it back into the money via the burn, and we are increasing the savings of the user base, the holder base of ether, as a direct inverse relationship to the decay of people savings and the decay of the fiscal situation in the United States. That is why we celebrate the burn. It is the. Is the same reason why we shit on inflation is why we celebrate the burn. It is a, it's a benefit to the savers, to the widest possible distribution of the ethereum network, the ether holders. It is something to celebrate. It is something optimistic. It is a reason to be optimistic about the future we are putting back. We are strengthening our economy. And so it's not just number go up, it is the inversion of the things that we are bearish about in society. That's why we celebrate the burn."
