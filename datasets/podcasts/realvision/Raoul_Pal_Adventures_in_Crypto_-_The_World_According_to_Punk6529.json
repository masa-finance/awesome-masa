        "text": "I came across crypto seriously for the first time in summer of 2013. Sure, I had actually come across bitcoin in 2011, but didn't take it seriously enough. I was thinking, oh, look, this is for the people who want to keep gold bars in their basement because the government's going to take their guns or something. Right. It had that aesthetic in 2011 and it was painful mistake. I didn't take it seriously. It came back on my radar screen in 2013. And in 2013 I read the white paper and I said, oh, oh, that's a big deal. I downloaded a node. I bought my first bitcoin. I called up a buddy who lived on the other side of the planet and told him to download a node and I sent him $20 worth of bitcoin. And thats fine. Thats probably 0.2 bitcoin. Back then. It was interesting because I was in New York, then he was in Europe. It was Saturday afternoon. And if you wanted to send a wire transfer to Europe on Saturday afternoon, of course you cant. Youre waiting till Monday. Depending on where its going, if its running through a correspondent bank, it will be there on Wednesday, most likely. And the wire transfer fees themselves are going to be $30. And so we're sitting there, we're playing around with it and said, all right, I'm sending you $20. And it's just there. And I said, oh, that's really interesting. It's kind of surprising how that worked. And then I started getting really into it. And I don't know how much the audience you remember from that era, but there was fall 2013 was kind of the first blossoming of crypto Twitter. It's when it started going mainstream's not the right word, but it's when a lot of the, I think the big thinkers on crypto Twitter coalesced in that period. And so it was a very intellectually fertile period when we went from being like, well, what is this and what does it do and what does it all mean? Right? And for me, the conclusion then was not that this is a great way to send remittances. I mean, it is sure. Or, oh, it's an inflation hedge. And I mean, sure, that's fine, but there's other inflation hedges in the world, right? It's not the only way you can hedge inflation. It was a much deeper idea, and it's a much deeper idea technically, but it's a much deeper idea socially. The technical deeper idea is the following. It has solved, under certain parameters, a major problem in distributed systems, in computer science, the byzantine generals problem, how people who don't know each other, who don't trust each other, can coordinate, can agree on a set of facts. That is a very, very big deal. That's number one. The implication of that, though, is you now have in a digital era, which is we've been in a digital era for decades, you now have a way where you can have store a set of information not in the database. And this was my big aha. Moment from even back then, where you don't think about it. But all modern society runs on databases. Your life is organized by thousands of databases. Which hotel you can check into, which uber you can step into, where you're allowed to vote, how much money is in your bank account, how much money is in your stock broker account. Literally thousands of databases organized your life. It is something that's happened in the last 50 years. Before computers, before widespread computers, and before the Internet. This was not as important a part of human society. And now it is integral for running any modern society. Any modern society runs on a database connected to the Internet, and in fact, thousands of databases connected to it. We take it for granted as completely obvious, because there's really the only way to do it. And what that means is that there are thousands of ttps around you, trusted third parties, people who you're in effect, trusting as a counterparty for some set of information. That set of information is how much money is in your bank account, or do you own this piece of property? Or are you a citizen of this republic? And like most centralized systems, it works okay. Centralized systems most of the time are better. And this is, I think, one of the things that a lot of people get wrong early in crypto, you're even seeing this now with big Web two CEO's who are saying, well, no, if I were to use a blockchain for anything, it's slower, it's more expensive, it's this? Look at my super fast database running on Amazon Web services. All that's true, of course. That's of course not the point. The point is not about how many transactions per second you have. The point is, what are the structural social implications of this? And the structural social implications of these are, generically, you're trusting someone. And specifically, as we have become progressively digital, you're trusting a smaller number of larger entities. One of the big surprises of the Internet for anyone who was around the first go around to me is the following. I remember, I was just old enough to remember when the Internet started becoming prominent and the whole idea was going to decentralize everything. Look, you don't have to be the New York Times to publish online, right? Anyone can publish online. And that turned out you don't have to be Walmart to sell things online. Anyone can sell online. And while that's true, and initially you had a lot of small businesses because there are no distribution barriers online, you ended up with bigger oligopolies than you had offline. And so the Internet tends to be somehow at the application level, centralizing big data, machine learning tends to be centralizing. Theres economies of scale, theres economies of scope, theres economies of data. All of this leads to centralization. And then blockchains appear, bitcoin appears. Really blockchains, bitcoin say, oh, so thats like, I mean, among other things, a bank account without a bank, and its a bank being run by a bunch of people who dont know each other and dont need to know each other and dont need to accept for certain assumptions, dont need to trust each other. My conclusion very early on was this is a 30 40 year big deal. You can re architect whole chunks of how society works with us. We suddenly have a second tool in the digital air before we have one tool. A great tool, an amazing tool. The database is a great tool. This is not like everything should be on a blockchain. In fact, there was once a graphic that was an infographic that says decision tree. It's the question, should this be in a blockchain? If you'd have to ask, the answer is no. Blockchain is not an all purpose replacement for all databases. Databases make a lot of sense in many cases, but they might be a replacement for the important things. So this and I have both a traditional finance background, I have a software development background. I have a big corporate background, let's say. But I've also been since 2013, quite active in the crypto world and quite active in education, outreach, advocacy, reaching out to people, this type of thing. I believe the types of things you see on my Twitter account now are the things that I've been harassing everyone about for eight years. It's just now under a different handle. One of the things that was frustrating me though, through spirit, bitcoin and then ethereum and then the whole ecosystem succeeded financially, I think, beyond anyones wildest dreams. In 2013, the types of numbers people thought wed see 20 years from now, in 2013, we saw five and seven and eight. And so the number went up. Everyone was happy. This is great. I kept getting stuck on the following. I would have this discussion over and over and over again with my friends in the crypto world. Okay, so what other applications have we built? Why? I have at times run organizations of different sizes, including fairly sizable ones, and I wake up in the morning and say, well, I believe in this more than anything else. How can I use crypto at work? Dancer 1 second I mean, how can I use bitcoin at work? I can't really. I mean, it's a payment system. Okay, but like, is it the right answer of this application? No, the database is the right answer to the application. So you say, well, I feel there's a there there. I feel there's another turn there. And of course, Ethereum smart contracts has another term and Defi has another term, but theyre still not exactly hitting core societal systems. Thats the background, lets say through a year and a half. Thats the intellectual background through a year and a half ago. Let me take a pause there, see if that makes sense."

It was 2012, probably saw it in 2011. 2012, I started properly digging into it, and I come through the lens of almost losing the european banking system after wed almost lost the global banking system in 2008. And I realized very quickly that bitcoin itself was interesting, but the blockchain itself was going to offer a whole lot."

And then, okay, well, what you can start to put on the blockchain, what's relevant and what's not. As you said, that journey was a journey where I realized, like you, that it was okay, that in 20 1415 there weren't that many applications because we knew theyd come. It was just a matter of when I think your journey super interesting because your mixed background, it gives you a massive advantage in this space. I was not a technologist. I had to get up some of the curve of that. I was a finance guy. But you having that mixed background must have been a huge help. 18 months ago. NfTs, which we all knew about. Any of us have been around the space for a while. We knew about, but it came in a different format than many of us first thought. I thought it might be through property or some sort of other form of IP, but it didnt talk me through that realization when the world suddenly changed again."

And it wasn't until I can't tell you exactly what the trigger was. I don't remember now, but I remember towards the end of 2020, I started getting that spidey sense and I started harassing all of my crypto friends, including some who are just like true crypto ogs. And like, I think there's something important here. And they're like, no, it's stupid, right? That's cartoons. Like, it's, you know, let's look at this new blockchain that does whatever, right? And I'm saying, okay. And I kept, and then I'd wait a month, and then it was still nagging at me. And then finally I said, I need to spend time on it. It's bothering me. And I thought, let's go buy some nfts. And the very first nft I bought was zero one eth or something. It was just like, let me just buy the cheapest nft I can buy on Opensea and see how I feel. I was like, oh, that was interesting. That was fun. Let me buy another one. Well, okay, that feels pretty good. Let me buy another one. And then I started bringing, hold on."

I think one of the huge gaps we have with traditional system people and with regulators, theyve never done it. Their image of what bitcoin is, their image of what web three is, their image of what nfts are, is this wholly distorted image. I didnt know if I wanted to invest in nfts, and I just wanted to spend some time. I dont even remember what the first was. It was some pixelated character, because of course it was. But it was the furthest thing from an important collection. It was not, let's go buy grail nfts. It's let me play around and open suit for a bit. And what started happening was the following. And this was a very new experience, as I would grab a friend of mine, a family member, and will say, hey, let's try this. Pick something. I'll buy it here, set up a metamask. I'll send it to you and send it back to me. What I realized within a month, this is crypto's consumer moment. It is a well known truism and technology. The technologies become consumerized when you stop talking about the technology. I have spent eight years trying to convince people of the joys of decentralization. The whole time I've had this thought in the back of my mind, like, I know this is wrong. I can't tell you why it's wrong, but I know it's wrong because I'm talking about the byzantine general's problem. I know it's wrong because we're discussing the differences between how Solana reaches consensus and how ethereum reaches consensus. And of course, I personally find it very interesting. But this is nerd stuff, right? This is not consumer stuff. One of the ways I think about it, Instagram users ensure python and machine learning and cloud computing and routers and servers. But no one in the history of the world said, hey, you should use this cool Instagram app. It uses Python. That's not how consumer tech works. And what I noticed for the very first time in crypto here we were absolutely using decentralized rails. True crypto, ethereum, web, three applications, and we weren't talking about the tech, except for the basic ramp up curve. Here's how metamask works. Once we got past that, it was, oh, this one's cool. That's one cool. I want the one with a silly hat. I want this photograph."

        "text": "Correct. But that's tech in and of itself isn't interesting, right? Tech is interesting to meet human needs. And so I was like, oh, wow, this is it. This is the positive way to say it. The classic way to say it is this is how crypto consumerizes the kind of inside baseball way to think about it. This could be a Trojan horse for decentralized rails. We know this. Eight years in, no one cares about decentralization per se. And I say this, and it's a harsh statement, but it's true."

        "text": "I think if you went and checked even the large majority of Twitter crypto, Silicon Valley thought leaders on decentralization have the majority of their crypto in Coinbase custody or something, which means everyone's larking everyone. You can't say, I care about decentralization and say, oh, I am the third party custodian. The threat model is exactly the same as being at JP Morgan. There's no difference. That is, bitcoin is a financial investment, not bitcoin, as a different way to organize things. Bitcoin as a financial investment has been extremely fruitful to early bitcoin people, right? But with the exception of, and it's funny because the bitcoin maxi narrative has been in some ways hijacked relative to what it is in my mind, right? The maxi narrative is like, I don't know, the today maxi narrative is that all other coins are scams and we have to all eat steaks or something, right? That's not the bitcoin maxi narrative. The bitcoin maxi narrative is you need to run your own node. You need to be self sovereign. You need to do the education to learn how to be responsible for yourself. Those OG bitcoiners I have infinity respect for because theyre the only ones who are actually doing it. Theres a lot of people who say, oh, bitcoins are good investment, but none of them are actually doing this. And its interesting. Ill flag this because itll be interesting as we get through the rest of this. Up until late last year, I think this is shocking to some people, including some bitcoiners who come across my feed and then I cant believe hes buying winky photos or something. I was close to, from a portfolio allocation perspective a year and a half ago, close to a bitcoin max. It has been through eight years of altcoins, icos, other things. About the only thing that has gotten me to sell bitcoin is nfts. It's interesting. I flagged that. I flagged that. So consumerization, now consumerization has another aspect. The first aspect is that people like it and it's not about the technology. The second aspect that's very, very different is that every organization on the planet has an incentive to mint an NFT. So I was in and around nft NYC. I didn't go to the conference for obvious reasons, but I was around and I went to the Dolce Gabbana party. And the interesting thing, that was the most interesting thing about the conference because specifically there was a Dolce Gabbana party. I've been to many crypto conferences. Dolce Gabbana does not show up to like Ethereum conferences."

And Dolce Gabbana has an incredible brand equity. They have a customer base. And so they can monetize that with a 90 something percent gross margin product, as they did and as they should have. And Nike bought Artifact Adidas did their job. We're going to have every single fashion lifestyle company issue nfts in the coming months and years. It will then roll over to the consumer packaged goods companies. Youll have a QR code on your six pack of coke. Youll scratch it. Youll get an NFT. Why? Because then they can directly airdrop you a coupon for the two to one sale. They know you bought it in Atlanta. They know who bought that coke can they know if youve used the coupon, theyre not going to put in the classified newspaper the inset like, well move to the 21st century. Universities will do it for their alumni base. Sports teams will do it for their fans. Eventually, in the fullness of time, you'll be in the local barbecue pit Masters club and you will get the barbecue master of the month NFT in your wallet. Everyone's coming. Over the course of the decade, everyone is going to have many, many nfts. And I think it's important to note here the average NFT in your wallet is not going to be a grail Fedenza or whatever. It's going to be something closer to your Chipotle coupon card. But it doesn't matter. Like these two things mean there will be widespread adoption unless something goes wrong, which we'll talk about in the later section. So thesis one, it's a consumer application."

That's what really got me interested, and I've been very interested in social tokens and nfts for community as the new business model. And it creates a wholly different dynamic when you have combined network effects between your consumers or your network of users and yourself or your business."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Well, here is, this isn't in my mega thesis, but here's, here's a framework to thinking about this. I think of nfts in the variation you spoke about as two things. First of all, it's a community interest group where the database is publicly readable and writable. What do I mean by that? We don't know or need to know who all the punks holders are, but there's probably some psycho demographics that apply to them. And those are different psychodemographics that apply to bourdain holders, which is different than Azuki holders. And that's no different than the world at large. Right? If you're in the database of the Catholic Church, you're statistically not an individual basis, but an aggregate. Different than someone that's in the database. Lutheran church, but an individual might be. Not that, but an aggregate. You are. The difference is the punks database is publicly composable. You can not be a punk holder, you cannot be ugalabs now, and you can still write an application that air drops something to a punk or composes a punk or allows you to interact with that community. So first kind of version of this is it's turning community groups and membership groups inside out. They're sitting there in public as opposed to being hidden. And anytime something goes in public and is composable, it becomes a much bigger deal. The other part though that comes from the non fungibility is you can represent much more complex social structures with nfts than you can with fungible tokens. Non fungible tokens, arguably are a superset of functional tokens, not a subset. Right. Because if I made every single NFT the same, it's a fungible token. I think of doge as an open edition, one piece of art. NFT, right? Right. But with NFT is you can actually represent, and I have dozens of real life ideas that random organizations run. Organizations. Well, because you can get granular. You can represent granular roles in a way you cant with bitcoin."

Like the activity feed its every couple of minutes, all day long someones throwing an NFT. This thing is a temporary problem because in the exact same way as we were able to build and effectively solve spam, this is just a form of spam. And eventually systems will be built and because they can be built in public will iterate pretty quickly to be like, this is a scamming collection. I'm just going to hide it from you in your interface. Like the token will be in your wallet but you're just never going to see it. And then people or collections that are serious or from trusted providers or that you've clicked in your address, folks that like Azuki airdropped to something today, certainly not what I want to see, some random thing. Maybe I'd let someone spam score it. And it can be community based ultimately spam scoring. You can see all the metrics if people use them and trade them and whatever. Thats pretty good collection. Let me surface it. Maybe youve actually gotten a nice nft here."

But lets assume youre a punks holder and Aku airdrop something, you need a verification that you havent verified. But whether its a large group because its distributed, we can pretty much solve that quite quickly by allowing the community to decide what is a verifiable thing and what isn't and then. So maybe that works."

That's why you see it as we get spam. But then we've solved it with filters. So two more big picture thesis. One, that is not, like, conceptually important, but it is, I think, important when we talk about nfts more specifically, I am pretty sure nfts are going to flip in fine art distribution. And one of the stories I told on Twitter. So I lived in Soho in Manhattan for 20 years, and it was always like an early in my life life dream to own an Andy Warhol tomato soup kit. And so when I was 22 in Manhattan and certainly did not have the money to pay that much for a print, I'd go to the museum and I'd take dates to the museum and we'd go look at them. Someday one of these will be mine, right? And then I got older, and then at some point I'm like, hmm, I think I have enough money to be able to do this. And I lived a block away from some of the top Warhol dealers on the planet. The process is hilariously bad, right? You go to them and say, hey, do you have an Andy Warhol tomato soup can? No. Okay. Do you know when you'll have one? Also? No. Will you call me when you have one? And they say, yes, but the guy there at the front desk is writing your name on a post it. And I'm like, oh, God, he's never going to call me. That post is going to be in the trash by tonight. And so this goes on for years. I'm popping every couple months."

Or they called some guy they wanted sold tomorrow, I don't know. Until finally I see one in the window and I said, okay, I want to buy this. And then how much is it? $140,000. Okay, why isn't this price? Because basically because we say so. Okay, fine. Here's me, like fairly naive art. How do I know it's an Andy Warhol? Here's his signature. I'm in crypto for years at this point. That doesn't mean anything. That's security theory. How do I know that's a signature? Well, we are going to give you this certificate that says. We say it's a signature. I'm like, you're printing it out right in front of me. It doesn't mean anything either. This was signed in the 1960s. You're printing out the certificate right in front of me today."

That's how I bought it. And I'm pretty sure I have a certain one of those tomato soup cans. As sure as anyone else who buys from the gallery, but I wouldn't say I'd bet my life on it. Okay. An interesting process. And then I compare it to when I second time around at the punks, when I said, I'm going to buy a punk, and then another punk and another punk and can't stop. But there. Did I have to go to West Broadway and Soho? No, I was in fact, several thousand miles away from there. In fact, I was locked down in Covid. In fact, I couldn't leave my sofa. But all that I need Internet connection and metamask. And how do I know it was the right price? Well, I had the global order book since inception in front of me. Every sale, every bid, every ask, every transfer, I can bid anyone I want, even if it's not for sale. I can see who has them. You have full transparency, and you're like, oh, I see. This is art distribution's Internet moment. It's going from being a pre Internet business to a post Internet business. And here someone in our world. No, no, but we have websites where we sell art. That's different. This is now natively Internet. The whole thing is. It's not. You have an order management system and then a different unit ships this out to you. Ive done that, too. Ive shipped art across continents. It takes months. Its painful. It costs a surprising amount of money. EBay did not turn out to be some type of subset of Pennsylvania antique shops. It turned out to be a gigantic superset of Pennsylvania antique shops. It was the global marketplace for non standard goods or something. And that's what's going to happen here. It's not that I am not saying fine art galleries are going to go away. I mean, there's antique shops in Pennsylvania today, there's radio stations today. But the market opportunity for selling art and then a bunch of other things which we'll talk about in a second online, is vastly larger than selling it through a subscale retail shop that, on average, on a Tuesday afternoon, 11:00 has zero people in. Zero. None. That is actually typically what it looks like. It's better for artists. Damien Hirst, did this drop last year. Damon Hearst, of course, are very famous artists. Damon Hearst can sell his art whenever he wants, but he sold 10,000 pieces in five minutes. And even if he had five galleries working for him at the same time, they couldnt sell at that volume, at that pace in the real world. Even if youre Damien Hurst."

You're going to do your own website to try and solve them. Try and get into one of our big art difficult here though and I'm not saying it's easy but you can Chris Dixon style find your 50 or 100 true fans, that there are probably 100 people in the world who would buy a one or two butterfly nFTs a year from your style and you can turn your hobby into your actual profession.

So I think it is like all democratizing technologies good for people who have less access previously and then they'll be like, oh well, it's not fair. They sell their NFts cheaper. How can you really say that? You're going to say people shouldn't have access to the same payment rails as the rest of the world in some parts of the world. Why shouldn't they have access? Why shouldn't they get access? So I think it's going to be, and when I say it's going to flip in it, it's going to take time. Fine art galleries with physical works will be here in 50 years, right? Nothing's going away, but there'll be vastly more growth and potential in this area. But I think here's where we get to the meat of it. Obviously the most important thing about NFTs is not that we can put art on them, right? NFts are going to go, in my view, like this. Today we're doing art and collectibles, but also some other things, like the bored ape yacht club for me doesn't slot into art or collectibles cleanly. It's also like some weird decentralized lifestyle franchise media codes, something like that, right? I keep thinking of its like a franchisee model except you dont have to go to McDonalds University in Illinois and spend six months getting approved to have a McDonalds franchise. If you want to do something cool with a certain ape and what have you, you just buy it and then you have the license to commercially exploit it. And here its one where theres still a gigantic failure of imagination. Sure some things have happened, right? Like someone made a microbrew with their board ape and someone made a band and someone made a coffee brand. None of these things are big yet, but this is just a complete failure of imagination because obviously whether it happens with a board ape or any other project of this type, obviously a model where you are not rate limited by the number of people you hire in your startup, but your rate limited by the world global community is one of them, is going to commercialize vastly better than eyeing to hire a marketing person and a business development person. How do you scale globally? You cant limit it. So its just because these projects are early. In three to five years we will see global brands that were built off NFT collections probably first in the PFB space and the basis of acceptable solutions there now not acceptable solutions. People can do whatever they want, but the basis of solutions that are going to work is either commercial rights to token holders or public domain CC zero and PFP collections. From the moment that Yuga bought the punks IP and took the punks to the bored ape commercial model because they are the last important holdouts, it's over. It is impossible that you can say I want to make a competitive PFP collection and you, the holder, can't do anything with it. That's done now. So the question is just, and it's a very interesting question, which will do better. People who are they have their own rights themselves or go all the way to the nouns, the oh, I won't say the word Mfers and so on, where anyone can do anything. So that's the basis of competition. So the board apes are in that type of web three ish type business, sort of. We don't know what to call it yet. I don't think we've seen the even a fraction of the models we'll see, but there'll be a class of things that are like that."

The visual arts haven't been culturally as important as music for decades now. Right? Think about how much day to day impact and, you know, throw a dart at some, some random person in the world. How much impact has contemporary art had on them versus music? Right? It's not really even that close to mouse like. It's. Whereas some of the prior visual arts movements did, I think, have a bigger impact, NFTs in their first stage have brought the visual arts roaring back. Nfts today are still primarily visual arts, it's primarily a visual field, but there's all types of super interesting things that can happen in music as well. And I think interesting hybridizations between on chain and off chain in music. And it's the whole coming back to making a direct connection with your collectors, fans community that it's hard to do it in a nice way through a database. It's just not the same. There's not that same. Being a database entry in someone who's sending me an email just does not feel the same as owning a PFP from that person's collection. Like, the aesthetic experience is completely different, right? The psychological experience is completely different. You feel much better in the second. Right? So. But where do we go from here? We're gonna go to gaming. We're probably two to three years away from like the next generation of games. I mean, there's a lot of stuff, you know what's not going to work is that every PFP collection of 10,000 nfts makes their own like half baked game.

Rugged with gaming roadmaps in the short term, but eventually the idea that you can and should own your in game assets and that the take rate of the gaming company should drop from 100% to 3% feels inevitable.

Nike probably can't make a competitive, can't make a competitive company to them here you can actually directly own the intangibles on a first class basis with anyone else. If we agree that, and agree it's just a social construction, if we start moving around intangibles on tokens in a permissionless system that everyone can access, that everyone can use the same rails, that Nike doesn't have a distribution bench, they might have a marketing advantage. That's different. The marketing advantage and the distribution advantage are different. Damien Hirst might have a marketing advantage to the butterfly photographer in Knoxville, but Damien Hirst does not have a distribution advantage. Previously he had a distribution advantage. He was in the gallery in the big cities and the butterfly photographer is not. Now they're on the same rails, ERC tokens with a variety of marketplaces and discoverability and blah blah. They have a marketing event, which is fine. There's always going to be marketing events. So now any person on the planet has access to the same meme transportation technology as the most powerful person on the planet. And generally the medium is the message, right? Things change when mediums change. There's a land grab of sorts, right? Because the medium is the message. The message changes with the medium. So the message is changing because the medium has changed dramatically. And so there's a period that's not an infinite period where you can set new cultural and societal standards. That period is now. In ten years, it's going to solidify, it's going to ossify, and then 20 years from now, there'll be something else. There's that process always of renewal. But a society with television is different than a society without television. A society with the Internet is different than a society without the Internet. It's not the same pre Internet society, but with Google and Facebook and Twitter. The society itself changes when you have Twitter, everything about how humans interact changes when you have Facebook and match and Tinder and Uber and Airbnb, it becomes a different society. And here society will change because we now have direct, first class access to memetic rails. It's a huge deal. It's an endlessly big deal. Even I. I feel I see just the faintest outlines of what it's going to be. But what I think is going to be is actually gigantic. Right? And I think there's an opportunity today in this field for people with all types of different skills, including for people with skills which historically might have not been valued in the technology industry. The technology industry has sucked up a huge amount of societal value in the last 20 years because it's been very useful and it has favored a certain type of person. The type of person who can found a Google is not hugely different from the type of person who can found a Twitter. Well, here we've made the rails accessible. There's a little bit of tech you need to learn, but not that much. And then whatever your skill set is, you can actually, whatever your culture, your orientation, the thing you want to get out, you have access to the same rails as everyone else. And it's a very big deal. And so my kind of fourth bucket or what have you here is societal intangibles will start moving around in on rails and everyone says, okay, this is all made up. You guys are just playing a game with yourselves. It's just a social construction. Of course it's just a social construction, but so is the title deep to your house, right? It's a social construction that if a piece of paper is in a certain office and it has your name on it, you then have the right to put a fence on this piece of land and shoot someone who comes on it. That paper is that paper. The land is just as off chain to that paper as anything else we're doing in nfTs. The reason that paper means something is a whole agreed system that that paper means something. And what has emerged emergently is that if you own this token from this smart contract, in fact, token 6529, we're all going to agree that you own punk 6529. It's no different than if we say, hey, you have this title deed for this house. We're all going to agree. And then use a whole enforcement mechanism of society to protect your house. It's equally made up. You don't think of it. Houses feel very, very tangible. But the fact that the state will enforce your right to live in your house because your name's on the piece of paper is just as much a social convention that I can say. I'm six five to nine because this token's in my ethereum wall. Now we found a social convention for moving on to tangents. Big deal. Deeply unexplored yet, okay, we've barely scratched the surface. And then I'm going to take one more step because this is where the part that's most important to me and that's quote unquote metaverse."

And so in ten years, you're going to have a pair of sunglasses on. I'm going to have a pair of sunglasses on. There'll be heads up displays. We'll be in augmented reality on a permanent basis. We'll press a button. You'll shop in front of me, I'll shop in front of you. We'll talk about bored apes. They'll float in front of us. We'll talk about skeuomorphic discoverability and some type of virtual art gallery will show up in front of us. Right? It's going to be this blended digital hybrid space that we're in permanently. It's all your current screen time, but plus all the rest of your waking hours that are not screen time, because those glasses are never leaving your head because they're going to be super useful and convenient. And arguably, it's better even for, like, your friends and family that you don't have a phone stick in your head. You can be looking ahead of you. And then if a notification comes, it comes. Right? So the one is the visualization. The other part, though, goes back to where we started. We now have composable cross application digital objects. They have left the databases of a bunch of companies. We have digital objects now, but my digital objects now x my NFTs are in the Twitter database, my tweets on Facebook. There's pictures of me doing things. Oh, look, it's me eating a dumpling. It's in Facebook's database. If I want access to another application, what do I have to do? Get an API key, make sure I follow the terms of service code, a custom integration with another application. This is pre Internet type stuff. This is like trying to run the Internet with content management, proprietary content management systems, NFT. We've now invented hyperlinking, we've invented HTML, we've invented a common platform that I can take 6529 and put him in a social network, or put him in a gallery, or put him in a game, or put him in a lending platform, or put in any one of the next thousand applications are going to come. And so this is where all the innovation will happen to. Like, all the innovation is going to happen because you have permissionless innovation, just like a programmable, permissionless money with bitcoin, right? You now have permissionless innovation and cultural digital objects. So you put those two things together, the metaverse is going to be epically compelling because this is the part where people say, oh no, I'm not going to wear those glasses. Just like you're not going to get a smartphone, just like you're not going to use Google and Twitter and Facebook and email and elevation. Come on. All this stuff is hugely convenient. It makes you more productive. It fires your dopamine receptors. You're always going to do it, right? So since we're inevitably going to live in the space, then the most important societal discussion that we are not having is, since this world is coming, how should it be architected? And right now, there are only two choices. The ones we said at the beginning of the conversation. It can be those digital objects and your position. Those digital objects can be in a database, which roasted means a company's database, because I don't think the government is going to do the metaverse platforms or it can be in a blockchain. There is no third thing we've invented. These are your two choices. And so if you think nfts are not the way, then I ask you, tell me which company should own this. And my view is no company should own this because it is problematic, and it's problematic in the classic web, one web, two scenarios."

Facebook could be a huge force for decentralization if they supported decentralized digital objects natively on first class basis. Yeah, I agree that so far is blah blah. What is actually a released product is integrated ecosystem. And it's integrated ecosystem from the software platform to the hardware platform. And it's a bet the company integrated ecosystem as of today, when that changes, my view will change. I look at what people ship, not what they tell us. Web one had the right architecture, came out of academia, that's why. Right? Like they didn't think to monetize. So email is SMTP, which means it's an interoperable standard, which means if you like Gmail, you can use Gmail. If you like Outlook, you can use Outlook. If you don't like any of these things, you can run your own email server. Short messaging online turns out to be Twitter. And that has all types of weird outcomes, right? One thing that like, was, I think, a wake up call for a lot of governments around the world. It doesn't matter if you like Jack Dorsey or don't like Jack Dorsey. It doesn't matter if you like Donald Trump or don't like Donald Trump. This is completely relevant to what I'm about to say. It is deeply weird that for some strange reason, Jack Dorsey was one of the most important people who had to have an opinion on if there was a coup happening in the United States. Because Jack Dorsey is a talented Texas executive, but he's a random CEO of a random tech company. Why on earth would that be his decision? It's like saying we need to decide on, I don't know, our policy for national defense, and we're going to ask the CEO of Procter and Gamble. We have courts, we have elected representatives, we have police, we have all of these systems of democratic governance. And in no model of democratic governance would you assume that the person who can wipe you off the Internet should be the CEO of one or two random tech companies, and they were all within their rights. The First Amendment does not apply to private companies. The problem isn't that Twitter doesn't want Donald Trump on their servers. It's perfectly fine. They might not want it. That's a business decision. The problem is once you're not on Twitter servers, you are cut off from global short messaging. Whereas once you're Donald Trump, I don't know if he's been knocked off of people's posted emails, but he clearly can send emails because worst case scenario, he can have server. And the problem is, oh, but I don't like Donald Trump. They did the right thing. But the problem is they have to make this decision. For 8 billion people on the planet, it is impossible decision. The russian foreign ministry has a Twitter account. Are they more or less appropriate to have Twitter account? I have no idea. It's not like they can. It's impossible to make these decisions correctly. The answer, I mean, imagine it the other way. Imagine if we said, no, no, no. We need to have a CEO of email, and that CEO needs to be a public company CEO with all the obligations and risks and shareholder pressures of a CEO. And that CEO has to decide if every single person on the planet CEO. It's obviously ridiculous. And yet that's what short messaging is and it's what medium messaging is. Medium messaging is Facebook. And so project out now ten years. This metaverse isn't like Twitter. Isn't like Facebook. It's infinity times better. It's photorealistic. It's all around you. It's augmented. It has all these great features. If you can get kicked out of that space, it's like you're going to be cast into the darkness."

I keep saying the end state is augmented reality. I think it is. Right? But why does augmented real, how does augmented reality work? Augmented reality works because you have a camera looking into your field of vision, right? So imagine you have a family, you have kids. Would you think to yourself, it would make a lot of sense for some tech company to have God's eye view of everything your son or daughter is seeing for the next 20 years? Even if they told you, no, don't worry, I'll be encrypted. We definitely won't use it inappropriately.

I'm sure your privacy policies are fine. It's five to nine. And you certainly won't do anything inappropriate with having constant video surveillance of my life, right?

If you have global God's eye view of everyone on the planet on everything they're doing, the NSA is going to shut up to your door. And if it's not the NSA, it's someone else. The state will not be able to tolerate a company being vastly more powerful than the state infrastructure. And so the very weird thing, we know that China is building some type of social credit system of this other. There's all types of presentations of it. And you read things in the media. Not exactly. Right. But broadly it's. Right. Like, broadly, the idea that, like, oh, look, we weren't too thrilled with what you've been doing recently. Back to the second class trade, etcetera, etcetera, right? And we say, oh, I can't believe the Chinese are doing that. That's for me. We're building the same system. We're just building it by mistake and we're building it across all dimensions. We talked about the vat of versa visualization part, but we are progressively centralizing everywhere. Take a simple example, a taxi ride in New York 25 years ago. If you wanted to block me from taking a taxi, right, in New York, effectively you have to arrest it. Okay, how are you going to block. You hail a taxi, you take some cash out of your pocket. Take me to 52nd street. Okay. You have to arrest me to stop it. How do you stop today? We're not all the way there, but mostly there. If you just flip a switch on Uber and Lyft because you don't like me, I can't hail attacks now. There's still some yellow cabs. But I noticed the other day that Uber is now going to be also integrating yellow caps. The yellow cabs have their own app. Another three to four years, all taxi's are going to be electronically intermediated by like three or four companies. And then inevitably someone's going to be socially undesirable and blah, blah, blah, blah, and you violate the terms of service. And yeah, we don't want that type of person uber because we have liability. What if he punches a taxi driver? What if he punches a super driver? We don't like him. Right. And then you'll be able, with a flip of a switch to ban someone from taxis in New York, which sure sounds like the types of things that we say. Oh, that's very bad. Happening in China. The other dimension of this, cBDCs. CBDCs are very interesting. Should there be national sovereign currencies? True stable coins available online? Yeah, I think that's interesting. But what's less interesting, the less interesting part is this. If you look at what the BIS says, what the ACB says, it's a little bit more mixed in the US and the Fed is a little bit more mixed. There's voices in both directions, but, oh, it's great. We'll be able to, I don't know, effectively end crime because we can censor any undesirable transaction."

It's hard to prevent people from transacting in cash. It's a very intensive process to get every transaction under control. Once you move everyone to a centralized permission CBDC, then you just run machine learning algorithms, you run big data algorithms, and you have what I worry about. And it's interesting because I've been worried about this for years, and all my in real life friends randomly are subjected to these rants at dinners and stuff. And they start with like, it's weird. We're like setting up. I think it's mostly accidental. It's partially, you know, it's partially the us surveillance infrastructure, financial surveillance infrastructure, but also partially accidental. We're bit by bit setting up the fall. A global sensible digital money system, a oligopolistic services infrastructure, cars, Airbnbs, et cetera, et cetera. Now, the digital space in which we're going to live all the time in ten years, the metaverse, let's say all of these end up in 1015 entities.

We're going to freeze everyone's accounts and starve them out of the square infrastructure for these things. I'm not saying these things aren't annoying. I'm sure they're annoying. I'm not even saying that I suspect I don't have very much in common with the guys that were causing all these issues. I suspect if I lived there, I'd find them immensely annoying. But the reality is, if you set the precedent that for something that I'm pretty sure was not the type of national emergency that Canada was going to fall, right. I don't think they were going to. Canada has a pretty serious army. Canada was not about to fall. If that means you can, without due process, freeze the money of anyone who's even sent them money for a sandwich. That is the model of which the next attack is going to happen. That's a small trial run over the most implausible place of all. And I don't even think Justin is planning something crazy. I think he got caught in the top spot and it was politically expedient to solve it this way instead of sending police and having fights in the street and people getting hurt and then being. But the reason he could do it is because the infrastructure is mostly centralized. Today it's mostly centralized and were heading for it to be 100% centralized. And once its there, the temptation to use it is high. Right. When even Justin Trudeau uses this, well, I mean, come on. Hes no future totalitarian dictator. Hes a fairly normal politician, but he was in a tight spot. The infrastructure was there. He used it. Someone else will use. The lines will erode. And there is probably, I think, the most popular treat storm like you don't actually have any constitutional rights in practice. If someone can just freeze your money, how do you.

And I mean, it's clear that they haven't. Right. Like what's the counter evidence that they have? And it's a UX problem, but it's a UX problem more broadly to fund. It's fun to play with your nfts.

I mean, I'm quite technically experienced. I once at some point had to move the 6529 museum nfts from a treasure to hypnosis, multisig. This is not, I need to step up my security and I had to move like 1000 nfts or something, including some of the most iconic nfts in the world.

That was the whole, I'm like, oh, God, I, I'm just going to screw up epically. The UX sucks. I have spent quite a bit of time behind the scenes, constructively sharing suggestions, let's say, with all the big infrastructure providers of the space. I have some sympathy for them because the space is 100 x. In the last year and a half, they're scrambling around just to make sure the lights stay on. But they need to hire every UX person on the planet and there needs to be a shift like there was with the auto industry when the auto industry shifted gears from saying accidents or user error to accidents and deaths are our fault. Okay, every time I see, and this is like every week someone has accidentally sent their board ape to some scam contract. My takeaway is different than the majority of Twitter is like oh there you go, the board ape idiots again, handing over their viable nfts. Right? No, that should be treated like a six sigma quality failure for the industry. Yes, it's obviously knowable by software which contracts are real bored apes contracts. Right? Like it's trivially. No, you should flag it at the software level. Right? There should be 27 warnings. Don't do this. Like the last three people who did this were underneath their bed in the puddle of tears afterwards. Are you still sure you want to do this? I mean that's how it should be. And because if we don't get this right we will end up on centralized systems because it's not societally acceptable or reasonable that someone makes a fairly innocent mistake in the scheme of things and loses a million dollars. It can't be that way. So the UX has to get much, much better. The industry has to work together, they should set common standards, they should use the same graphics, they should think about I mean things that happened and im not blaming anyone because its just, its a super challenge. But like Metamask and Trezor and Opensea at some point did upgrades at a different time and broke the whole infrastructure between themselves. No one was doing anything wrong but these things have to interoperate. So there needs to be a significant upgrading and investment of time, energy, UX on safety and usability because it's not ready for mass market. Mass market's coming and it's not ready for mass market. So we're just going to have people blowing themselves up and it's a shame and it's sad. And a world where the scammers win is not like any type of societal victory that's a failure state. Of course people should spend time in education. If I told you I'm giving you keys to my cardinal and no, you don't have to take driving lessons and you don't have to read the driver's manual and you don't have to pass a driving test. Well you crashed a car law right? I mean so there needs to be some awareness by people of like you should learn the basics but it's primarily an industry problem to solve. I think now we have another risk factor though that it's the most frustrating of all is that government is working against us, not with us, theoretically. And it's funny, I think about this primarily in the US and Europe, because, quite frankly, China's not going to be on our side on this. I don't think Russia is going to be on our side on this. The people who might think it's important that we have constitutional rights on transactions are going to be the major economies. Okay, well, where does everyone stand? The European Union, they lost web two epically to the Americans. Right? They are digital vassals to the Americans. They have all these conferences on how do we recover our national sovereignty and social networking and search, and they come up with these ideas that, of course, are never going to work. Like France is going to make its own search engine. None of this is going to work. Right. And sitting right in front of them for the last decade is the answer, because the most powerful thing the EU could do to reduce the power of the american tech, oligopolies, is web three."

If you give them their fees back. Oh, you're violating their rights somehow. Anyway, this is what it is. Europe doesn't have this. So Europe has this wide open opportunity to catch up, and they're in the process of fumbling. I don't know if you saw the news today, it moved out of committee. They are one step away from banning wallet. They're one step away from saying, yes, the future of crypto in Europe is you're going to hold your crypto in a subsidiary of Deutsche bank and associate general. Yeah, that's how web three is going to happen. EU is fumbling. The US, okay, definitely has much more infrastructure and a much more developed sector, but there has yet to be a party to just grab this by the horse and run with us. Trump was pretty deeply anti crypto. There's suspicion of crypto on the democratic side, even though arguably for the same reasons as the EU is favorable to him. Right. Like, it breaks up big corporations. But there's suspicion. And so there hasn't been an advocate in, a true advocate for, you know, if we had taken the same attitude in the mid nineties with the Internet, the us Internet would have not become the powerhouse it became. The us Internet was given some structural benefits. You don't have to collect sales taxes or we're going to treat e signatures real or section 230, it needs these to develop. And it turned out to be the greatest productivity machine over the last 50 years. And here not only were not getting these types of supportive measures, the whole crypto industry is trying to fight to just keep from going backwards. That thing that passed the infrastructure bill, and I forget offhand the name, it's section 50, blah, blah, blah, blah. If it's not changed, basically kills Defi in two years and is going to put a pretty, it would be fairly painful for nfTs, too, because since you have to report within ten days your counterparty for more than $10,000 or three eth, right, full KYC information, otherwise you're committing a felony. Well, in defi, it's just impossible because it's a liquidity pool. You don't know who your counterparty is. If that stays, Defi is dead for us citizens because you'll be committing felonies after felonies after felonies every time you go to uniswap, which is bizarre, I understand kind of the thought process, but it's pretty overkill, right? And then the other thing on NFTs, there at least you have a single individual counterparty. What it's going to mean that I think is inevitable, the big marketplaces are going to end up KYc'dan, because obviously if Im buying a bored ape on OpenSea, Im not going to be able to be like, hey, guy, can you give me your drivers license so I can fill out this form to send it to the treasury to tell them I sent you ade? Opencs going to have to do it. So for Opencs going to have to do it, theyre going to have to kyc you."

If you let them defend themselves, maybe sometimes someone who was actually guilty gets away with it because the state was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that committed the crime. Right.

As far as an MVP is concerned, generally sophisticated, but for an MVP, off the charts.

Like, I remember when Twitter was having the discussion, like I am now just old enough to see patterns. Remember when Twitter was having the discussion because Fred Wilson was blogging about it? I think not. Jack knows Fred, should it become a protocol or a service? And at the time it seemed like a normal startup business decision. The decision made was totally sensible. It's the safe choice. And Twitter back then was basically where tech rose in San Francisco, said, I'm going out to lunch. Who cares really if it's protocol or service? And you fast forward to today and suddenly it's the arbitrary of global geopolitics somehow. But now it's too late. It's a public company, it has shareholders, what have you. It's very interesting. What could Jack even possibly do now? Nothing. It's too late, right? That ship has sailed. And so we're at that phase now. And this is, this is the part I spent all day, night thinking about.

It's a decentralized system and rich people are pretty good. If we think nfts may be an exciting business opportunity to go up in value, rich people are going to succeed one way or another. Then the questions are, well how is it going to happen? By default it'll be like some trad five people or some ex Goldman Sachs people or whatever and they'll do a fund and it will start with those values. First issue is, well I'd rather have it run by all pure NFT natives, the whole team. There is all these superstar NFT natives like Bharat and Bsy and Han and AC. So culturally they'll be more in tune. And then what? My not very secret plan is because I tweeted it and I told it to LP's, I'm hoping in time we solve some of the securities law stuff and theres some way you can tokenize the collection time and then keep it in a decentralized space.

Im now just mansplain for the last half an hour and a half on why decentralization is so important. If im then like cool lets sell this to Mark Zuckerberg. I dont know, just embarrassing. Like it'll be embarrassing right? So I'm saying this should stay in decentralized spaces. I control it, I can make that decision and it's going to stay there. And then my not very secret plan, again I tweeted it is to get a whole bunch of other institutions. I bought a bunch of nfts and I'm fortunate enough to buy a lot. And then I ran out of money and I got some of my friends to give me some money with the exciting proposition of they said oh what are you going to do? We're going to buy nfts. Oh, that's great. Then later we're going to sell them for more money. I said, no, no, no, we're not going to do that. They said, oh, are we going to sell all the NFTs together?

An eth by tomorrow would be really great. Just, well, is there a company, like, just send it. You see this, this address? Just send your eth here. And what are we going to do? Well, I don't know. I'll set up a company, something we're just right now I need to eat because I got to buy this jPeg. Because you know, last summer I think as a collector I broke out of the Sian generative art.

And then convince companies and artists and sports teams and universities to issue nfts, not like some other goofy thing. And then bring capital providers on board, but try and find a solution to keep them on the decentralized side. Keep them on the. That it's important to them and maybe their future generations that maybe the world does not become an oligopoly run by ten firms. I don't think that's a good outcome. I should say this, I have no problem with any of the tech firms. They've done a wonderful job, they're incredible businesses. And what I would highly encourage them, they could change the course of history and solve this in an instant by themselves, committing to open standards.

The other one that I've looked at that I thought is maybe the easy way is NFT ticketing. Yes, it's a good one because everybody understands the idea of having a ticket on your phone. And if all you have to do is make some easy wallet that if you come to this concert by whoever it is, you have to download this and do that. Most music fans will do that. They will do a little bit of pain to have the unique experience of owning that NFT. That could be millions and it can happen pretty quick. So that's just another attack vector for you."

The galleries have this completely fragmented, subscale, semi pointless order book, right? And then you have a global order book. The hotels have these subscale fragments, and I don't know how many hotels in the world. Tons, right? The order book is spread across hundreds of thousands of hotel databases. Right? And you could make it public. And then you say, I can see the global reserve price for a night in Barcelona at any type of hotel, on any type of floor at any night. All the inventory. Right?

It was all of these, everybody together in one place. Paul McCartney. So I went to buy tickets for it because I thought, well, you never see all these people together. And it was the great baby boomer event I thought I should attend just to see the whole spectacle. So I tried to buy tickets and on Stubhub, you have your eyeballs ripped out. Ticket prices were trading with bid offer spreads of $2,000. And what it was basically was the high frequency market makers in the middle of that, taking these massive spreads, and you were not having a full market clearing event because there was basically an oligopoly of who was allowed to make prices. It was abusive. And that whole system, if it was done in this different way, when youve got liquidity providers, liquidity pools, and amm, before you know it, youve really created an efficient market. The one ive been looking into is time. Many people ask me for some of my time or you for some of your time, and there are ways that you could tokenize that time. So therefore, the market bids for that time, and you can decide whether you want to release that time. There are inefficient ways of doing that, but there are efficient ways as well where you can actually clear market time for people. And it actually becomes a way of organizing corporations. So at a corporation, the higher up you are, the more time demands that you have. But also, you can also be somebody who's a really in demand because you're doing too many projects at once and you're good at your job, and you've got all of these people wanting your time. If you're time traded freely within the corporation, you allocate resources effectively and you prioritize. There's some really interesting stuff around all of this."

There's no the edges of the corporation and the edges of the corporation. Consumers operate in a capitalist economy, but the internal operations of any large organization have no price signals. None or very, very gross. Once a year. Let's do your performance review. You try and convince me that you're better than the other person at your level, and they'll give you $2,000 a year raise or something. There's no markets, right? And this is, I have a good friend from the first go around in crypto Twitter who I'm not going to docs, but this is very well known. And about a month after I booted up 6529, he dm'd 6529 not minds me and saying, hey, I'm really interested in these things you're saying for dinner. I was laughing. I'm like, that's enough. A call. And he's like, wait, it's you. No way. That's incredible. But it's very funny. Within, like, a few months, all my other account friends followed me, started dming me. It's interesting, right? I hope that was interesting. But anyway, what I started saying is NFTs are obviously trivially going to be vastly bigger than fungible tokens. They're going to be vastly bigger because on the one hand, they're the way you can represent arbitrarily the metaverse. Also they're the way once you have bridges to the off chain world, they can represent all assets in the world. And the world in general is non fungible. The only thing that is fungible in the world, financial instruments, everything else, is non fungible. And now we have a model to represent the world at large in a digital way. Composable ownership, transportation, financialization, all these things. Well, it's trivially the case that they're going to be bigger than fungible tokens, and today they're like 2% the market cap of fungible tokens. Come on, this is ridiculous. This is the single biggest mispricing in financial markets in the world. Right?"

And the reality is, most versions of go buy something anything end in disaster. Ive told so many people since 2013 buy bitcoin, and a lot didnt. But even the ones that did somehow manage to lose money on it, which is incredible. My advice on the buying side tends to be very conservative relative to anyone on look, you should put an amount. I tell people if they want fungible tokens, buy the major ones in small quantities. Over time, assume your nfts you're going to buy are going to go to zero. Most nfts are not going to be a good financial investment. For someone who's not deeply into the NFT space, buying nfts as a way to fund your retirement is likely to end in tears. Also, and for normal people who are not used to the volatility of crypto, the best thing they can do is allocate a small amount of their net worth to it and allocate it and assume it's gone to zero. And when they look at me shocked, they say, okay, whatever number you had in mind was too much, just drop the number because otherwise whats going to happen the next time nuke 75% are going to sell and its definitely going to nuke 75%. Nfts in particular feel like altcoins. In 2013 I spent a year and a half in nfts. I look at bitcoin, ethereum now, they look like a treasury bond. Theyre so stable. The best thing people can do is educate themselves because the number of career opportunities in the space are going to be infinity. And whatever level you are in your career, your junior, your mid, your senior, you're an entrepreneur, you're a lawyer, you're accountant, you're a graphic designer, almost certainly your career path, your opportunities, your income stream. By orienting to this space, you're going to be better. And along the way, if you start doing things, you will get smarter about the space naturally, and then you'll make better decisions. You can't short circuit the fact that even, I mean, I consider myself quite sophisticated in crypto and half the time I wonder if I know what I'm doing. I've spent thousands of hours. And so the idea that there's some type of free lunch that you can tell someone, go, the only free lunch I would say is probably dollar cost averaging into bitcoin, ethereum, something else, and buy nfts for fun, that's probably close to free lunch, but over long periods of time and with huge drawdowns and whatever, so there's no free lunch of that type of thing. What is, though, a great idea is spend time on it because the single biggest, and this has always been the problem with crypto, it's been the problem for eight years. Problem. Today the ideas are there. We're short of people. And so if you are, I don't know, a bookkeeper, but you know how to read Etherscan, your hourly billing rate is going to triple."

Okay, do a little bit, spend a few hours on build up, supplement your current income at first, and then as you get into the space, then maybe one day the opportunity will come. Whether it's whether your life orientation is you want a job or your life orientation is your entrepreneur, you want to start a business. If you spend time in this rapidly expanding space, eventually you're going to see something that is likely a better expected value for your life than being in an industry that's growing at 5% a year. I've worked in industries of all types. There's nothing more painful than working in an industry that's slowly shrinking. You work just as hard as everything else, maybe harder, and you just can't win. It's just this dog fight with your competitors on who can grab the traps, and it's just painful. There's nothing fun about it. And so the economy does give us these price signals and they say, look, we apply your resources over, apply your labor over here. I think thats interesting."
