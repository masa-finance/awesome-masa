        "text": "Hello and welcome back. Here's why you need to watch today's episode. First, we're going to discuss the fallout from the Solana exploit. It's continuing. Solana developers are claiming that the open source slope, closed source slope wallet may be to blame. I know we've seen issues with the Solana blockchain before, and if you're asking yourself, is this another problem with the blockchain? Should I be concerned about my Solana? Rest assured that this is a wallet issue. An application built on top of the blockchain. The blockchain is currently operating as usual. We're also going to have our monthly check in with Rekt capital. He's back to share his good old fashioned technical analysis. As everyone continues to ask, have we found the bottom? We're going to hear exactly what rect has to say. This is your real vision. Crypto daily briefing. My name is Mark Oliveira, and with me today, we have, as always, Ash Bennington. Let's kick things off and talk about the latest price action. So, despite yesterday's exploit of Solana, Solana seems to be trading sideways, up roughly half a percent over the last 24 hours. That seems to be the name of the game today for the top ten coins. Bitcoin has barely moved in the last 24 hours, up roughly 0.12%. Ethereum basically finds itself in the same boat. Despite the growing enthusiasm for the upcoming merge, Ethereum is down just 0.19% this morning. And then here are the top stories we're going to cover today. So, the first story we're going to cover, the Solana hack and what we know. So, with the dust starting to clear from this Solana exploit, we have a better idea of what happened and why. Ash, tell me, what have we learned in the past 24 hours?"

        "text": "Well, what we've learned in the past 24 hours is that exactly as you said, this is an external wallet, a hot wallet for the Solana blockchain where the flaw was. What we've also learned is that there's a great deal of strum and drawing about the exact nature of the cause, how precisely the security flaw worked was implemented by the exploit. I think what we've learned in the broader sense, as we continue to reinforce this, what we are talking about here is software. Cryptocurrencies are software with all the attendant complexities that come with troubleshooting software. So it's going to take some time before we get to the bottom of existing exactly what went wrong here. Lots of theories flying around on Twitter, lots of folks close to the projects weighing in. But in terms of a definitive outcome, a definitive cause, we don't have it yet."

I think that all of these types of, the cumulative sum of all the challenges that we see in terms of software flaws begins to add up. I was asked yesterday about, is it surprising that there are exploits happening? And I said, it's like being surprised that your pet tiger bites you. This is still a very early stage. Industry software is inherently incredibly complex. Coordinating development between open source projects and closed source projects is a non trivial task. We're going to have to continue to work through these issues as these platforms mature, but don't look for these types of exploits to disappear anytime soon. Marca."

        "text": "Yeah, this is about bridges. Bridges have been something that we've been talking about as a potential security issue on real vision now for many months. I read a quote yesterday from Corby Pryor, who's been on real vision before, talking about precisely these kind of issues. You know, Corby's take on this, and one that I think has been borne out in terms of the actual results that we've seen, is that unless you have consensus mechanisms securing the underlying validity of a blockchain, it is very difficult to have these cross platform software bridges conduct these operations where you're transferring between chains with security. You know, you look at this chart, pretty obvious here. I think the number that you cited there, about $2 billion in total value lost from bridge attacks. This is considerable. This is material. Again, this is a challenge that's probably here to stay for some time. Marco?"

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, the short answer is, excuse me, that microstrategy has increased about 66%. We've seen some pretty dramatic upswings in the stock here over the last one month. This is. This is sort of like I was joking around earlier this morning. This is kind of like, you know, when you're in a relationship, it's really new. And like, no matter what happens, the other thing, the thing that the other person does is like, super cute. That's kind of the way that bull markets work. News gets interpreted in the most positive way. And of course, the converse is true and bear markets. So what we've seen here in terms of the messaging coming out of microstrategy is this notion that Michael Saylor is going to be moving from his CEO role to an executive chairman role. By the way, this is relatively common at companies where you've seen CEO's in place for decades. They often take a move into the executive chair role so that they can be freed up from some of the day to day responsibilities to handle some more strategic thinking for the company. In this particular case, microstrategy. Excuse me. Microstrategy has cited the explicit objective of Michael Saylor having more time to focus on bitcoin and bitcoin acquisition. The market seems to like that interpretation. Again, this has been a little bit of a relief rally as we've seen across crypto from the lows. So the sentiment is just broadly positive. And it seems like everything is catching a bid on any news that comes out when you tell the story in a way that's consistent with that broader narrative. Marco."

So really funny story. On a different note, pivoting breaking story. BlackRock and Coinbase partnership Blackrock and Coinbase have announced the partnership mutual customers of both platforms are going to have access to crypto trading through this management platform. Aladdin Coin shares up significantly today, and there's even reports on Twitter that Robinhood is halting trading due to volatility. This is, of course, a developing story. Ash, what are your thoughts on this?"

        "text": "Well, it's interesting. It's a story that gives a certain layer of credibility to the whole broader digital asset space that BlackRock is getting into it. Blackrock, of course, the world's largest private asset manager. I think about $10 trillion in AUM, obviously a massive number. And it's hard to see this as anything other than a kind of broader acceptance of the digital asset crypto space by mainstream Wall street. It doesn't get any bigger than Blackrock, I should say. If you cover financial services, as I do, the folks from Blackrock, whenever I run into them at a party or a bar, and you try and get information out of them, they're notoriously tight lipped around the cryptocurrency story and what they're doing in that space. So this really is kind of a major stamp of approval, I would say, for digital assets from mainstream Wall street."

        "text": "Amazing. Well, so on the notes of prices increasing in these two stocks, that brings us to our first clip of the day. I sat down with technical analyst rec capital. He's the author of the Rec Capital newsletter, and it was really great to get his analysis on bitcoin. The thing I like about Rec a lot is that he has this very down to earth, simple to understand commentary, and that makes him really unique in the space of technical analysts. And in this first clip, we discussed the 200 week moving average. And this is important for viewers because right now we're trading right on that, sideways, right on that line, on that moving average. Many traders are waiting to see what's going to happen next. Let's take a listen to what Rek has to say. And I want to kick things off talking about this current retest of the 200 week moving average that we have here. What's going on with this chart? Rekt?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, the 200 week moving average, this blue line here, that used to be historically a bottoming signal for bitcoins price action. For the first time, really, we're seeing an extended period of time where bitcoin was really consolidating below that 200 week moving average. And recently, only last week, bitcoin was able to close, weekly candle close above the 200 week moving average for the first time since March 2020. Really? So now bitcoin is pulling back, it is dipping, trying to secure that retest to turn this old resistance into a new support and in an effort to really just springboard towards higher levels. But at the moment, this retest is quite key. But it doesn't necessarily have to be successful because we're seeing loads of different trends going on right now in this market cycle relative to this 200 week moving average. Previously, we just see downside wicking, for instance, below the moving average before really quickly recovering back above it. In this market cycle, we're actually seeing a lot of consolidation. And now this retest, of course, just like in March 2020, that retest was successful. But this retest right over here, we have to be open to the fact that it might not be successful. And we could still see a drop into the 20k, even sub 20k region, because this is still technically a bottoming out process for bitcoin."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So let's say that it does successfully retest this 200 week moving average. Where could we see the next level of resistance at? Where would the price do you think could go if that scenario played out?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "That's a good question, because bitcoin enjoyed, or at least experienced a strong, sharp continuation in the downtrend when it lost the 28 key region. And a few months ago, bitcoin was still occupying the macro range, where bitcoin was just consolidating for a few months, bouncing from 28k, rallying towards the mid sixties before dropping back down again. So that was a macro range. And if bitcoin were to successfully retest this 200 week moving average as a support, the underside of that macro range would likely be a major resistance because that was once a major support. And at the same time, we don't have many higher timeframe resistances on the way to that twenty eight k, thirty k region. So if we do indeed rebound and continue from here in what may be a relief rally from bitcoin, then there isn't much resistance to resist that move towards that low, that range, low of the macro range. So twenty eight k to thirty k."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, Marco. It's the average price over a nearly four year period, 3.8 years. It's a very long term, slow moving average. Longer term moving averages are helpful for getting a very long term view of the overall trajectory of price movement. And it's interesting to note in Rex view, this was a historic bottoming signal. It closed above it for the first time since March of 2020. Rect is also talking about 20,000 being a potential resistance level in terms of his view of the technicals on this, in addition to the moving average. So that's his view of this. And it's an interesting one because he really does frame this. I think you mentioned this at the top of the show in a very big picture kind of way. And I think the clip that we just saw there speaks to exactly that point. Marko?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, definitely. And I think something else that really struck me about this clip is that the first time, this is the first time that he was saying that we got multiple candle closes below this 200 week moving average. In other parts of the interview, he was talking about. Normally we just wick below it really quickly and then recover pretty fast in a kind of a v shape type of way. And that already kind of has some implications, right? I mean, it kind of shows that this bear cycle is definitely different than the previous ones, but who knows how significant that is? Does it mean it's going to be a longer bear cycle or lower prices? Only time is going to tell us the significance of this, but I definitely think it's something to keep an eye on. So with that said, let's turn our attention to the next clip where rec discusses why he believes bitcoin's price below 35k is a bargain. I've also seen you tweet that anything sub 35k is a good buying opportunity. Can you explain that a little bit?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, absolutely. Data science suggests to us that the point of maximum financial opportunity generational bottoming is below 35,000. And this is an indicator that I referred to in the Rex Capital newsletter, and it was just the 200 year moving average, or rather the two year moving average. Apologies. And those are essentially two moving averages. One with one of those, we see downside deviation below them to form a bottoming out process for bitcoin in the bear market. And then we see a deviation beyond the higher moving average, which is actually a multiplier of that initial moving average. And that's where we see sharp, upside down, v shaped reversals at peaks where we see a peak in the bull market. So essentially, the moving average that concerns us the most at this point in time in the cycle is the bear market bottom one. So that's the two year moving average, and dropping below that two year moving average has historically preceded bear market bottoms, but we tend to see price drop down quite significantly below the two year moving average. So the two year moving average at this point in time represents the price point of 35,000. So essentially, if bitcoin is forming a bottoming out process in the bear market, starting from 35,000 all the way down to x, wherever that absolute bottom will be, then bitcoin has been in a bottoming out process, according to this data science model since 35k. So buying at 35k is still very much the range high of this macro range of this bottoming out process. So the lower price goes, the closer we get to the absolute bottom. But data science is suggesting that anything below 35k is already the bottoming out process."

        "text": "Now, Ash, the viewers, the real vision community, they have dubbed you as aggressively aggressively neutral. Mister aggressively neutral. With that in mind, tell me, what are your thoughts on this clip?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, again, this isn't my view. This is Rex view. But Rex sees anything on bitcoin below 35,000 as a buying opportunity. It's interesting to listen to him describe it because it's a very long term view, which is, and by the way, we should say that's obviously considerably above the current price. That's obviously bullish based on the price levels. I don't have a view on price one way or the other, especially in the short term. But it's really interesting to hear the way rect unpacks it because often you said this at the top of the show, Marco, often there's a lot of noise in the views or the feedback. When you listen to technical analysts with rect, you know exactly where he stands. He doesn't mince words and he gives you this big 50,000 foot view based on a longer term structural view of the price of bitcoin. And frankly, I just find that a very interesting way to look at bitcoin price. Mark?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, Ash, I think it's really important that you pointed out that this is a long term view, and he's not mincing words. He's being very direct about his approach. And his strategy is geared towards a long term view rather than short term trades. And before people start applying this strategy, they have to take that into consideration that he has a really long term view of, of bitcoin. Well, moving on to the next clip. So this is where rect is talking about the 20 month moving average. A lot of people want to know just how long can this crypto bear market, this crypto winter could last. Let's hear what rec has to say about this bottoming cycle."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I also want to focus on the amount of monthly candles that we see below the 20 month moving average. When we see that breakdown from that moving average in 2014, we saw 1234 monthly candles form before that bottom was found. Before that capitulation downside, Wick was had to just finish up that 63% retracement in the 2018 2019, the 2018 phase. It took one, two monthly candles to form before that final generational bottom was formed after a -52% retracement below the 20 month moving average. Right now in this cycle, we've seen one, two, three, and now this is the fourth candle that's currently forming. It's just August turned right now, but we've seen only three monthly candles form below the 20 month moving average. And just by looking at the amount of candles, or at least how long it should take. History is suggesting to us that it takes two to four months to find a bottom, and bitcoin is in its third month, it's fourth month. So still in the balance. Still technically, we could still find and look for that bottom going forward. But nonetheless, after that bottom forms, we can see that it takes a long time for that bottoming out process to form. So maybe the absolute bottom might be in, but the bottoming out process and that multi month consolidation lasts a fair amount. And the final confirmation for long term investors is to watch out for a break back beyond the 20 month moving average, because that would be evidence that a new macro uptrend and bull market is upon us."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Very interesting. I think that's an important distinction that you just made there, because you said that perhaps the bottom is already in, but the bottoming out process can take longer. Just to reiterate what you're saying, we're about three months into this bottoming out process, and it looks like they're anywhere from six to 13 bars, which means months that before we can see a potential or the full bottom, before we start going towards the uptrend, the wave starts moving or the tide starts shifting in the opposite direction."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, exactly. So if we just think about periods below the 20 month moving average, we see downtrend acceleration. So those two to four months of just capitulating, trying to find that absolute bear market bottom, and then we see multiple months of just sideways accumulation, trying to just solidify an accumulation range before, you know, just in preparation for breaking out from that sideways range and effectively challenging that 20 month moving average to confirm a new macro uptrend. Because theoretically, anything below the 20 month moving average could be whatever. It could be relief, it could be a bottoming out process. But once that moving average is broken, that's when the bullish sentiment is taking over and we're seeing a total shift in market trends. So going forward, definitely, we are in a period where perhaps the downtrend acceleration has paused for the moment. There is still scope for some final acceleration, that final capitulation for new lows. We could still see that absolute bottom, but it shouldn't detract us from the fact that this is a bottoming out process, and this bottoming out process will take multiple months and occur within a relatively wide range. Like I mentioned earlier, and you alluded to Marco with the data science model, anything below 35,000 is the beginning of the bottoming out process. So people are worrying about buying bitcoin at while failing to realize and appreciate the macro data science perspective that is suggesting that even 35k will probably do investors quite well over the long run."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So, Ash, what are your thoughts on Rex view here regarding this 20 month moving average? I've heard it called the line in the sand for bull and bear markets. What's going on with this moving average?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, once again, it's a really interesting perspective. I'm not a technical analyst. I don't generally follow bitcoin candles. But it's interesting to hear Rekt. For me, what stood out was actually this idea of how he's talking about the bottom. What stood out to me is that he doesn't talk about finding a bottom explicitly. He talks about this as a bottoming process. And as you pointed out, Marco, on Rex view, he once again returns to that $35,000 long term price entry target that he has. So he's very consistent about his thinking about this from the big picture perspective. And that's really what stood out to me about that clip. Marco."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I totally agree with this line in the sand. When bitcoin crossed, I believe it was the 20 month moving average. When it crossed, 40,000 is when it, it dipped in. And it's like we're kind of entering this bear trend and then we're entering this bottoming process. And then he's kind of using that in conjunction with this two year moving average to kind of get an idea. Okay, well, we're below 40 now. I know we're in a bear trend, and now we're getting below 35. Is this becoming, are we getting closer to the sweet spot? And so I just, I think it's really interesting clip. And I think that brings us to our next clip here, where we get a quick but full rundown of Rex complete strategy. His dollar cost averaging, his multiple indicators, he's taking a look at."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Let's watch this clip the way I constructed my dollar cost averaging. And that's essentially the best way to go about it because trying to pinpoint the absolute bottom is, let's just say it's impossible and there's no need to try and find the absolute bottom. But dollar cost averaging, laddering those buy orders progressively. I'll shine a bit of light on how I'm doing that exactly, but I just want to highlight the three indicators that I'm paying attention to most. So this is the 20 month moving average breaking down below it, seeing price drop from the 20 month moving average, that's giving me an idea that we're going to be entering a bearishen phase in the market. And then number two, focusing on the two year moving average and dropping below that 35k region that we were talking about, that data science model. And essentially, just by just focusing on it logically and not having any emotions, that thirty five k at this point in the cycle is too high a price because bitcoin right now is 22k. But back then, a few weeks ago, I could have just started my dollar cost averaging from thirty five k and just ladder in progressively. But at the same time, I knew that the 200 week moving average is where we see downside wicking take place. So for me, it was more focusing on the 20 month moving average as these kind of alert signals that, okay, we're entering a bearish trend. And then the two year moving average, okay, we're entering the bottoming out process. Then the 200 week moving average, well, okay, it's getting narrower and narrower. This is where we're going to be seeing prices that are close to peak opportunity. Downside wicking below the 200 week moving average. So anything below 20 to 800 at this point. So the way I'm laddering, or at least dollar cost averaging, is that I'm building these ladders of buy orders that are progressively getting heavier and heavier. They're heavily weighted in terms of how much USD or GBP or Euro I'd like to purchase a bitcoin. And as bitcoins price drops down, those heavier buy orders are going to get triggered. And this is essentially the key to successful dollar cost averaging, where you're able to get cheaper bitcoin for much more. So why not use a cash to accumulate at varying price levels, but also having heavier cash at lower orders, essentially. So at this point of cycle, I'm still accumulating. There's no doubt about that. And I'm not necessarily sure where that absolute bottom is going to be, but I'm making an educated guess that there still could be one, that we're going to see a multi month bottoming out process. And once we do see some sort of capitulation wick on the monthly timeframe to at least give us some sort of signaling that a generational bottom has formed, I'll have that confidence that sideways consolidation is going to take place. But anything below 35k is a great opportunity and anything below the 200 week moving average is an even better opportunity. So anything below 22 800, but above all else right now, I know that if bitcoin dips below 20k, then that's kind of an immediate buy for me. Because right now, the problem with 2020k, what was once a psychological inflection point for dramatic price expansion, we're seeing 20k kind of get normalized in the collective mind of investors, and people are starting to not really appreciate the significance of that inflection point as we once did in the past, because we're not really seeing accompanying volatility right now in the cycle. But we have to make no mistake that anything below 20k is an outsized opportunity for investors, even evidenced by that data science model that I've been talking about. Anything below 35k is fantastic. Well then, if anything below 35k is the bottoming out period, then anything below 20k is getting us closer to that peak financial opportunity. And if you're a long term investor investing for the next few years as dictated, your investment thesis might be dictated by the halving events. I've written a four part series on the halving and how it impacts a bitcoin's price action in the RekT Capital newsletter. What we know is that we might see some sharp pre halving retraces, but of course this pre halving retrace still has a way to go. This isn't even the pre having retracement. We'll see that probably in 2024. But the most important principle to take note of is that exponential price increase occurs after the halving. And if you're just investing based on that, as I am, then dollar cost averaging anything below 20k is my main thesis right now. And just holding for up to a year after the halving, and it's really as simple as that, really."

Like, it seems like he's laddering his buy orders in such a way where he's setting the orders at lower prices, he's putting more cash in, effectively stacking on his long term portfolio. Break down Rex strategy for us."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's right, Marco. This is a really interesting clip because it reveals the way that he thinks about dollar cost averaging and getting into these positions more generally. So a couple of things stood out at me. First, he looks at multiple indicators for strategic guidance, 20 month, two year and 200 week moving average. Obviously, these are all longer term moving averages. So he's looking at this from a kind of a fundamental structural perspective on price. And exactly as you pointed out, Marco, he also talks about laddering in. Let's talk about that. Laddering is about using multiple limit orders at multiple price points to enter or exit a trade. In this case, entering the trade. And that strategy works with dollar cost averaging. It's done with the goal of obviously lowering your average weighted cost on your positions. This would be opposed to, for example, a strict price targeting strategy where you set everything in a single limit order to get in at a particular target based upon, for example, some of your technical, or indeed fundamental analysis. Final point. And this is very important for then, Rec's thesis. Rec points out that, historically speaking, exponential moves to the upside in the price of bitcoin, historically speaking, have happened after halving events. Again, this is interesting because it's a very long term kind of fundamental thesis from REct that we're hearing here. And it's worth pointing out, of course, that the next BTC having event is expected in the first half of 2024. Marco."

        "text": "Wow. So that was a lot of fascinating points. Here's like, this conversation with you has been great. It really, really helped me break down these key takeaways analyzing these clips, what I took away from it, the same thing that you were saying, it's rect capital. He's believing that anything below 35k is, for bitcoin, is a great opportunity, but anything below the 200 week moving average is even better. So he's kind of layering this thing. First he was seeing that we dropped below the 20 month moving average, that 40,000 price point. Then he's seen that we're dropping below the 35,000 on the two year moving average. And then he drops down to the 200 week moving average, and he's looking for that price point. He's saying that anything below 20k is an immediate buy for him. He's also arguing that investors need to pay attention to this having cycles. And like you mentioned, that historically there have been exponential price increases after the having. We don't know if that's going to happen again. But he's also emphasizing, and I think that something is really interesting, is the time from bear market bottoms to the next halving cycles, the amount of days. And when he's looking at this overall bottoming process, he's estimating that if we do see a lower low in bitcoin, it could potentially happen in the fourth quarter of this year, maybe even November of this year. So moving on to viewer questions. Ash, the first one we have from McUbed on the RV site, can you guys put the Solana and the bridge breaches in perspective? We've seen so many in the past few months. Is there anything significant about these particular cases, or are they just another exploit to chalk up to growing painst? What is your take here?"

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Ash? It's a great question. M cubed. Look, the short answer is second verse, same as the first. We've seen this story before. We'll probably continue to see this in the future. We now know, I think, with a reasonable degree of certainty that these challenges are lurking out there. It's in the nature, the fundamental nature of the way these code bases develop. There are these potentials for exploits. And I would add to that also to m cubes specific question about bridge breaches. Based on some of the reporting that we've done here at real vision, it very much seems that there are significant challenges with the way that the current architecture of bridges are engineered. I don't want to be sort of painting too broad a picture here in the way that I'm talking about this, but I think it's reasonable, reasonable to look at bridges with a skeptical eye. Obviously, there's some other technologies here, so called layer zero solutions, Polkadot Cosmos, that are looking to find new ways of doing cross chain protocols that aren't based on a software bridge per se. I suspect we're going to probably hear more about those efforts just because of some of the challenges that we've seen to date in the protocols that are transferred from one chain to another with bridges."

        "text": "Marko, it's looking at bridges with a skeptical eye. This reminds me of your conversation with Corby prior, where he was talking about how important the consensus layer is. I mean, definitely something that we need to keep an eye on. The next question to talk about. Absolutely. CorBy if you're watching, hit us up on our email. So Ralph Humphrey from the RV site, he's asking, could ash discuss a little bit about the CME's rollout of the euro denominated bitcoin and Ethereum futures? What is your take on that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Great question, Ralph. Look, I would say I don't really have any specific insights into the mechanics of the rollout. This is obviously a story, story that's breaking here this morning. But I will say this 50,000 foot perspective, clearly it's a sign that implies broader adoption of Ethereum and a broader interest in Ethereum and the ability for investors to come into those exposures from a broader array of currencies. It's hard to see as this is anything but big picture bullish on the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. Marko?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, no, definitely agreed. And I love that, your 50,000 foot overview. I mean, you really break it down really great when it comes to that."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I was pointing out the obvious, Marco."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Absolutely, absolutely. So the next question, again from Ralph Humphrey. Once proof of work is gone, miners will be gone. What effect might a bunch of these professional grade computers departing the network have?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "This is an interesting question as well. I'll give you the short answer. The short answer is nobody knows. It hasn't happened yet. This is a massive transition that's going to be taking place. He's talking about, I assume, Ethereum and the merge here with the transition from proof of work to proof of stake. It's a really interesting question about what can be done with that hash power. I think that sort of the way that I would think about it, at least broadly speaking, is this is an effort that's been compared to swapping out the engines of a jet airplane at a cruising altitude of 50,000ft. So I think the heart of his question is really, is what are the externalities about this going to be? And I've sort of talked about this before. You can run things in testnet, even when you run things at Testnet, it's something that attempts to emulate some layer of scale. It's really hard to know how these things shake out in production where there's actual money involved. Now, look, we should say that beacon chain is running today, but this is going to be a massive shift in the amount of dollars at stake and therefore the precise implications of exactly what's going to happen in this ecosystem are at this moment unknown."

We got another great episode of Ral's adventures in crypto for you. Tomorrow we raoul sat down with Dan Moorhead of Pantera Capital, and they discuss their differing opinions on the crypto and macro landscape. No other conversation is more important than talking about crypto and macro. Obviously, macro affecting us tremendously. Check that interview out. Airing tomorrow. See you next week live on real vision, crypto daily briefing."
