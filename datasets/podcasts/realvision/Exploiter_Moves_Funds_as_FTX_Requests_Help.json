We discuss the latest developments as funds are on the move again. We'll be joined by Geneva rock dector and Thomas Brazil. So stay tuned for this show. I'm Elaine Lee, your friendly crypto host and producer. Ash Bennington is with me this morning. Ashley, I read on your twitter that you're feeling a little bit queasy. Care to elaborate?"

News flow suggests there's rising systemic and contagion risk with liquidity and counterparty issues. But the price of bitcoin and ethereum just stays eerily range bound. Hopefully, it passes uneventfully. We shall see. Look, I tweeted this out on Friday night, November 18. This last Friday, bitcoin was trading at around 16,625. Obviously, we've lost the 16 handles since then. Look, the thesis here, or the, or this, the summation of this tweet, really, I should say, is that we're experiencing this period of clearly rising systemic risk, rising contagion risk. There was liquidity and counterparty issues in the system, and yet the price throughout the weekend remained largely pinned in this very sort of narrow range bound corridor. You have to wonder what folks in the space are thinking, and if there's some sort of mechanistic effect. I don't know whether it's people taking physical delivery of the coin that's supporting the price. There are all kinds of theories floating around out there. But look, bottom line, it certainly seems like we are in a far, far riskier period than we were, Elaine, before the FTX collapse."

All right, let's jump straight into the price action. So cryptocurrency prices has resumed falling. BTC briefly fell below 16,000 over the weekend before recovering slightly. Bitcoin is currently hovering around that level and is down around 2.5% for the past week, according to blockchain analytics firm. Into the block, more than half of all addresses holding bitcoin are now in the red. It's the first time more than half of bitcoin investors have made paper losses on their initial investment since March 2020.

That's despite a high profile endorsement from a famed tradfi investor, Bill Ackman. It's a U turn for Ackman, who said he was previously skeptical of crypto.

Are we talking about the $3 billion that's owed to creditors based on court filings over the weekend, the $16 billion in customer account funds, 10 billion of which seem to have been lent to Alameda Research, the sister company that may or may not have been vaporized in trading losses?

But I, through all sorts of incompetence and wrongdoing, but I'm talking about the funds, Ash, that was lost on 11 November, right after when FTX filed for bankruptcy in the US. Some $600 million are estimated to have been lost in the exploit. Lots of theories flying around quicker than I can scroll through my own damn Twitter timeline. But what do we know? Ash, can you fill me in on that?"

Was one of the biggest holders of Ethereum in the world. In the world. That's a pretty extraordinary statement. Now, he or she or they started transferring some of it into Ren BTC. Ren BTC, for those who may not know, is a token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and it's pegged to the value of bitcoin. It's a bridge that allows the use of bitcoin on another blockchain. So basically it's a wrapped bitcoin product that's being traded on Ethereum and that you can use. Interoperability with the use of Ren is notable because according to Coindesk, in 2021, Alameda Research, the sandbank Manfred owned trading company at the center of the scandal, or partially owned by Sam Bankman, Fried said Ren's development team was, quote, joining, close quote, Alameda and would work on expanding Ren's usage to several different blockchains. FTX is asking other exchanges to help it recover those lost funds that it said were transferred without authorization to other exchanges throughout intermediate wallets. Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question. It just fuels the conspiracy theories. Why is it that the funds have been transferred to a coin, in this case Ren BTC, that Alameda research clearly had ties to? It's complicated story. We don't really know those answers yet, Elaine, but we're just going to watch this story and we're going to report these facts as they come out in real time."

And I felt compelled to start making content about this on TikTok. So I started making videos that were content that the general public could consume. Because to your point, this is a complicated story. So much money moving around, who did what, who's who in the zoo. Like, it's just so dizzying, right? And so here we are today, and there's been. There's contagion across the entire sector. People are taking money off of crypto exchange is at a rapid pace, I think, probably a record pace. People are not trusting their money on exchanges. We had over the weekend, the largest legal holder of bitcoin, the Grayscale BTGBTC trust, come out and say, you know, we have your bitcoin here. It's at Coinbase, but we're not going to tell you exactly what the address is. We're not going to fully give you proof of reserves. But they had Coinbase sign off on it, you know, and we know Coinbase is a financial services business. They're public company, they're audited, they're regulated by the SEC. So hopefully that is truthful. But, you know, that closed end fund, which is the largest holder of bitcoin, is trading at a 50% discount. So. Yeah, and then there's just, there's just so many shoes to drop here. It's really hard to keep track of it all. But Twitter and the content on Twitter has just been absolutely amazing.

I mean, some companies are literally just caught in macro headwinds and need to restructure the balance sheets. But many times when the bottle falls out of market, you see who's swimming naked. And this is no different, I guess, in the crypto fallout or c five fallout. I don't want to call it crypto fallout, I want to call it c five. But it's interesting to see some of the facts that are coming out. The movement around wallets post petition is very unorthodox. In a traditional bankruptcy, you wouldn't see money flowing around from bank account to bank account and we'll see where that comes out. Post fish movements of crypto. If unauthorized, who knows, maybe it raises to the level of bankruptcy fraud or something. That could be criminality and we'll see what goes. What. There's so much going on right now, it's kind of hard to not to be following everything or to follow everything. And crypto, Twitter has been all over it. I'm just blown away at the level of engagement and just the amount of kind of real time analysis going on. It's amazing. Take a simple thing like whether the property is held in trust or whether it's general and secured claim. I mean, you can learn more about this topic by being on Twitter and $1500 an hour lawyers tweeting out stuff. It's actually good content. So it's pretty amazing to me to watch the community sort of go live on these issues and then people that are regular, you know, sort of creditors just unearthing pretty amazing information. So unprecedented. So."

I'm no crypto expert in the Bahamas, so I don't know exactly if, you know, we know that he violated or they violated FTX, violated their terms of services with the crypto that was supposed to be custodied. But violating a terms of service versus breaking the law into fraud territory is quite. Those are, those are different things. They carry different weight. Absolutely.

I am not an attorney, but these are incredibly, incredibly complicated issues that we're about to sort through here and we're about to sort through them in real time. I mean, my sense the Wall Street Journal was reporting, I think about seven days ago that they are being investigated at FTX by the Department of Justice. Obviously, Department of Justice means it's criminal. I suspect that the magnitude of the losses here are going to create the demand for some pretty high resources over at DOJ to figure out just what the heck happened. But it's really, we're kind of, we're kind of here in terra incognito. We really just don't know how this is going to be prosecuted. We don't know how this is going to be taken from the. From the civil regulatory side, either. But let me just ask you this, Genevieve. You have been in this, in the traditional finance world, what people in crypto call tradfi, what we tend to call capital markets, for a very long time. You're a CFA charter holder. You know, I've seen you talk a little bit on camera about some of the things that were happening at FTX. The absence of financial controls, the absence of proper procedures. Give us a little bit of a sense for people who don't have your capital markets background just what happened and just how unusual it is."

Did they never have a segregated fund for the crypto assets that are customer assets? Or were those always commingled gold? Or back in the summer when you had the whole Luna collapse in the three arrow capital? Like, is that when they got into real trouble because they had lent out money through Alameda to all these other crypto companies, and they weren't getting that money back as those companies went bankrupt. And then they said, oh, you know, like, we need to plug this hole. Is that when it happened? Because I think it really speaks to sort of the intent, the criminal intent in this case is when this happened. If it happened from the start, then the whole thing was set up from the start to not be legal, because those weren't their assets. Customer assets are not company assets. And I think that's the biggest point that really frustrates me by this whole thing, because we've seen this happen before with other exchanges. This isn't the first time."

        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Well, MF Global was regulated. So this is the other question that this brings up. Is everyone saying, more regulation, more regulation? Yes, we need more regulation because I think the lack of clarity that the SEC is providing in terms of what's a security and what is not a security has pushed companies to have these offshore exchanges just because they don't want to get in trouble in the United States. But that's just pushed a lot of this business offshore. So that's, you know, that's one, that's one problem with it. But the other problem is the financial statements of this company are extremely complex. Right? Like, even just their chart, if you looked at how the company was organized, it was extremely complex. But the financial statements, like, even the bankruptcy proceeding documents that were released last week, the 30 page report, it speaks to the fact that, like, the client assets were nowhere recorded on any of the balance sheets. So you can just imagine some of these meetings that may have happened with the VC firms where they said, oh, yeah, we've got 16 billion in client assets sitting over here. Meanwhile, they weren't talking about how they were being lent out or bored against, and the collateral was their own token. Like, you have to go a level deeper when you're not dealing with audited financial statements, you're dealing with a private company and you're dealing with complicated intercompany relationships between assets."

Big no, no. So it's interesting to see, you know, that, you know, you know, these would be much more regulated. And I agree with the comment about pushing stuff offshore is unfortunate because there's been really no regular regulation or regulatory framework other than, like, regulation by enforcement in crypto space. So pushing to the criminality. I'm not a criminal lawyer. I'm really just a bankruptcy guy. But clearly, who knows? Investor fraud, what did he show these VC's when they invested in him and whatnot? And then you have pushing to, I don't know, wire fraud, money laundering, if there are other things, not following the terms and conditions, maybe he gets around the fact that, you know, technically there were no regulations compared, you know, about like how you could dip into it. So maybe it's a breach of trust, breach of duty as a director to the, to the shareholders and to the, to the customers. But it's not a, it's not a criminal offense, you know, I don't know, I just think, can I throw something out as a bankruptcy guy? Yeah, that's not super important. In fact, you know, things going criminal is only going to complicate matters. And the DOJ is going to want their pound of flesh. So once they get their teeth, and if you sign some sort of civil forfeiture or something, then the state has to now go argue with the DOJ over what's theirs and what they can keep. And, you know, once they get their teeth in, it's like, geez. Because civil forfeitures aren't, you know, you basically negotiate with the DOJ. There's no like court process for that. And just to throw this out, the 30 page report that was put out there, that's super preliminary. Nothing in there. I mean, I think a lawyer would say dispositive of anything. Meaning it's just, hey, I'm giving you what I got. It's, you know, they don't have to put investor, you know, sort of compliance safeguards on it. But basically this is like a buyer beware. Best we can do right now, sort of snapshot, because they're supposed to proffer it to the court as they have it. But it's in good faith.

It's extremely likely to be revealed. One, anybody that's owning this through a business or an entity is 100% being revealed. And two, and individuals are likely to have their information revealed to some extent. Now some of their information will be suppressed. Maybe they're, you know, like they're normally you'd see everything, but maybe it's just their name in their mouth, or maybe it's just their last name, first initial amount, but the names are going to come out of who owns the stuff. And my understanding of early FTX claimants, you weren't allowed to open it in a business entity. So a lot of those are individuals. But the bankruptcy, especially in America, is a very transparent process, or the chapter eleven process is very transparent. No judge is going to allow, creditors have actually allowed proof of claims without having some idea of who they are. It's not fair to the pros, it's not fair to the creditors, and it's against case law. This is ridiculous. I mean, Sullivan and Cromwell's motion is dead on arrival.

The bankruptcy court is going to require it to come out. And if you notice people filing proof of claims, if they file as an individual, it's redacted. If they file as a business, you see the business name. So if you want to go to the docket and look for the businesses that have exposure, you can see that none of the big creditors have filed yet. There's no, what's called bar date. There's no reason to file it this early. But hey, some people, everybody knows them.

For the US bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York to set a deadline for claims that has been approved. Customers have until the 3 January to submit proof of claim.

So I don't know if you saw that, but I can easily send you a link to it. But yes, on the bar date, a bar date is you have to file a proof of claim before that bar date. But if a debtor files a chapter eleven, you have what's called a deemed file claim. It's not legal advice, but you basically, if your scheduled amount that you got in the mail, Elaine, you probably got, you know, this in the mail, it says, hey, you have this amount of claim. If you agree with that amount, you basically have to do, you don't have to do anything. If you want about the abundance of caution, file a claim with the supporting documentation, go for it. And if you disagree with the amount or the characterization of your claim when you read that form they send you, then you should go and file a proof of claim. Or if you think for whatever reason you have some additional damages that you'd like to pursue, you should file that in your proof of claim as well. And, you know, you should seek legal advice if you're talking about real dollars. But if you're sort of a more ordinary creditor and you're comfortable with what they've scheduled you at, you shouldn't need to do anything, and you should just stay up to date on the docket and, you know, try to remember that there's more to life than, you know, following a bankruptcy docket, hopefully. But if unfortunately, you're stuck in it, you know, follow the docket. You shouldn't have to do anything if you agree with the scheduled amount that you've been given."

        "text": "Recovery? Oh, Jesus. Whisper numbers. I always think it's funny when people think distress firms have some special knowledge. They must know some sort of secret. There's a secret cabal of us getting together and talking about recovery numbers. Yes, you do compare those to people, but anywhere between, it was looking like potentially over 50% with the drop in bitcoin. Of course, the recoveries kind of drop on a dollar basis, and then you have to think about like, well, okay, there's FTX exposure as well. So you got to knock out the FTT tokens now, and you got to knock out whatever kind of intercompany stuff or not intercompany, but any sort of, you know, sort of exposure you had to FTX. And then the mining side, you got to now think the mining is worth less because bitcoin's down a bunch. So, you know, take the numbers. The last time I was looking at the numbers, it looked like somewhere between 40 low forties look like a decent peg on a recovery number. And that's just being honest. It's basically, you're looking at the crypto, you're looking at GK eight, and you're looking at the mining assets. I'm not sure the mining assets are worth as much as people originally thought in the petition, because if you think about where they are in the process, from what I've heard from talking to sources, and if you think about where mining as a business is, you know, you sort of. It takes money to make money in the mining business. And so you can't sell those assets for as much as you think because on paper, it looks great. But in practice, you need, you know, $60 million or $40 million of hardware, and that's hard to bridge. And so to sell it to somebody, you don't get full price. You got to kind of give somebody a good deal. So, I mean, I'm not that close to the mining business, but I'm just saying that I think we need to be realistic about what that could be worth. And, hey, you know. Yeah, those are the numbers."

They're all over the world. And you really have some good faith defenses. You have what's called God. I wish I could remember the code now because I look really smart. But you have ordinary business course defense. You have ordinary business terms defense, which are. You're just doing something under the terms of your contract. So those are great pushbacks. The ordinary business terms was added in BaPSi, which is the bankruptcy code update in 2005. So a lot of people don't know about it. A lot of bankruptcy attorneys need to read BapSi. It's like, you got to keep up your course curriculum for CFA. Like, some of these lawyers should be trying to make sure they keep up on that Bapsi changes. And then you also have probably one forgetting. And then you also have what's called safe harbor, which you would get. It's a 546 e safe harbor for basically commodities and security transactions that go through financial intermediaries. This was to stop contagion within the financial industry. So this was added years ago by financial lobbyists to basically stop contagion. Okay, so those are the ones you have. And then in addition to that, now with let's move on to FTX, you have this issue of who owns the property. So if your property never changed hands and you had title the whole time, well, then clearly there's no clawback. What would you be clawing back? The property was never yours. So how would you be clawing back your property? It was never yours. So that's an interesting argument, but let me put a little. Let me put some wrinkles or let me put some caveats on those arguments. One, I think there are a few different groups of clawbacks. You talk about democratic donations. Okay, let's look at that one for a second. That's one group. Any sort of donations or things like that, those are considered gifts under the bankruptcy code. Sometimes they're considered entertainment, but mostly gifts. And if you look, they're 100% subject to clawbacks. People can call them clawbacks. There's only really two avoidance sections of the US bankruptcy code, and that's a preference or fraudulent transfer. Those would be clear. Either preferences or fraudulent transfers. It was for non equivalent value. It was within look back period. And, you know, the debtor did not get equivalent value, which is kind of the standard. And we have to also argue that the debtor was involved in time to transfer. So it would be interesting to know if it was before Terra Luna or after and when they become came, quote unquote insolvent. So that's one bucket."

That was one bucket. And then there was a third bucket where, and those guys are probably the safest. And then another bucket that probably has more exposure with the guys using the back doors. I don't know if you guys reported on this, but the guys going out of the Bahamas, people switching nfts and then trying to go off platform, this kind of, I wouldn't call it shenanigans, I would sell creativity.

Clearly the call like a Comey, but you're like your center of business interest was clearly in the Bahamas and yet you're trying to do a chapter eleven like come on. And also like they have egg on their face. They let, I wouldn't call it the biggest ponzi scheme in history, but I, they let a pretty big fraud happen under their watch and now they want to clean it up. They don't want someone else to clean it up. And John Ray, the guy, that's the new sort of, I guess I'd call him a CRO, but CEO, I guess to run this bankruptcy process, he was probably a little aggressive in calling out the lack of corporate oversight because then it makes the Bahamians look like it's a mess and that they've done, they haven't done a good job of like monitoring their own entities. So I can understand why they're stepping forward and trying to take jurisdictional control over the bahamian liquidation, I think it's going to be a battle royale. I think at the end of the day, I prefer to stay in eleven in Delaware and not be in the Bahamas. Someone in the Bahamas is going to get mad at me for saying this, but the last time I did a liquidation or worked on something, the Bahamas, it was an absolute nightmare. Very mercurial rulemaking and kind of more stakeholder driven than creditor driven. And I just think, as a creditor, you don't want to see that. So, I'm sorry, Bahamas, but you're right, there are big questions. It is going to be a battle royale. You're going to have seriously expensive lawyers arguing about this for the next couple of weeks."

Supposedly they custody their bitcoin at Coinbase, which is a publicly traded company. It's a financial services business in the United States. Audited financial statements regulated by the SEC. Greyscale, who owns this fund, this closed end fund, came out and said that their bitcoin is safe and it's custodied at Coinbase, but they're not going to reveal the addresses of the wallets where it's held because of confidentiality and worries around that. So that made crypto Twitter exploded with, like, why wouldn't you, you know, prove the reserves? And so now this trust is continuing to trade at a massive discount. So it's either the most amazing trade in history buying this thing at a 50% discount, or the entire crypto space is in serious effing trouble if Coinbase is not holding this bitcoin.

I think it's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. And so you buy the units, and I think you can redeem the units for actual bitcoin. I'm not sure on this one specifically."

So this trust used to trade at a premium when it first came out, because there wasn't really any way for big institutions to get access to bitcoin in a massive way. So it was an 100% premium? It was 100%, yeah, it was, like, a high demand. But then as more products came out and more ways to hold, crypto came out, it started trading at, you know, down. It hit net asset value. So that's when it's trading at the value of what it's holding. Now it's trading at a discount to the value of what it's holding. So it's trading at a 50% discount. So if they do, in fact, hold the bitcoin and you buy it today, and they actually prove this, it should, at some point, go back to net asset value. So there's a 50% upside, potentially. But again, that's only if the bitcoin is actually there. We don't know for sure. So that's the problem here."

Arbitrageur slash liquidator activist guys. And, you know, these aren't. This isn't really a closed in fund. I mean, I guess this has been known for a while, but it's not a closed in fund. Barry Silver is a genius for setting this thing up, is an ironclad contract to manage it. The fee is too high, and who pays 2% a year to hold bitcoin? But the discount's there, and it's kind of juicy and nice. So it's kind of one of those things where, as you said early on, there weren't any products, and this was the only source. And now it's a now that we're in a winter, it's probably a very interesting vehicle to be looking at as someone that just wants raw exposure. They can buy infidelity to something. So I kind of think it's interesting. I mean, I think the discount could get even wider if we see troubles from Genesis. But you can't always totally pick the bottom."

And I think we're at peak fear right now, frankly, in my opinion. I need people that are very scared now. They just got their face ripped off, and they're now looking at $0.05 on the dollar to sell their FTX claim. But I think, in general, I think Paul Graham had a tweet the other night. It was amazing. From Paul Graham, of all people, talking about a good friend of his in crypto is very scared that there's, like, more to come. And I'm just like, God, so cryptic. And it's from Paul Graham, who you want to just absolutely love. So it's hard, I tell you. It's like I always say, when we're investing money in the stress, you sort of. You not only. You're not high fiving yourself when you're doing it, you're kind of I won't curse, but you're pretty scared. You're basically just like, wow, this is really scary. Are we sure we want to do this? And that's probably means, hopefully it means that you're closer to the bottom than the top, but you know, and I think oak tree has it. Right.

And they have pulled back in their, their earn program that they had with Gemini. That's suspicious and weird. I think, you know, from the institutional side, what I'm hearing from wealth managers and funds that were exposed to this stuff is they're now having to explain to their clients and their investors, like, why they're pulling out what's happening here. And those conversations take a long time to have. They don't just happen overnight. Like this has just transpired in the last like seven days. Right. And so I think you're going to see more exits. People are just going to go to the sideline on this sector until we have more regulation, more proof of reserves, more certainty. The thing is, like we want to speculate in the industry, we want to speculate on this amazing sector, but we want, don't want to speculate as to whether our crypto is available for us to pull out. That's the problem. And so I think if there's, I think we're probably near to the bottom than the top. Of course that's what I think. But I think there's more pain to come. More pain."

What is the security? We still don't know. It's very unclear still in the US, and that's what pushed crypto businesses offshore and, you know, landed to where we are today. So we need. When you need to go, uh. So you need to go deeper into the books when you're involved with these kind of businesses. The second is, uh, the bankruptcy procedures are messy, long, and customers usually get a lot, uh, less than what they had invested into their platform. And unfortunately, we're all getting more versed in bankruptcy law with such high profile failures this year, like Voyager, Celsius, and FTX, just to name a few. And the last thing that we picked up is, speaking of FTX, there is an ongoing legal battle over jurisdiction between the US and the Bahamas. That's the. With questions swirling around with FTX funds, where they are, what's been stolen and by whom, so safe to say, the new FTX leadership, judges and regulators have a big mess to basically clean up.
