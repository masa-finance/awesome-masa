We'll be joined live by the chamber of Digital Commerce CEO Perry Ann boring to discuss this crypto regulation and lots more. Welcome back to real Vision crypto Daily briefing. Happy Friday, everyone. I'm Elaine Lee, your friendly crypto host and producer. So let's jump straight into the price action for today. Yesterday we celebrated bitcoin, reaching 18,000. Today it's above 19,000. Bitcoin is up more than 5% on the day and double digits on a trailing seven day basis. Interestingly, bitcoin is making a much bigger percentage move than ether. We've usually seen the opposite over the past few months. ETH is up about 2% in the past 24 hours on a weekly basis. It's not far off. Bitcoin ETH is changing hands at 1400. Let's take a dip into the topical news stories in the crypto landscape. Now, remember how Gemini and Genesis have been embroiled in an ongoing battle over earn. Earn was the yield earning program on Gemini, the crypto exchange where assets were lent out to its partner, Genesis, the crypto lender. Two companies with very similar names. I get it, but bear with me. So, due to the ongoing market turmoil, Genesis halted redemptions in back in November, effectively locking up some $900 million in Gemini earn user funds. Since then, a very public battle between the two camps has been playing out on Twitter, you've read them and getting increasingly uglier. So adding to the drama, we have a regulator stepping in. The US securities and Exchange Commission has sued both Genesis and Gemini. Now, luckily, I have a co worker frantically messaging me at 02:00 a.m. who's been keeping a close eye on this very story. Ash, I have the right person with me to tell me exactly what's going on. I know you've been looking into this very SEc complaint."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, let's jump right in here. And I just want to go through the complaint, give people a bit of an understanding of what's happening here. So just right off the bat here, quote, defendants offered and sold the Gemini earn agreements through the Gemini earn program without registering the offer and sale with the SEC as required by federal securities laws. So they're coming out of the gate swinging, essentially making the case very clearly, very directly, that in the view of SEC, these contracts are, these are investment contracts. The earn programs is investment contracts, and these therefore are covered by their regulatory jurisdiction. I just want to keep going through the complaint here and explain a little bit about what's happening. Quote, as a result, investors lack material information about the Gemini earn program that would have been relevant to their investment decisions. That's important because that's part of securities offerings. You have to make material disclosures in, quote, instead of providing investors with a full panoply of information required by the federal securities laws, defendants have instead only made selective and inadequate disclosures. And this quote here, pretty devastating. It gives you a sense of why they're weighing in right now and coming in, uh, so hard. Quote, the us retail investors who participated in the Gemini, urn, program have suffered significant harm. So it's right on the tiny lane. Uh, in the view of SEC, these are clearly securities. Uh, obviously that will need to be adjudicated in federal courts. Additionally, there have been significant harms, uh, in the view of SEc, uh, to the investors in these products. They just come right out and say exactly what, uh, you know, we've been hearing in terms of their views and speeches. But now in this case, they're filing suit in the southern district of New York. This is a pretty significant story, Elaine."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, there's so much happening. But, Ash, is there anything that you can tell me about what the broader implication does this mean for the space overall? Like, why should we care?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, absolutely. Elaine, I want to go to the press release here to just make two important points. First on this specific case, and then more broadly to answer your question about why we should all care. So SEC says in the press release, quote, the complaint seeks permanent injunctive, injunctive relief disgorgement of ill gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties. What they're saying here is we're going after these companies essentially with a whole wide variety of different types of actions. This is pretty significant in terms of this particular suit to these companies in terms of what SEC wants injunctive relief, meaning they want to stop them from offering these products in the future. I don't know if we can put this up on the screen right now, but we've got some tweets here from Tyler Winklevoss that are interesting and that relate to precisely this point. So this is obviously a tweet thread coming out from Tyler Winklevoss. The first tweet in the thread begins, quote, it's disappointing that the SEC chose SEC gov, that's the Twitter handle, chose to file an action today. This is written last night as Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action has nothing to further our efforts and help earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive. A very strong statement coming from Tyler Winklevoss, obviously one of the founders of Gemini. And then he goes on to say, we look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket. Strong language, and we will make sure this doesn't distract us from the important recovery work that we are doing. But seriously, what is the point or urgency here? The earn program has been shut down for almost two months. Well, in terms of injunctive relief, what the SEC is saying here is in the event that this is, uh, they become solvent or they can begin making redemptions again, they're going to seek injunctive relief. In other words, they're going to seek to bar, uh, these organizations from participating further in these earned programs. And they're telling you precisely why, because they believe, uh, it's a security, you know, in the documents, Elaine, if you walk through it, uh, they actually go through on page 17. We've talked about the Howey test here on this show. It's really fascinating. It's a prong, by prong, walk through the Howey test, talking about precisely why SEC believes it meets the definition of those critical prongs of the Howey test. Now to get to your other question, which was about how this could have a broader impact in the space, here's a line from the press release that I think is most telling. Quote, investigations into other securities laws violations and into other entities and persons related to the alleged misconduct are ongoing. They're saying this is something that we're looking at very broadly. If there are other individuals or organizations that have participated in activities that we believe violate our securities laws. We're going after them too, Elaine. That's my view at least, or interpretation of what this document says."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Thank you, Ash. I really appreciate you breaking that down for me and why this all matters and how it all marries together. Talking about marrying together, I know that this is not the only development concerning Genesis, its parent company, DCG, is reportedly looking to raise cash. What is the context here?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So according to the Financial Times, Genesis owes its creditors some $3 billion. This is new reporting. We haven't heard that $3 billion number before. In fact, I remember when it was $1 billion, then it was $2 billion. This $3 billion, obviously a huge number. So its parent company, Digital currency group, is trying to plug that gap. According to sources speaking to the FT, DCG is looking at potentially selling assets from its vast investment portfolio. The FT says DCG's venture capital holdings include 200 crypto related projects such as exchanges, banks and custodians in at least 35 countries. The portfolio is reportedly worth around $500 million. DCG previously tried to raise outside funding in the past, but failed. Look, Elaine, two notable points here. First, that in the SEC transaction, and you'll see how these two stories tie together. SEC refers to DCG as a related party. This is important, of course, because it shows that credit creditors might. Might. In fact, in one exchange from, I believe Holland has already done so, go after DCG, the parent company, to attempt to recover debts incurred by Genesis, the operating company. I know this is confusing and all the names sound the same, but it is an important point and I think it's important for people to understand it. Secondly, just some basic math here. One of the problems with these stories, Elaine, is that the numbers get so big that it's easy to lose track of what matters here. So this $3 billion number obviously is huge. But let's play a game called divide by a million. Divide that $3 billion by a million, you get 3000. Divide the $500 million in the venture capital portfolio by a million, you get 500. So, Elaine, let me ask you this. If you have $500 in assets and $3,000 in debt, is that something, that position that you would want to be in? Obviously, we don't know if DCG has other assets, other ability to raise money from other sources. But the numbers. The numbers on the surface do not look, uh, especially optimistic. I think it's fair to say."

That they've been saying essentially over the last several months, many months are coming out now in lawsuits against major companies in this space, genesis and Gemini specifically. They're saying absolutely unequivocally, we believe these are securities. Uh, in fact, I believe it's probably reasonable to interpret, uh, that this is sort of a tipping of the hand about what we're going to see to other, toward other centralized earn products in the future. In terms of the DCG. Excuse me, specific story coming out of the Ft this morning, I think you could say the numbers here are just simply growing. And obviously, based on the assets versus liabilities that we've seen there appear, appear, and we don't know, again, what other sources of funding or what other sources of assets have, seem to be imbalanced and they seem to be far larger on the liability side than on the asset side right now.

I think I just want to start off by asking you, in your opinion, what are some of the most pressing regulatory developments for crypto in 2023, or if there's a certain policy that will really excite the industry as a whole, if there is a significant change? Because I feel regulation policy is so crucial this year."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, there's a lot happening underway from the policy perspective, and some of this is going to carry over from the 117th Congress and from the year 2022 as a whole, Congress really took a huge step forward and their sophistication of their understanding and policymaking towards digital assets. There was a lot of progress made in terms of members getting more educated and up to speed on the technology and the political issues. So they are better suited now than they were even just a couple of years ago to take action. In the previous Congress, the 117th Congress, there were 80 pieces of legislation that were introduced regarding digital assets and blockchain technology. Many of those, we use the word died but didn't pass, and they'll have to be reintroduced. We are expecting to see a lot of them reintroduced. As someone who used to work on capital oil, I can tell you not a lot of pieces of legislation that get introduced become law. But they do set the conversation and the debate pieces. 2% of legislation introduced will become law. So let's just talk about the ones that I think are the biggest priority for the 118th Congress. At the very top of that list is stablecoins. We have interest from both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate to pass legislation building a federal legal framework for stablecoins. Mind you, stablecoins exist already today. They're regulated by the states. So this would be giving them a charter on the federal level and potentially preempting them from the states. There is a lot of debate about what is the most appropriate step forward. Should the states still continue to have a role of overseeing stablecoin arrangements or not? Where should this license be put? At the Federal Reserve? The fed wants it, or maybe the occ. The OCC in the previous administration really looked to bring stable coins under their jurisdiction. They issued a whole bunch of letters, if you remember, that the Biden administration came in and retracted all those letters. The OCC already has jurisdiction to do this. They don't really need legislation to do that. So stablecoins is at the very top of the list. But there's still a lot of pieces that are being debated in terms of what that's exactly going to look like. The next policy priority for digital assets, that is a huge debate across all agencies and committees, is crypto market infrastructure. So questions like, how do you define which digital assets are considered securities and which ones are commodities? The SEC chair, Gensler, has been very vocal about wanting to bring the crypto exchanges under his jurisdiction. CFTC already has jurisdiction over digital asset commodities like bitcoin. So that piece is going to be a huge theme of key actions taken this year. And then the last kind of piece that I would add in terms of what we're following is oversight. So, as you know, the House is flipped. Republicans are now in the majority, and particularly on the House, Financial Services committee. Oversight is going to be a huge priority for House Republicans. We are hearing one of the first hearings in the House Financial Services committee will be with SEC chairman Gary Gensler. He did not come in for any oversight hearings last year. Many Republicans really want to bring him in front of the committee to scrutinize his approach to digital assets so we can expect to see oversight activities like hearings, subpoenas and other things like that."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. So, Perianne, I'm really someone who I would say is more pro crypto. Really happy to hear that over in DC that people are getting a little bit more sophisticated with learning about how the crypto policies are building out. I feel like people in the relevant agencies and the players, people recognizing more of their names, who to go to for what sort of question. And that really is something that's coming more to light, I feel, as I cover crypto on from an hour to hour basis, doing more of this by 50 hours a week. So that's quite reassuring to hear. And we'll definitely touch on a little bit about stable coins, especially for someone who is british, living in America. I see what the UK is doing with establishing, definitely going ahead with the stable coin. So we definitely dig a little bit further into that. Yesterday, before just having this conversation with you, I was like, I really don't know what to ask Perrianne because she's over everything and there's so much to learn continuously in the world of crypto policy. So the news guards did sort of come up to me and I read and picked up a piece from the Politico and the headlines was saying something like, us Republican to set up a crypto committee. So according to the report in political that came out, and you can see the headline right here, it says that US House Republicans are looking to set up a new subcommittee to oversee cryptocurrencies. Incoming financial services chair Patrick McHenry told political he thinks that's a big gap to fill on the committee as it spends more time in crypto. I think number one is ok, you said that the whole crypto DC scene is sort of getting more sophisticated with the scene. But what do you make of this? Because not only, I think more sophistication is needed, but my God, do people have bandwidth for it. What do you make of it now that there's this whole incoming crypto committee?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, it's a couple of things. And we launched the chamber eight years ago in 2014. So we've been involved in crypto policy conversations on the Hill for almost a decade. And I can tell you one of the biggest challenges the industry has always faced, particularly dealing with Congress, is that a lot of people just don't understand it. If you don't understand the technology, it's going to be very hard to make policy related to this technology. So the fact that we now have a subcommittee and the Health Financial services Committee dedicated to digital assets shows that we are a priority. Digital assets is a top priority for the 118th Congress and particularly for Republicans. Patrick McHenry has done extensive work already in this space. He has introduced and co sponsored a number of pieces of legislation. I mentioned there were 80 pieces of legislation introduced last Congress. There's a number of those that we support and would be very positive developments for the industry, that he played a critical role in getting introduced. So we, you know, we have great support from the chairman. And then creating the subcommittee shows and really demonstrates by action that crypto policy will be a priority for this committee. Just a little bit of history about this committee, so we are, the financial services committee already had a fintech committee, and crypto has been a part of those conversations. But now that it is a subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and inclusion, shows that this is even a bigger priority. Some of the other things to note about this subcommittee is that it will be chaired by Representative French Hill. French hill has been a supporter and a proponent of CBDCs last focus on cryptocurrencies specifically. So I think that's an interesting choice, and I think the jury's out in terms of how this committee will focus on cryptocurrency, given that the person leading it is more focused on cbdcs than crypto. But the vice chair is Congressman Warren Davidson, who I don't believe is a proponent for CBDCs. So it may be interesting to see how they work together. But Congressman Davidson is truly a freedom fighter, someone who is a big believer in bitcoin, big believer in crypto, because of critical elements of this technology that allow people to preserve privacy and other things that really align with american values. So I think this is a positive development overall, but it really shows that crypto is going to be a big priority, not only for this committee, but for this Congress."

Because you know who the relevant players are. You know who code authored and wrote what and you know what who the real key players are in DC. So the US has dual banking system, I was reading, meaning digital assets can be regulated at a state level and a federal level. The US is big when it comes down to who makes decisions and who does what. Different US governing bodies, the SEC and the CFTC are squabbling over power and responsibilities. Whilst it sounds everything is getting a little bit more into place, what happens if they don't get their act together is my question."

        "text": "Well, where we are right now, the challenges for the industry is regulatory clarity. We have a lot of cooks in the kitchen. There's a lot of agencies that have jurisdiction over different parts of digital assets. SEC, they have jurisdiction over digital asset securities, but we don't really know exactly which digital assets are securities and which ones are not. CFTC, they oversee digital asset commodities. We know bitcoin is a commodity, but we don't really have specific clarity around many others. They point to the howey test, but they still don't give you specific clarity. Treasury IR's Tax fence and anti money laundering Bank Secrecy act. You also have DOJ. We've seen a number of actions from the DOJ in the space recently, consumer protections like the CFPB and the FTC. So the bigger challenge for this industry is having regulatory clarity, which is why there's been a huge focus on Congress, because we really need Congress to ultimately create the taxonomy for which agencies are going to have jurisdiction over what types of digital assets and what type of activities involving blockchain and providing the framework. So industry knows how to follow the rules to the road. There's a lot of companies, a lot of members that we represent at the chamber that don't believe they truly understand how the laws apply to their business models. And because of that, they don't really want to do business here because they don't want to accidentally break the law. So they're taking their business into other jurisdictions where they do have regulatory clarity. So that us competitiveness piece is really important. And more people are starting to understand that digital assets are a global market and it's important that the US is competitive globally. One piece just to back this up is that the CFTC Commodity Futures Trading Commission just announced their global markets advisory committee. And I've been appointed to that as well as a handful of other people from the crypto space. And the CFTC very much understands the global dynamics of the crypto markets and they're looking to the digital asset industry to engage with them to ensure we have laws that allow us businesses to grow, invest and develop blockchain activity in the United States. So that continues to be the big theme through all of this. But there's a lot of work to do to get the legal framework for us businesses to truly be able to build the rails for the."

And that is something that we have to continue the dialogue to understand to the powers of DC about why we have to continue moving forward in this space, and quickly as well, so regulation can be ironed out, so people can move forward and businesses can be built in America. Okay, I want to touch quickly a little bit about a tweet from the chief legal officer from Grayscale, Craig Salmis name. And he tweeted out, grayscale will soon file the next brief in our suit challenging SEC's decision to deny GBTC conversion to a spot bitcoin ETF. The case is moving swiftly while timing is uncertain. Oral arguments maybe as soon as Q two final decision in DC. Anything that I can have as a comment from you on that?"

        "text": "Yeah, absolutely. So we're following this case very closely. We signed on to an amicus brief in this case and encouraging the courts to move forward with bringing a spot bitcoin ETF to market. This particular case really shows the double speak at the SEC. On one hand you see comments from the chair and other people at the SEC saying it's essential that we protect consumer of investors, particularly retail investors. However, they have blocked every attempt over the past ten years to bring a spot bitcoin ETF to market and any other type of crypto ETF to market. So why is this so important for the retail investor? Well, if a retail. For retail investors, if they want to buy cryptocurrencies today, they cannot invest alongside of their financial advisors. With the support and advice of their financial advisors through their brokerage accounts, they have to leave their brokerage and go to crypto exchanges. Not that we have anything against crypto exchanges. We have amazing crypto exchanges in the US that are regulated, but there are trillions of dollars worth of investment money that's managed through brokerages. And many people are most comfortable investing with the advice and alongside their financial advisors. So it leaves people to navigate this space completely on their own. And as you know, there's many unique features to digital assets, like having to custody your own private keys. And if you don't know how to do that, you can make critical missteps that could lead to losing your entire investment. So it really has been a conundrum why the SEC will not allow crypto regulated products to come to market. And on top of that, the SEC has held bitcoin to a completely different standard than other existing commodity market ETF's. And we believe the SEC has not filed the administrative Procedures act in the way that they have handled bitcoin ETF. So that's why this has gone to the courts. And ultimately the courts are going to decide. And we believe that Grayscale has a strong case for these reasons."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. So the legality of these yield products is something that has been a debate amongst lawyers in the digital asset industry for many years. We have people on all sides. If you guys remember last year, Coinbase, which is a publicly listed digital asset exchange in the US, they proactively went to the SEC and asked the SEC for approval to bring a product like this to market, and the SEC said no. They were not very happy about that. They wrote a blog about it and it was all over the news for a couple of weeks. There's other companies who have offered yield products, who have moved to only offering these products to accredited investors to protect against this exact claim that these could be unregistered securities. Jim and I's position is that as a New York Department of Financial Services Trust company so regulated by the state of New York, that they are allowed to borrow client funds who opt in to such a program. So we may see some of these jurisdictional challenges between the states and the feds. Very similar debate that we're seeing with stable coins, right, where a lot of those stable coins are actually regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. And now you have members of Congress and the Fed that wants to preempt them and bring it all under the Fed's jurisdiction. And then the other piece is why now you mentioned Tylers tweet. You showed his tweet and im very sympathetic to what Tyler said. Over a year ago. The SEC told Coinbase, no, you cant do this. So if this is the SECs position, why have they gone so long in bringing in action? If they really felt that investors were at harm, why doing it today? So I think the timing assess that. It seems politically motivated by Chairman Gensler and now because of this action is going to make it even more difficult for those investors to be made whole. And then just the last thing, I've seen some headlines today saying that people are seeing evidence that in the blockfi settlement now that company is going into bankruptcy, that the SEC is going to be paid first. Remember, they had a settlement dollar settlement with the SEC last year in that the SEC is going to be paid first over retail investors. So if the SEC is really working to protect retail investors, why are they putting themselves first? That's my biggest question."

We're seeing that reflected in some of these employment actions, crypto.com being just one. We heard it from Coinbase as well. Look, I think it's interesting though, the language that you read there, there ongoing economic headwinds, that's the sort of language that you hear from traditional Wall street banks. It's often the language you hear before people are about to get laid off at big banks. So again, this is sort of a broad, secular movement happening in the space right now. Interestingly enough, the recent price action last few days seems to be defying, ignoring, pick the word of your choosing, this sort of general framework that we're seeing kind of creeping up in many different ways."

First thing I would say is that the digital asset industry, it's a nascent technology ecosystem, and so it is normal to see high volatility when you have a lot of startups. We are in a phase of experimentation. It is not clear what the future of this ecosystem is going to look like. The industry is literally rebuilding the way we transact across all asset classes. There's going to be a lot of winners. There's going to be a lot of losers. There's going to be a lot of experimentation, there's going to be successes, there are going to be failures. Years. And so we have gone through. This is my third crypto winner. So we will come out of this, we will learn from this. There will be companies that get stronger, who bring better, more relevant products to market. This is a part of being an innovative ecosystem, and it's important that people understand that going into it, knowing there's going to be very high highs and."

I do want to bring back something that you mentioned right at the beginning of the show where we talked about cbdcs is I mentioned that the UK government is going with it. They are moving ahead into the stablecoin space. And, well, actually, I didn't know that the US has, I didn't think that the US has made that decision on introducing a CBDC or not. Can you fill me in a little bit about that? For cbdcs in the US of 2023? Are they the answer for lawmakers in the US? So how is the US treating cbdcs in 2023?"

So he is the member of the House Financial Services committee who's going to chair that subcommittee on digital assets. Last year he sent a letter to the Department of Justice requesting an assessment on whether or not legislation is needed for government to issue a CBDC. There are many members of Congress, whose position is the Federal Reserve, does not have the authority to create a CBDC, which means Congress has to pass legislation to do so. That is an absolutely critical step that must happen in order for additional dollar to come to market. And we're still waiting for the DOJ's assessment on that. But we have seen lots of members, particularly Congressman Tom Emmer, be very vocal about you cannot move forward without us giving you the jurisdiction to do so. So while that kind of legality has been underway in Congress and with DOJ, the Fed has been moving forward with pilot programs. There's a number of experiments and pilot programs underway, particularly through the Reserve banks that are starting to experiment, do research, study, and really understand cbdcs. But I think we are many, many, many years away, and you've got this critical hurdle of getting that congressional authority to do so."

That proved to be true even for highly paid liquidators of Alameda research. You can see the headline there, the trading company founded by Spinous, according to data from Accram, cited by the bloc, Alameda liquidators lost 72,000 on DeFi lending platform Aave. This happened when the liquidators were trying to close the position. Unfortunately, they first removed the extra collateral use for the position that put them at risk of liquidation, which Akram says happened twice in nine days for are they wrapped? Bitcoins were lost in the process. Sum of $72,000. I'm going to bring in ash for this one. Ash, what do you make of this story?"

It's interesting, I guess, because it's basically saying, as you said, Elaine, I think quite rightly, that a highly paid liquidator who should be sophisticated in this sort of thing if they're going to be serving in a liquidator function, lost this. At the end of the day, it was for wrapped bitcoin. Not a huge amount of money. $72,000, obviously a huge amount of money for an individual, but not necessarily for a liquidator. Look, I think that the bigger overarching point that this story makes and the reason why we're talking about it today is that Defi is not intuitive. It's not the sort of thing that your mom, for most part, is going to want to use to get yield on something. It's just right now it's still in its infancy. Technology is extremely, extremely exciting, extremely promising. But as of today, there are definitely some user interface, user experience issues. Although you can see as you look at this technology, just where the future might hold and the power of decentralization. Elaine."

So from someone who is in the thick of DC, I really just want to ask you, after the whole FTX thing, what is the temperature like in DC at the moment to push forward crypto regulation after that whole debacle?"

There are many members of Congress that have taken big steps to distance themselves from the industry. There's members of Congress who are not taking meetings with crypto companies who don't want to come to crypto events. However, over the past couple of weeks, now that a couple of months has gone by. We're seeing that to kind of tone down a little bit again, as we've really reinstated some of those critical narratives. That SPF was obviously a bad actor. This was fraud. This wasn't a crypto crypto crime. This was fraud. And that no industry is immune from fraud. You see that in every industry. So it's definitely been a setback. It's definitely had policymakers, particularly members of Congress, want to distance themselves from this because of the bad pr around it. And then it's really given a lot of fire to the regulators to move forward with their regulation by enforcement."

This will be just a couple blocks from Capitol Hill. This is really crypto's day. It's really the industry to have their day in DC. So many times the narratives are shaped around this industry, and they come from an area of misunderstanding, fear, criticism, skepticism. So we are bringing in some of the top brand names in this space to talk about what they're doing that's actually benefiting people, investors, society, community, communities all around the world. And then we'll also talk about those policy discussions. And then the next day on that Wednesday, March 22, we're hosting Blockchain Education Day. It's been a couple of years since we've done this because Congress basically shut down. They weren't really allowing the public to go walk the halls of Congress, but we're inviting the entire industry to come to DC and meet with their elected representatives. So we're looking to have a large group of investors, crypto users, industry executives, industry people, join us to meet their member of Congress, tell them about what they're doing, tell them why this industry is important, and give members an opportunity to talk to their constituents so they really can understand what's happening back in their district. So we've got a big week planned that week. Everybody's invited. I hope real vision will be there, too. And you guys were partnered with us for that last year. And then the policymaking moves forward. We are in a little bit of a defensive posture, given the huge challenges we saw in 2022. But overall, we are very optimistic. We have significant champions throughout Washington. We doubled the size of the congressional blockchain caucus in the previous Congress. A lot more people understand this technology and have become active supporters. So we feel like we are in a good position despite these broader narratives that you're reading in the mainstream media."

And just the connection that you're making for anyone to come and join this event, that is something really cool. And I think actually a state that I think needs the crypto buzz. And DC is a very important, unique patch, of course, to have this going on. Now, as you know, in the world of crypto, it's all about community, it's all about dialogue. You know how interactive this show is. You know, we are live on Facebook Discord. So it is time for some viewer questions because the experts that we bring on, it's not easy. It might seem easy clicking on YouTube. We have to correlate these experts and to match up with the time for this show. So I'm going to jump in straight into some viewers questions and I'm going to bring Ash and Perrianne. And you can put your hands up first, who can take this on? So the first question comes from Jay Radway in our discord, our 5000 pro crypto plus members, the smartest bunch in the space. And he is asking more bad news. But bitcoin is rising. What world are we living in? Has crypto released all the black swans yet? Ash, you want to go that? You want to take a bus?"

We see obviously some challenges with DCG, obviously some challenges with finance as well, in terms of the news headlines. So, you know, this, this question about where the rising risks are versus the price action, I think is an important one. Have all the black swans been released? I think the definition of the Black Swan is that you don't know if it's been released. So I would say always, obviously, look to think about what could go wrong in a space. It's an important thing, particularly if you're thinking on a shorter term basis. Elaine."

So Jhia 139 on YouTube is asking, do you think the acceptance of policymakers to bring a light touch approach to crypto, similar to the beginning of the Internet era, is because crypto is situated closer to monetary policy."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that's absolutely a factor. At the end of the day, digital assets are a paradigm shift in the financial and monetary system. The technical leap of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was it solved the double spend problem that that Internet entrepreneurs and pioneers had spent decades to try to solve. So thanks to bitcoin, we can now send financial transactions peer to peer online without the use of an intermediary. And there's a lot of middlemen and intermediaries that are going to be disrupted. Those intermediaries, many of them are very powerful, and they've got armies of people lobbying on their behalf. So at the end of the day, this is superior technology to the current rails we use in the financial system. So I'm very confident this is where the future is. But we've got a lot of battles, and we're seeing those play out in real time."

The promise of decentralization, the promise of technology to do things faster and cheaper and with greater functionality than we've ever seen before. That's why I'm so passionate about this space. That's why I'm here. But let's flip the script and talk about the opposite side of the equation. And the question specifically, is this because it's close to monetary policy? I think, as Perian said, that's one of the factors. It certainly is close to monetary policy. And if central banks lose the ability to control the levers of essentially being able to moderate interest rates and employment growth, obviously that's something that's critical to nation states. But the reality is that this cuts close to a lot of very critical things in terms of the role of government. And there will be pushback and there will be challenges, and it won't be a smooth, kind of even ascent up to utopia. There are going to be these challenges in the space.

So there was the Lummis Gillibrand bill, the Financial Innovation act that was introduced last Congress. I think that's going to get reintroduced and make more progress this Congress. There was also the DCCPA. This was the Ag committee's bill, the Digital Commodity Consumer Protection Act. I think we will see that reemerge. And then I actually think we're going to see new market infrastructure bills come forward. And then also that enforcement.
