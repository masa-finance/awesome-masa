I'm curious how, you know, sandbox reaction is just because everyone's been putting a lot of, you know, hope and faith in their sandbox plot. Now they got their own land. Very interesting dynamics there. You know, in general, I think the token is going to be, is going to be pretty big, but I just. It's been, everything's with bored apes has been so hyped up that, you know, can it meet that, that expectation? Totally. So that's. That's where we'll have to see. But, yeah, it's just crazy.

I have, like, I only have six days or four days. I have four days to lose, like 40 pounds because I tried to make my guy as realistic as I could to me, and I ended up with the fat one.

Super bullish. Yeah. And I'm, I don't know if. I don't know how I feel about that at this point for nfts because, you know, the the narrative was price goes down, nfts go up.

And I'm like, eth must be up. So I checked ETH and sure enough, it was up. You know, it was like $2,700 or something like that. I'm like, okay, that makes sense. So I think in the short term, you know, the first couple of days. But what's it like if. I mean, if ETH pumps continuously dollar 200 every day for the next two weeks, we're not going to see much traffic or much traction in nfts. But if it pumps and then holds, pumps a little bit, holds again, you know, for. For say, a week between pumps or even three, four days, that that might not necessarily be too bad for nfts."

And if you're earning EtH and staking frac, then you can also vote in the DAO and vote to change the marketplace fees, vote to fund different proposals. And so one really good way to describe it to kind of like TLDR everything that I just said is it's kind of like fractional art, except it's got like a looksrare tokenomics.

So it correct me if I'm wrong, somebody can actually come on and mint something directly to fractal or on the marketplace as well as import something to an existing NFT. So for example, a bored ape, so you could either say you were x copy and he wanted to put a hundred, you know, do his next drop via fractionalizing one of his pieces. You could do that. Or say you're, say you're des and you have 50 board apes and you want to fractionalize one of them to get some liquidity, you could do both of those things, correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, exactly. Just like if you were going to list on opensea, you can just fractionalize it first and then you can list as many of the fractions as you wish or as few as you wish. So it fractionalizes all these nfts into 10,000 pieces."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, so you can set the price and if someone else buys from you, they can also set a price. So we're working on, we're actually just like taking some last minute looks at our UI as it's live right now, but not open because, right, because we're dropping here in like less than a, less than, let's like 12 hours or something like that. But, or 18 maybe. Yeah, but anyways, we're looking at this right now, but it's just to make sure it all looks good. But, yeah, so like say you list, say you've got your 10,000 fractions of your ape, you want to list, you get one list. So you can list any number for any price and all your fractions will be, will be listed for the same price. So you can list one batch of a thousand fractions for 0.01 apiece and then that's obviously way under price for like an eight fraction. But I'm just keeping it round for the example. Somebody else could buy all those 1000 fractions from you. So that'd be what? Like one ETH for the 1000 or something like that? Ten eth maybe. And then they, they undercut you or something. Or they could list higher. It's the same NFT, but yeah, you'll see like different listings at different prices and it just turns into like a really free market, like really quickly."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. So the selling mechanism would be. It's pretty much once you start, once these fractions start flying around, it's going to be nearly impossible for somebody to go and actually buy them all back up off the free market. Right. If you were to do so, say you reassembled all 10,000 fractions. It's just basically like a very easy swap. Like if you've got all 10,000 in your wallet, you take it, you can redeem the full, the whole NFT. What's really much more likely to happen, I think what you're asking about is like the, the buyout. And so the buyout is like, you three own an NFT that's, you know, you all own between the two, the three of you, the 10,000 fractions. So I bring an offer to the table and I just say, like I'm going to offer ten eth on all these fractions or, you know, for the total NFT. And then every fraction holder, it takes a few days. It's like a five day process there. The fraction holders are given an opportunity to vote yes or no. If 80% of the fraction holders agree to sell the NFT, then the NFT will be sold and everyone will just get their payout automatically."

        "text": "Okay, so that's super interesting. It's very similar to like des have you. That explanation makes me think of things like collectible or rally road that we've seen, you know, kind of with IRL assets like, you know, sports cards or I, you know, muscle cars and things like that, where, you know, somebody comes in and does they sell a fraction or all of their asset? Right. So say maybe somebody has, you know, the Michael Jordan rookie card, PSA ten, that goes for like 250 grand. They don't want to lose the asset, but they want some liquidity. So they decide to sell half of it in fractionalized shares of the community comes in and buys. There's an open market to buy, sell and trade them. And then if, say, Chamber wails out and he wants this Michael Jordan rookie card because he loves Michael Jordan and he is such a burn. He loves Michael Jordan so much and he comes and says, all right, I'll give you 350,000 for the Michael Jordan card. Then the buyout offer goes to the community and it has to pass by, in this case, 80% majority. And then that would be. Everybody would make their money on that. Did I, did I summarize that correctly?"

And the other thing I think is cool here, Des, is that, you know, we've seen with like fractional dot art and things like that, when you fractionalize, they basically create you an ERC 20 token. And that's not what happens here. You're actually getting created in an NFT. Is that. That's correct."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. So I like that a lot better than an ERC 20 token, personally, because I think one of the problems that we see when we have, like, you know, these daosh, like, let's say ape dow, for example, right? And you've got this underlying asset value of their treasury and it's going crazy up in price, but nobody's trading the ERC 20 token, and the price of the token doesn't follow the price of the asset. Right. And so it's also, it's hard for you to get in that situation, liquidity for what the value of the treasury is worth. Where in this case, say, I had one of those NFTs that represented the fraction, I could go calculate what's in the treasury at that exact value. At that moment, I want out and list my NFT for that price and somebody can come and buy in for that. And so I think there's a lot better options for a Dow member or something like that to have liquidity in that sense. Was that what the thought process was there? Burn pile? Because I see that huge opportunity there."

Because, let's be real, a lot of people are lazy in this space. Even in five days, they're not going to go in and vote. So I guess is it 80% of the vote or 80% of the outstanding shares?"

We thought about this a lot and we put in, we feel like the right failsafes because it was like, okay, well, if you needed 80% to vote, then somebody, I could sell you 10%. And then to trigger the buyback, I could, like, wash, trade myself and buy it back lower. And I hold 80% of the shares. So I would just approve that.

Like, you could come in there and there's probably some arbitrage opportunities to, to be had as well.

So we want to be, you know, our tagline like, that, you'll see on the website is, like, the utility layer for nfts. And so we think that this has, like, a lot more applications than just a marketplace and. Yeah, so I think, like, it's just always nice to, like, keep that in mind.

Is the fractional ownership is, sorry, is it a fractional ownership marketplace only or is there, is it a normal marketplace as well? Meaning, can you list things on this marketplace that are not fraction."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I guess it's 08:00 a.m. eastern time tomorrow. You can find us at fractal IO. And then just click on marketplace. Go ahead and claim your airdrop by listing something. If you, you know, if you, if you're not a big nft holder, you know, say that you don't have anything to list over, even two eth or whatever, and you're not interested in like listing something super fractionally, but you want to claim your airdrop. My advice to you is just fractionalize something in your wallet and list all 10,000 fractions and that'll just like kind of keep it whole and then you'll, you'll be able to redeem for the full NFT later if no one buys it or whatever. And yeah, just play around with it. Let's, I'm just like super excited to see what happens because this whole thing is just like kind of permissionless and just given to the community. So I'm excited to see, like, how people use it."

Go use fractal, fractionalize something and claim your airdrop tomorrow. That'll be fun. Looking forward to it. Other than that, Des chamber, any last words here?"

If, you know, if you didn't have anything at the two eth level, is that kind of where you recommend people start? As far as fractionalizing is kind of like a two? Is it worth really fractionalizing a 0.25 nft or a 0.5 nft?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I think so. Like, if I was like, what's, what's so zero one times 10,000 is. That's a hundred eth."

        "speaker": "B",
