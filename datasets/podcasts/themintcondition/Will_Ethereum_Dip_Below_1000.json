The moon hearing this. Or it's like we've seen things with Sotheby's and Christie's and things like that. But, you know, those are auctions and this is, you know, making a pretty bold statement to sell off, you know, traditional art. They're, they're going reverse. They were auctioning off traditional art pieces to go and scoop up, you know, some of this digital art revolution that we're all part of. Steve wants to know how long before the moma gets rugged. MoMA's gonna go sign a bad transaction and get millions of x copies stolen from them. Well, you know, the moMA could actually just go recreate those x copies themselves now because they're all CCO, so maybe they shouldn't buy x copies. But we'll see. But yeah, I mean, that's awesome.

There's like a thousand of them. They were kind of pumping the other day. They are called like the West 1 second. I'll get you the proper name for them. But they're unrevealed coffins at the moment. Thunder Valley, that's what they're called. There's only a thousand of them. They seem to be, you know, I think I bought the top of the unrevealed.

In other news, Roman has been arrested and alpha afternoons will no longer be on the network. But, yeah, so the, the Stoics was a project by Gabe. This has been a very fun experience. So first, if you haven't, if you don't know what I just held up, he was at the conferences and he was hand drawing these, one of ones on his kind of stoic posters here. Right. Hyping up his, his mint. Right. But the idea was if you had one of these, you were auto allow listed, which was very cool. And then if you held any of his other pieces, you were allowed as well. So the mint happened a week or so ago, I think, and they just started revealing yesterday. But I thought what he did was a very, very cool way to do these reveals. So at first he revealed all the art. Right. And no, no traits as far as, like, what was rare and what was it. Right. So he, so people were buying and selling on the secondary, just based on the aesthetics, what they liked, which I thought was very cool. And then last night, they put out a thread on, like, what the different types of kind of characters or archetypes are in the art. And you kind of got a little bit of a picture of what was, you know, maybe more rare than others. And then throughout the day today, they've been doing a slow drip of traits kind of that are now showing in the metadata on what is more rare than others, which is very interesting. And I was very, very lucky, and I pulled a one of one out of the collection, which is this right here."

So, like, if you're in the Rainmaker tier, which I am not, unfortunately, but you can see. Where am I looking here? Web three week three promo. You've got a crypto punk for first place in this process. And then you've got a board ape as first place in the Rainmaker tiers. Right now, there's 17 people in this contest for the ape. There's 19 people in the contest for the crypto punk. And so, like, when I'm thinking about, like, where to play my lineups this week, and so I have some legendary lineups that I can play, and we've got. So when you tear down the legendary.
