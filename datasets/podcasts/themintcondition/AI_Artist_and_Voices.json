Like, we used to go to national sales meetings, and you'd stay up all night and you'd get to the meeting room at 07:00 a.m. and Jim Cook's got a Boston lager under every chair in the room at 07:00 a.m. and, like, no joke, that's how it was. And, like, you would do these, like, team breakouts, and they would just wheel in just beers and beers and beers. Just. It was crazy. But I do want to. I think this is a good topic to kick over because I wanted to start today with Mackie, if he's available, and I wanted to get two takes from Mackey.

It was well known amongst the bar room staff to be the most rancid smelling day of the year because the whole tap room was just smelling like a big, fat fart. And that is what craft beer does to your insides. But on E. Denver, on ethnor. Oh, it's so gross. Yeah, I can't do it anymore.

Maybe it's one week, and then it's three days of the actual main event convention. And let's see. I met James on Wednesday. We went to lunch. We went to the building part of the venue, because the main venue wasn't open yet. Got my pass early, which was apparently a very good idea because I got lots of group messages saying that everyone was standing in line. I did not get to meet Adam. Let's see. I got to meet consider chaos and brit. And I don't know Dave's handle, but he has a 3d invisible friend. I know that much. Who else did I hang out with? I can't remember. I ended up spending. I had this weird dichotomy about the whole thing where I was going with Burrito Dow. That was the intention, which is this artist collective that I'm part of, and they're all young and Gen Z people, and they're all too cool to go to a convention. So none of them went to that and then spreading it with meeting with Djen people. And also my girlfriend attended, and she has friends in Denver, but she wasn't at the conference. So balancing all three of those things. Pretty chaotic, I'll say. But let's see. I saw Betty walk by. I got interviewed by a woman who tried to sit on my lap for a little while. That was weird. I played a worldwide web game. I got to see one of my friends, Ibrahim, speak. God, it was chaos. The first day that I was there was just absolute overwhelming overstimulation."

It was all LinkedIn or Telegram and, like, one, if I looked them up on Twitter, they had, like, maybe 300 followers, but they're, like, the shit that they are building. Everyone in Twitter who participates in crypto or NFTs is probably going to use at some point. So, like, they just don't really give a shit about the Twitter drama. They just want to build cool shit that they're passionate about and, like, the. The sense of collaboration amongst people, even if they have, like, products, like, in the same vertical that are competing against each other, they still want to collaborate because they want to get better. They want to see other people win. So it was just a very, like, positive experience that I was psyched about and had me incredibly bullish on, you know, this industry for many, many years to come."

Like, you could insert your blogs or your transcripts of podcasts or, like, your journal entries or things like that, and it would essentially, like, kind of get to know you and be able to kind of answer questions as you. And then I was listening to how he uses it, and this blew my mind. He basically was taking it and creating a chatbot, like, chat gp three, and he was using it to, like, self analyze his mental health. And it was like, hey, pretend you're a therapist. What are these last, what are the three things you'd work on over the last, based on the last 30 days of journal entries? And it was like giving him almost a therapy session. I was like, holy crap, this is wild, what people are going to do with this stuff. And then, secondly, based on what you just said about, like, you know, replicating your voice and everything, I said to my wife last night, I was like, we're going to need, like, a family, like, safe word, because there's gonna be these deep, fake voice models that, you know, my kid could be somewhere and he can get a call from somebody that's using my voice. It's out there publicly replicated, and, you know, put him in danger or be scammed or my family or whatever. And, like, you're gonna need stuff like that in the future.

I'm more worried about, like, I remember a crypto punk early on. This is like, probably when apes were, like, still like an ETH being like, oh, you apes getting all mad at us. I loved you. Little seed phrase sharing adorable little fellas. And, like, it's like the idea that, like, people who are in the Yugi ecosystem are going after this thing when you can burn it in gas is, like, probably the scary part to me. Um, but I will say I'm kind of shocked at the price action. I thought one to two bitcoin was going to be the bottom bid. And I know we're getting close to there, but I'm just kind of surprised because what they're saying is that this sort of art, which they're trying to make, sort of like the autoglyphs or, you know, fidendas of bitcoin, uh, ordinals are going for less than a mutant at the low end. And that is kind of surprising to me. I know it's not a utility access pass, but curious your thoughts on, like, I know, like, I mean, I know chambers going to fud it, but I mean, like, bunch, like, as far as, like, maybe a better, you know, kind of guess of like, the idea of this being a long term art piece. Like, I don't know, I think there's kind of something there to these. And that's why I'm surprised. Are you surprised it's not even to a bitcoin at the low end?"

And so I think there could be, maybe what we expected was that there would be a lot of either Eth Yuga collectors that were super interested in this that would go over, or that Yuga kind of had enough clout in the crypto world to be attractive to some bitcoin folks. And I think what you're probably seeing is, like, the Venn diagram is actually really small of bitcoiners that give a shit versus Eth yugamaxis with enough funds to go and bid on something like this. So I think there's this really interesting kind of very, very small Venn diagram. And it's like, is. I mean, is the general sentiment of bitcoin folks that they don't want inscriptions on bitcoin, and so they're not interested. And then the group is just so small that, hey. And they also don't give a shit about Yuga, right? And like, you see the creator of Ordinal's protocol, like, very publicly kind of going after Yuga for. For this. And I think it's interesting to see even that. Right? And I think his specific gripe was the way they're doing the auction, which the irony is not lost on me at all, that people are trading these on Google sheets and he's out there kind of knocking them for the way they're doing this auction.

And I get what people are saying with, like, we're playing on their turf or anything, which, by the way, I still stand by my Sam dye, that us in our stupid animal jPeg should go invade bitcoin and, like, ruin their parties in their neighborhoods. But I'll say this like, I guess. Let me ask it differently. Let's say the bottom end goes for $20,000. Let's say the resting price ends now at $20,000. And one person buys for 20,001, person buys for 90,000 or whatever it is, the top end and everything else in between. Do you think one of these is eventually going to resale in, like, the next 1235 years for more or less than $20,000? Because I guess my feeling is, like. I guess it depends on a lot of factors, but if I was gunned in my head, I'd say significantly more than $20,000 based on 300 supply. Yuga's first ordinal collection. It's an art piece. It's an artist. Like, I just. That's why I guess what throws me off is I feel like this seems relatively clear that unless ordinals really don't become a thing at all.

Because of all the things we're talking about, there's a barrier to bidding and auctioning. There's this uncertainty about the tech. And, like, if you just kind of follow the yuga breadcrumbs of, like, where they. And just the history of the demand that they have, I think you're. I think you're right, and it's. But, you know, it's not a degen flip type of thing. So it's. You've got to have a certain level of conviction, you've got to have a certain level of patience, you've got to have a certain level of liquidity to have the confidence to kind of drop a bitcoin or two or more on something like this. But I would say as long as ordinals stay around, I think this is a value at the low end, right? Like 100,000, who knows? But I think at the low end, it's probably a tremendous value. Yeah."

Just come time this next year, I guarantee I'm gonna be right there in the loop with you. You know, that's my home, girl. Dude, that's incredible."

        "text": "So let me ask you a quick question. So, you know, coming from having been doing this then for two plus years, what are you. Are you surprised at like, the, I guess, take off the rise of this? Is it something that you kind of started as just for fun and really wasn't sure if it would be kind of an accepted art form and, like, where do your opinions stand now?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "I",
        "text": "And see, I have a weird weird thing with that. Like, I started off as a photographer and NFT community, you know, then got into ganner for, like, just everybody on clubhouse when my friends are doing it. And then I kind of took. And then I tried to start my own collection with it, and, like, any fizzled out, like, never happened because of Polygon. Was a freaking mess back then. I got a dude on polygon that was dumb. And I just kind of, like, walked away from the whole AI art thing and started getting back in my photography again. And then I saw this resurgence come back, like, this last, like, this, like, maybe, like, maybe six months ago. And, you know, six months ago, the conversation was like, is AI even art? And now we're. Now. Now Claire's in the. In the Louvre. So I think that, like, it's. It's. I'm not surprised at all, honestly. Like, I'm just. I am surprised at how fast the technology is moving. I mean, my opinion is that, like, unless you're keeping all your seed. Your. Your seed numbers, which is, like, the one thing that makes the art the arthem, it's like, that's. That's those numbers. Compile the art that's creating with it. So you can, like, do the same prompt of the same seed, if you know how to do that, and you'll get something 99.9% similar to what you got, but the same exact prompt. But if you're not keeping your seeds and you're not running it that way, you're literally creating one on one art. In a sense. In a sense, not completely, but, like, it's kicking out. Like, and the technology is moving so fast and improving so quickly. It's hard pressed to not call this stuff valuable one to one art, because the stuff that I was creating three months ago was like, it's not embarrassing, and I'm not ashamed of it. I'm like, jesus. You know what I mean?"

        "text": "I feel that. No, I totally get it. Funny. I just started doing this myself in. It was about two months ago, and I looked today at, like, what my very first output was versus what I was making this morning, and it's just. It's so wild, like, how fast you can learn to use these tools and just create very, very, very cool things. And so I'm super excited for you to kind of be back in the game. Super excited for claire to be in the dang Louvre. That's super cool."

        "text": "Totally. I mean, which, you know, like, like you said six months ago, you wouldn't have ever even thought that would be possible. And I think, you know, it kind of ties back into the ordinal conversation a little bit, Steve, where, like, you know, six months ago, people were having this conversation about AI, and is AI even art? And, like, we're sitting here talking now, and, like, where will ordinals be in here? And I think, like, nothing is off the table and nothing's impossible to think of there as far as."

I just think this whole space is just, you know, that's what's so exciting to me, is just how fast things move and evolve and, like, we really are on the bleeding edge of all this stuff. And, you know, I've never felt more like being early is such an advantage and an edge and, like, it doesn't matter what you're early to just, like, keep trying and testing and playing and being involved in learning, because some one of these things is going to hit right, and you, like, the world is going to be playing catch up to web three, to AI and all this stuff. And we're here talking about it now, which is pretty darn cool. So appreciate you, chaz, and chamber. Des, let's shut this thing down. Des, any final words here that. I'll take that as a no. Chamber."

And you create a collection on makersplace for the manifold makers place exhibition thing, because you can import your own manifold contracts. And over there, and they took community vote of top ten. I ended up in there, and I already got a bid by this legendary collector. Dude, I just found. I just saw it. Just a second."

Appreciate you. Thanks to everybody who came and hang out today with us. We'll be back here on this show on Wednesday at four or five eastern. Otherwise, check out the night shift tonight at 11:00 p.m. for episode 99. Until next time, stay mint it."
