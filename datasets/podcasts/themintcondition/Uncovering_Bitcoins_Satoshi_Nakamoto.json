Satoshi Nakamoto's earliest collaborator, Marty Sirus Malmi, just released their entire email history at 120 pages. It's the most significant addition to the archives of bitcoin's unknown inventor. And then he goes through and puts the most important new findings, which I thought were pretty interesting. So you've got here just some highlights. When asked how bitcoin might scale in the future, Satoshi theorized the network would have a maximum of around 100,000 nodes. And then you see the snippet and he goes into the calculation of the economics of the network at that scale. And there's about 50,000 nodes running the software today. Satoshi believed that bitcoin mining would be less energy intensive than the legacy banking system. He's got a good new quote in here. I'll read it. I'll truncate it. If it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would still be less wasteful than the labor and resource intensive convention conventional banking activity. It would replace. The cost would be an order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that pay for all those brick and mortar buildings, skyscrapers and junk mail credit card offers. Satoshi. There you go."

Satoshi foresaw at least one viable non monetary use for bitcoin. And that is, you know, like on chain time stamping. Satoshi described the differences in bitcoin and digicash, which was David Choms, failed emoney. This is notable as Chama worked on or had a profound impact on the cypherpunks, including Hal Finney.

I don't remember everything entirely, to be perfectly frank, but I do remember I was already drunk. I was running around. Goody grabs me, goes, do you want to meet big boy and take a photo and write to bit boyfriend? I go, I don't take photos with scumbags. And just kept moving.

So this was cool. This one's cool. Throw this one up, Riggs. Might like this throw up two in the nest there that I think are cool. The, we were talking last week about the Gemini 1.5 and like, what that million token context window might lead to. And I think one of the things that we did not cover that also is super interesting from the Gemini perspective is that it's multimodal and accepts video input, which chat, GPT and OpenAI does not do yet. And the demos that I've seen with people using the video feature is crazy. Like, so I put two examples up that just kind of blew my mind. One is definitely, one's a novelty ish type of thing, but very useful. And the other one is just like, oh, I can't believe this is possible. The first is a tweet from McKay Wrigley. If you don't follow McKay Wrigley and you're into AI and seeing a bunch of cool experiments, definitely give him a follow. Super cool. But he says he recorded himself lifting weights. He fed the video to Gemini 1.5 pro and asked it to write JSON for each exercise's name, set, count, rep, count weight, and generate form critiques. It worked perfectly. Said to hook it up to a camera and text to speech. And you have an AI personal trainer. How crazy is that?"

And it's so obvious when you actually read it, you're like, oh, of course it can do that. But to see it in, like, in a demo is wild. Where. So this person, Petrono says, watch Gemini 1.5 pro collect. Oh, no, this isn't the one I was looking at, but this was cool too. He collected all his tweets from a video where he just scrolled through his feed and organized them into JSON format. And, oh, yeah, no, this was it. And so he, it basically turned it into a scraper. And then I saw another demo where the person recorded themselves using, just using their computer screen. So just like, hey, interacting with a website. So let's just say you're going to a website where you're going to buy groceries."

So, like, think about that in terms of, like, data collection or web scraping or anything like that. I mean, you don't need to know how to code to do any of this stuff anymore. And it's pretty friggin nuts. Like, I mean, the use cases of, like, video to understanding and unpackaging that to code or anything else is just insane to think about.
