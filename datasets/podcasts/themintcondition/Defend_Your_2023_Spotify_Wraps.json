        "text": "Yeah. So for the last couple of years now, I feel like two, three, maybe even four years. Spotify, around this time of year, end of November, beginning of December, releases your own personal year in review. It's called Spotify wraps. And what it does is it calculates all the data, tells you a lot about the types of music you're listening to, who you were listening to, your favorite. Your top five favorite artists, your top five favorite songs, you know, the style of music you were listening to, and the amount of minutes you were listening. So it was. And it's fun. I think last year, we did the same thing, too, or at least we talked about it a little bit. And I do think it's a fun. I think Spotify gets that. Right. Where we were talking about Apple versus Apple podcasts, I think the wraps are a phenomenal idea, and this is probably their. They probably get ten to 20 times more social media presence during, like, this week with these raps. So they've even gotten. We were talking about earlier, big. Big names are coming out and doing, like, little videos thanking people. So if you, you know, if you listen to Taylor Swift, there was, like, a Taylor Swift video of her just thanking everybody for listening. I got a Paul McCartney one. I got. What else I got? I got a Jimmy world one that felt personal. I felt like he was talking to me. I feel like there was only, like, four of us that had Jimmy world in their rotation. So it's a cool way to really just see what everybody's listening to through the year, what effects, what they're listening to. So I don't know if it was last year or the year before you were yours had a lot of kids songs on there, so obviously, you know, new kids kind of dictates the, you know, what's being listened to. Payne has some excuse for what his list turned out to be. I'm suspicious of his excuses already, but, yeah, so it's. It's pretty cool."

Should be there now. My top artist this year, much to Anthony's chagrin, was the Beatles number one, number one overall pick. He was talking a lot of shit about people not listening to him.

It's hard to find great american bands. V squared in the chat. Tyler Childress is the shit. So I. Thanks, v squared. I agree. He is fantastic. I'm going to see him this summer. He's coming to my hometown and I'm super excited for it. But yes, the killers. Just a catalog of phenomenal music. Great live bangers upon bangers upon bangers. The killers greatest rock band greater than the Foo fight get. I have trouble getting another american band. Like, you know, a lot of people say Foo fighters, which I laugh at. I don't think that's the case at all. I think the Foo Fighters are just american U two. And it's true. Like. Like a big, huge band that everybody loves that's had maybe one good album.

My top artist ended up being Fred again because I got super heavy with his song me heavy. And I listened to it like, I am a repeat person because it helps me focus. So I will listen to something on repeat. To me, music is like, I hear it. If there's a good melody vibe, that's like the first date, then I'll go on a second date, which happens, like, maybe four repeats later, where I'll put the lyrics up and I'll actually, like, digest the words, and then I'll be like, okay, if I'm in the words and I already like the melody, then we can have a relationship. And so repeat will happen for, like, days, maybe two or three days, and then it'll be in my mind and in my head forever. And I'll also remember the lyrics probably forever because I have, like, developed that relationship with it. Sorry. It just snowed here and it's super slippery. And everyone seems to. To be, like, not having their winter tires on. Welcome to Canada. Okay, so if I cut out, it's not a good thing. I'm not driving. And divide also says yes to virtual insanity. Fucking awesome song. Banger. Okay. And also a bit of a metaphor, I think, and a thesis for this whole entire experience of web three. Virtual insanity. I like that."

That I put, that is my second one is called Azir. And I really like. He sings in English, but he has other music as well. And then Kid koala is incredible. He is like an old school vinyl dj that does, like, a lot of that. But he has these albums called music to draw to. And the first one is also incredible for focus. The knife is an OG experimental kind of band that is just wild and feral, and I love them. And then Donna Misty has this song called to me, your face is love, which is like an electronica track that I really liked, so. So, yeah, that's. That was me.
