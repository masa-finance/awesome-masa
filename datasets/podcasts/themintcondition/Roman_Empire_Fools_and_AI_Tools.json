I had a paper route. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was working early. I've always been a doer, I guess. So. I had a paper route in fifth grade, and what I used to do, when I would get the papers, they would actually, like, just deliver the whole bunch to my house. I would have to roll them and, like, either put them in the plastic bags or rubber band them, and then I would deliver them around my neighborhood most of the time on rollerblades, which is just a great site. Yeah, I used to deliver papers on rollerblades, but what I used to do was open the trunk, like, the hatchback of my mom's car. We had an suv or something. So just open the trunk of the car, and I would roll all the papers and throw them back there. And what I would do was listen to music blaring loud in the garage. And I used to blast that song. I used to play that fucking song while I was rolling newspapers in my parents garage. So that's the flashback."

Yeah, amazing. Amazing. And getting paid minimum wage, like, at the time was a big deal. And, I mean, when you're like 14, you don't spend money. So it was just like, accumulating in my bank account. And, you know, after a year, you have like a couple thousand dollars, you know what I mean, from working part time. It's pretty. It was pretty great back then. Now I spend a $1,000.

However, I. I also want to hear now what people's first jobs were. So we're going to do, um, we're going to do either one of those that people could, uh, jump in the chat and let us know and give us a comment. But before we do that, don't forget it is Friday, so we've got a load of content for you over the weekend. Tonight, 11:00 p.m. eastern, we have the night shift on YouTube and Twitter. Uh, Saturday, we have Saturday morning cartoon at 10:30 a.m. followed by Degen bets on Sunday at 10:00 a.m. to about 1130 noon. And then coffee with captain following back on Monday morning. Give us a like and a retweet down there. Help us get this show out there. Nobody wants to hear us now that we're not called the condition anymore. So any help would be appreciated. Subscribe, like, rate review, all of those things. We are a podcast that goes out audio wise as well, so any reviews would be appreciated. And, you know, tell a friend who's in a mid life crisis."

If you missed today's coffee with captain, I would. And this story interests you? Go back and listen. They had the, they had somebody from proof of play on this morning to talk about their raise. But the company proof of play got a $33 million investment by a 16 z. So they are the team behind Steve's favorite game, Pirate Nation. And they had a full, full interview this morning. So if that interests you to hear more about, I would recommend taking a listen to coffee with captain and then back into the AI streets. Two interesting articles here. Chamber. We've got one. Let's see one here from Venturebeat. And the headline here is Amazon leader says the new gen AI, Alexa, is a super agent. That's interesting. So Amazon unveiled a major upgrade to Alexa's underlying AI, which they're calling a breakthrough. And their chief scientist says it's as significant as when Alexa was first introduced the new AI. Powering Alexa is a large language model that allows Alexa to have more natural conversations and be helpful in more context by connecting to real world knowledge. Says it contrasts their approach with chat bots like chat GPT, saying Alexa is focused on utility and doing real things versus generating text conversations. Shots fired. Privacy and trust are important considerations with smart home devices like Alexa. And Amazon claims they've been transparent about data collection and want to ensure customers are comfortable and always being listened to. Even if you think you're not, you definitely are, says chief scientist. He didn't say that, I just said that. There are interesting philosophical questions about how human like, we want smart assistants to become and whether people may forget Alexa is AI. Oh, that'll be interesting. Amazon says Alexa should remind people that it's AI. And then overall, you know, this presents a major advancement in Alexa capabilities through these modern LLMs. So it sounds like this new Alexa is going to be able to actually execute agent like tasks for you. Chamber. Would you have an Alexa agent in your house? Do you have an Alexa already?"

Like, you'd be asking something for chat GPT and it might be able to do shit for you. Like, maybe it can do work for you. Who knows? But. All right, anyway, all right, one more here. YouTube to add AI creator tools to find music for videos and add dubs. So YouTube is expanding its creator music feature with new AI capabilities to make finding music easier for creators. I think this is interesting because chamber. We've been blocked from posting videos on YouTube sometimes because chumbawambo music that we've chosen to use. Yeah, right.

That came out in 1990 as a song to highlight your video. Like it's the perfect song for your video and it tells you like, oh, I don't know how licensing works, but it gives you a number and you feel comfortable with whatever that price is.

I need comments on this one, because this whole way that this thing transpired for me the other day was just kind of really insane. I didn't understand it, but. So I'm in this group chat of this fantasy football league that I'm in. There's, like, 20 people in the group chat. I often have it on mute. I'm a co owner, so it's not like my immediate friends. I'm kind of like, you know, in the group by association because I'm co managing this team with a buddy. But we're in this chat the other day, and so I very rarely, like, check in on it, but sometimes I do, or I'll go in there, just, like, clear the notifications or whatever, and I jump in this chat, and they're having this conversation. And the question that the guy asked the group was, hey, how often do you think about the Roman Empire? I thought that was such a. I thought it was a weird question, and so not, like, the answers that I got back or that the guy got back were not, like, answering how often they actually think about the roman empire. But a few of them responded, oh, my God. My wife just asked me this. My girlfriend just asked me this. I just got asked this yesterday. I don't understand. And then the dude that originally answered the or asked the question dropped this article from Forbes that said, like, women are asking men how, how often they think of the Roman Empire. And the answer is quite a lot. And for me, I was very curious at, like, because nobody was giving an actual answer. They just were surprised that they were all being asked the same question. And now coming to the realization that, you know, this is a thing, so what I, what did I do? I took the question to another group chat. I said, and I was like, hey, guys, how often do you think of the Roman Empire? And thinking that, like, in this group chat, I knew somebody would, would have a actual answer. The first person was like, I think about the roman empire daily. I actually just finished a ten hour podcast series on the Roman Empire. Okay, mind blown. The next response was, I'm more of a norse norse mythology guy myself. Okay, I know I got it, though. I got it right. But so, like this, those are the two that I absolutely would have pegged. Think about the roman empire or something like it. The rest of them, I was like, one guy was probably a medium. The other guy, I felt probably never thought about it. So I power ranked them and I was correct. But I don't know the last time I saw about the Roman Empire. And so I, I'm like, I got to see what this is all about. And apparently it's a TikTok trend. And, yeah, people are, and I am kind of shocked at how often men are responding that they think of the Roman Empire. And this led into a conversation about, I'm going to try to find this verbatim from the texts that I got about this. The guy, the norse mythology guy, he, he responded, I posted the, I posted the article and he goes, my wife just asked me this yesterday and it caused a fight. And, and I said, why? And he goes, she asked me. And I gave basically the same mythology answer. I just. That I just said. But then it turned into her trying to have a pity party about not being smart. So I tried to defend her and define being smart as something outside of just thinking about the Roman Empire. And then she, well, actually me. And said, I described what I described were interpersonal skills. And I said, forget it. I tried. I don't care if you're smart or stupid, but you are annoying, which is just an excellent line. But then, but when I read this to my wife and she's like, well, I think people who think about the roman empire probably are smart. And I was like, does that mean people who don't aren't. And she was like, yes. So I'm in a complete."
