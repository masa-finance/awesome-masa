And then about an hour, an hour and a half later, Vicki DM's me on discord and she's like, are you okay? I just saw what happened on Twitter. I was like, uh oh. I'm like, am I hacked? I'm like, did I. I'm like, I hope not. Did I like Steve Aoki? This thing or whatever, I went and it all looked fine to me. So I, you know, threw a message in the war room and they all told me that I was suspended. And I was, I was so pissed because I've seen this happen to many people before and not everyone gets their account back. And you never know, like with Elon cutting all that staff, how that, how the, you know, appeal process is going to go. And I didn't know if it was going to be a permanent thing.

I'm not sure if he remembers, but no, I don't. Des, you can guess. And anybody in the chat, throw your guesses in there. How many hours a week pre ban was I spending on the Twitter mobile app? How many hours a week spent on the Twitter mobile app? Mackie, do you have a guess? I sure do. I'm going to guess 69 hours. That's a little high, but it's a great guess. Thank you.

Must have mayo. So I make my own, and I posted the recipe. And don't, oh, throw up top. Yeah, I did. Don't fud me specifically saying cuisinart. The reason you need to use a cuisinart food processor is because cuisinart, unlike every other food processor I have come into it, had an encounter with. This is not a fact. Like, this is just my anecdotal experience. Cuisinart has a tiny hole in the bottom of the plunger of the lid that's perfect for emulsifying things that you're making. So you pour the oil into that tiny hole, and it will slowly drip it into your mayo if you're making it, and that's how you get the proper emulsification. So if you're going to make a recipe that uses mayo and it's, like, a significant ingredient, or if you're, like, you know, really extra and serving sandwiches or burgers or whatever, highly recommend we are."

I think we have to have the level of self awareness where when we talk about american breakfast, it's just that we're talking about american breakfast, and, like, the entire planet does not eat what Americans eat for breakfast. And that changes your breakfast take severely. Right? Like, you know, having, like, eggs and bacon or, you know, cold cereal and milk is, like, pretty american in nature. And that, I think, affects your breakfast takes. And that also reminds me of someone who's not here. So I don't think I can call them out by name. But there is a member of the Djen network who legitimately thinks that you need to cook bacon in oil. And, like, I just can't even respond to that with words, only violent gestures."

And so I think you're totally spot on there as far as most of these takes. Being almost solely american today, I said we were going to close it down with Emily, but circles got rugged before, so he is back and he started this train.
