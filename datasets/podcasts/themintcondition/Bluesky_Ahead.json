You have to, you know, be part, be on the platform, kind of earn yourself some invites and pass them along to friends. And so you can see on the timeline, it's kind of doing that thing where everybody, it's in that stage of the cycle where everybody sees people posting about it and wants an invite for themselves. And so, you know, it's kind of all the talk of the town I've seen over the last couple of days. And our good friend Mackie has been deep in the blue sky streets. So I wanted to get his opinion on the platform. Little pros and cons and, you know, if it's worth it, should we all be trying to get ourselves a blue sky invite? We talk a lot on this show about kind of, I would say, platform risk. Right? Like, how risky is it to be tied to one platform for your audience. And I think the problem that we all have when it comes to this is like, we've built audience here. It's hard to get new audience on these new platforms. It's hard to get any traction on these new platforms. There's so many of them that are coming out. How do you choose which ones are going to win? And so I have seen, I think, the most chatter about Blue sky versus some of the other ones, like far Caster or wherever that have come out recently. So I wanted to pick Mackie's brain from somebody who's been deep in the streets and see what his opinion was. So I will say none of that is on the show notes. So that is all from just off the top of the noggin."

A lot of the stuff's in the same spots. The handles are unique. And you see if you've seen screenshots and in Bsky social. But I, if you have a website like dgen.net work, for instance, you can make that your handle. And so impersonation is a lot more difficult in that regard. And I think that's really special."

And you just don't get opportunities like this to be on the bleeding edge of technology too often. I'm lucky enough that my friend Natasha gave me an invite code.

He is, like, talking with them at this point and communicating about the potential for his version of spaces that he spun up in 36 hours of work to be integrated into the app natively.

So you can write threads a little easier and you're giving it permission to post on your behalf. Right. To follow people on your behalf. And one of the things I want to say before you ask your question is that in Twitter, you connect and authorize your account. Like when you sign in with Twitter. Right. In blue sky, you have the ability to put in your real password. Like you sign up or you go to this website, it's called skyspaces.net. and you go there and it asks for your bluesky handle and password. But in Bluesky, in the app, you can create app specific passwords that are this randomly generated 16 alphanumeric character password that you can then use with your handle to sign in without giving your full credentials. So it's a little bit more, I think it's better than the authorization that."

Nodi, checking throughout the day, responding to everybody. So it kind of takes care of itself, honestly, on Twitter, for me, not totally, but. So I'll probably refocus some of that reply guy time, some of that. Just general organic interaction floating through the feed and kind of like replying to people and retweeting people you like because you don't even, I don't even know, I just called it retweeting. Right on Bluesky. The lingo isn't there. The vernacular hasn't developed and it's, yeah, I don't know if it's worth it yet, but certainly when you have better access to, or you have a smaller pool that has access to bigger names, like it is beneficial, like, there's no way in hell that I could have gotten reply from Kumail, right."

And super interesting. I really like the idea that you could build upon the app protocol like that and kind of, it seems permissionless ish. I don't know the exact details, but that's really interesting to me. Steve, are you, do you have a blue sky invite? How are you interested? Or are you too invested where you are.

But it's really complicated, right? Even people on web three didn't quite understand it at first. Raising my own hand. But the other thing is, what would be really cool for them if they wanted to do it? So I was thinking about how travel loyalty programs would like status match, like Delta United, maybe even give you a little bump just to switch over to their world. I do wonder if they could build a software where it's like when I log in, I connect my Twitter through an API and then I can follow anybody I'm already following who has already done the same and moved over and vice versa.

Uh, but I think it is of significance because we've talked a couple times and as recently as last week about, you know, what Nike and Dot swoosh were doing and how it sort of started to feel like they were leaving artifact out of a lot of the things they were doing. And then you saw, you know, very, very clearly over the last couple days. You saw the billboard in Tokyo with the AR, Air Force one Murakamis, and it's very clearly branded Nike and artifact there. It looks like the Nike swoosh is on the side as well as the, like. Yeah, the tongue. And then it's got the artifact logo on the other side. And now I'm going to call our friend Dow Jones. He famously, when the crypto kicks came out, was very upset that they didn't have any Nike markings on them. So I would imagine he'd be pretty pumped about these if he, if he had an opinion on them, because they are, I mean, very clearly co branded. So I think there's, I think that should hopefully kind of put some artifact holders at ease, because I think the biggest concern was, hey, Nike's doing all this stuff solo outside of artifact. And where does that tie in. Come in. I think this is kind of the first demonstration, doesn't it?"

Like, if you take the original, you know, the shoes that we got, isn't it better for sneakerheads that are kind of in the know that, you know what I'm saying? Like, doesn't it not make it a bit more exclusive or rare that it doesn't have a Nike logo on it?

        "text": "You know, I'm saying, yeah, no, I'm, I'm with you. I can definitely see why people were upset originally without them. My, and my guess was always with the crypto kicks that there was likely a legal reason because of what they're trying to do with them. Right. As far as kind of pairing them with the, like the RFC chip and potentially introducing some kind of where to earn type of thing, I always had a feeling that that was more of a legal thing than a branding thing. And so to see them actually, you know, smack the, like, Nike logo on this is, I think maybe confirmation of that for me at least. But yeah, I get, I get what you're saying. Like, it's if, you know, it's kind of like if you know, you know, but at the same time it's like, hey, you know, there was such thing as a Zoom MP3 player, but nobody fucking wanted it because it wasn't an ipod. You know what I mean? There's a little of that, like you."

Um, and it was a like ar interactive billboard where the shoes popped out. It was co branded Nike artifact. It was very, very cool. So that was exciting to see. Um, and, you know, it's it's just like what the power of these big brands, if they do stuff right, can do. And I don't know, that stuff's exciting to me. Um, speaking of Dow Jones, though, I do want to, uh, go to his comment up at the top. He says, hey, at Bluesky, the more people who go to your ghost town of a platform and have no friends on it, the sooner people leave it for dead and come back here.

You not only have to have mass adoption of blue sky, but the mass adoption of blue skies space, like, particular spaces versus somebody else. Is that kind of what we're thinking is going to happen?

Right now, the way the spaces work is I can go to that skyspaces.net page, create one, and I'll give like a random string of letters and numbers at the end of a URL and you can actually take that URL and put whatever you want at the end right now and create a space with that name. You can't name the title of the room like chamber just did. You can't do that. I believe there. I've been told there are some content moderation abilities now. Like, you can kick somebody at this point, but you couldn't do that yesterday.

But there is somebody who said, like, basically said, give a clue. And she said, my clue is in the, is the first word of the tweet and the first word is breaking. I don't know what that means.
