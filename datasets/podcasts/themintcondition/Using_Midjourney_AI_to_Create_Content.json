Was just kind of, like, driving around, and I'm like, you're gonna get in there. Like, you know, you're like, hey, I'm in. Like, you know, I got my nap in. I'm ready to. I'm ready for action.

Turns out it's the guy. And then, like, some of the cops come to the beach and they're like, hey, we can't bring them through the public beach, which is kind of where we came. Can we bring them through your beach? And I'm like, well, 1 second. Let me get my kid in the house and, you know, make sure nobody knows what's happening. And, yeah, we'll definitely do that. So, sure enough. Yeah, they, you know, they took the body out, and this was literally in the middle of my holiday. And, you know, my wife did not go back in the water for the rest of the week. I did not let that stop me. I don't think I went in that day, but first thing the next morning in the water, I wasn't letting, you know, the curse of dead man's cove take over my holiday.

Which is just egregious, but that gets you, I believe, 30 fast hours or 15 fast hours a month. And so, like, your fast hours are. Have to do with how fast your individual jobs render. Right. So the more fast hours you have, the more speedy jobs you can. You can do. And if you. And by that, like, you know, if you've never used it before, you're talking, I don't know, maybe 20 seconds a render. Like. Right. That's. That's your fast job.

Definitely in the $30 tier, but I'm not a. I assume you can do this if, with any paid tier, you can actually dm the mid journey bot yourself, right? So like, and then if you dm the bot, you can just do stuff right there in a DM, so you don't need to see or get lost in all of the shuffle of mid journey discord, which is crazy. There are 16 million people in the discord. There are 1.5 million people active at any given time. So the discord's pretty crazy with people prompting inside the discord. There's benefits to that too, though, if you're learning, right? Because you can see kind of what everybody's prompting and what their output is. So it's a really cool place to maybe get some inspiration. However, it gets old pretty quick when you're trying to do your own thing. So pro tip number one, dm the bot and get your own kind of private little version. Pro tip number two, once you start really getting into it chamber like it sounds like you're headed towards, you can actually spin up your own private discord server, like a full on server like we would have for DGen or whatever, but just make one for yourself and you can add the mid journey bot in there and then you can make channels that for like each one of your works, right, so. Or like categories of stuff that you're doing. So like, you know, sixties cannabis, you can have your own channel and it starts you, you can find stuff and things like that. And then I would recommend like pinning the stuff that you like most to go back and reference well, especially for."

I, when I showed my brother midjourney for the first time, he had the same response, and, like, he became, you know, instantly hooked. And he, he, I was like, why do you like it? And he's like, it's basically my favorite game right now. And I was like, what do you mean by that? Because I thought that was very interesting. And, like, when you think about it, it totally is, right? Your goal is to get, the goal of your game is to get what you want out of your prompt, right? And then it's just like this rapid a b testing, like, as fast as you possibly can.

I don't methodically, like, save them in a document or anything. Right. And it's like, I wish I could take. I wish I could scrape my discord, which is, I actually was just thinking about how to do this. I wish I could scrape my little private discord for all my prompts and, like, do it my. Do that. What? You're talking about myself. Right? Like, we. I could take, in theory, I could find all the ones I upscaled. And if I upscaled, it means I liked it, meaning I could go then find commonalities and what I did there and really hone in on that. Like, I would love to be able to do that.

And see what you get. And then do. Imagine red Colon, Colon. House. Colon, Colon. See what you get, and then do something like red colon, Colon. Two. House. Colon, Colon. One. What you're actually doing there is separating the prompts, right. So, like, your first one should give you, like, a red house very specifically. Right. The second one should give you, like, is basically saying, I want to separate the word red from the word house. So you might get a house with, like, a crazy red background. And then the third one, you're actually weighting the word red two times more than you're weighting the word. I'm sorry."

Because essentially, what it does is the easy way to explain it is it's kind of creating four different options from the same prompt rather than kind of like four close options. It's kind of a creativity lever, I would say. Right. It's like if you did Red House regular and then you did Red House Chaos 100, the first one's gonna give you some, what, different versions of the same thing. The other one will give you, like, four very different distinct versions of that that you can play with. And so, like, it kind of gets more for your money unless you're trying to dial into something very, very."

And there's, like, very subtle and very heavy or whatever it is, and then when you hit the very subtle, you can try to, like, add to the prompt, like, add the bandana colors or whatever and see if that works or helps. And that's probably the closest. That's probably the easiest way to be able to do it without, like, actually just taking the image and then go to, like, Photoshop and change it yourself. You know what I mean? But that's definitely. There are other tools that are, like, really good at that. Right? Like, I think Photoshop's version has something now where you can kind of prompt what you want to add to the image. Like, you have an image and you're like, oh, make this red. You know what I mean? So there's that that you could do as well."

Don't forget, set your reminders for tomorrow and the rest of the week. Coffee with Captain from Captain Zwingli. Up top. Chris put his reminder links up there for the whole week. Set those reminders. Congratulations on the announcement today, Chris announcing, in conjunction with Mister Benjamin, the board shorts endeavor. Those are some pretty cool looking board shorts. Going to be grabbing myself a pair. I think he's putting them in the made by apes ecosystem, which is pretty cool. So congratulations, Cap. That is so cool to see you out there doing stuff with your ip. And we haven't even talked about the honey stuff on this show yet. Well, we could get there at some point. I was telling my wife today that she should be putting honey in her coffee and I might need some samples, Cap, so there's that. But congrats, Cap. Set your reminders for coffee with captain tomorrow. In the afternoon, we've got J. Webb and Riggs at noon, followed by new time slot for alpha afternoons, a court and also a new host joining them. So Jack, our beloved Jack, is the third host now of Alpha afternoons, 02:00 p.m. eastern on YouTube and Twitter. So you can check that out tomorrow as well. That is going to do it for us. Until next time, stay mint."
