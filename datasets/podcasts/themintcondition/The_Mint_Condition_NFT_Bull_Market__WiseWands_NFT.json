Even if, like, even if what we're seeing is the run in the best projects, right. Your apes, your cool cats, your doodles. Right. If you're seeing a run in the best projects, that would kind of tell you, though, that the market's getting more savvy. So you may not see 30 drops a day that sell out, right. But you may see this flight to quality with the best projects scattered along the way that are launching are the ones that kind of sell out and present opportunity. What do you think about that?"

And so I'm still wondering, like, how does general public really get into some of these blue chips and where do they go if they're not getting into it? And so, you know, that, that's a whole other question. But I, and I think over time, fractionalization, I think, is going to be a really big part of getting those kind of newer, less pocket heavy people into nfts and into these blue chip projects. So I think that's where we're going. But I've been saying this for a while. I think over time we're going to see the market for small projects that 20 a day launched that we used to see kind of fade away. And that's good overall for the health of the market.

So at the current price of Ethereum, well over $200,000 to buy an OG ape, up to 5.8k unique owners out of the 10,000. So approaching 60% ownership. But I think even bigger story is the mutants.

The seven day chart. You see some of these new releases on here and you're not really seeing a ton in this top ten, right? You've got bored apes at one and two. You got crypto punks at three sandbox doodles, this one brand new. This is a derivative of apes. So not too surprised on that. Congratulations to our boy JP Kaz, who just sold a smiles for 1.79 e or 1.749 eth. There you go. JP Kaz. Congrats on that. As we're talking about smiles. But then you got cool cats, crypto, the corruption is new, right? But then kennel club, kongs, the serums, and then you've got, you know, smiles, newish, mechiverse, Decentraland. So like, not a lot of new things to your point chamber, which I think is interesting. I wonder if the same is true if we go like, let's go last 24 hours here and what are we at for 24 hours? Same, right. You're not seeing any of these new releases with massive 24 hours volume. Here's brain drops, by the way. Sorry, guys, I didn't know. But, but it's true."

They announced their alpha stage, almost a point or summer, almost an one ETH floor for a plot of sandbox land, which is insanely, I mean, that's awesome.

There's like a natural progression with people that have come in from NFTs through top shot. You go, top shot, you go, you go, top shot, you go, Ethan. FTS. And then you've seen in the last month or so, people kind of creep in. Well, NFTs got defied, right, with the staking and all these coins, and that kind of led people to learn a little bit about staking in defi and all that kind of stuff. And then, you know, when the market's slow, they dabble in shit coins. And that's typically right. Lots of people probably made a lot of money. Lots of people probably lost a lot of money. I will. I'm here to tell you that if you're going to buy any meme coin, it should be the original GM. And I think there's, like, a cultural meme here that could actually play out.

And yeah, I, I had heard I was on a, I don't know if I was on a space. I think I'm on a spaces. Talk about just like the, the general kind of founding of the gaming industry and how it ties into what we're seeing now with the revolution and, and actually Mike's game, which he'll tell you about a bard's tale was brought up as kind of one of the kind of four, four runners in truly rpg game mechanics. And it was launched back in the eighties and Mike was the original creator and developer of that. And now, you know, many years later, I'll say just many years later, coming to the forefront with a new game and a new project that's related to nfts and crypto, which I think is such a great evolution to, to talk about, you know, where we started and where we're going now. So like I said, mike, you have a really interesting background. Obviously, the game is a bard's tale. I'm just curious, like what was your experiences back then and kind of what led you to the development of a bard's tale?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, you know, I've hear, I've gone from one revolution to another one. I started as a gamer. When I was in high school, I played old school dungeons and dragons. I was a dungeon master. I was an artist. I illustrated my, my dungeons. I read fantasy books. And then all of a sudden, people started buying Apple II computers. It was the first time there were computers. A couple of my friends, my rich friends had Apple II computers. And I, first thing, I looked at it, I said, can you play games on this thing? And they said, yeah, there's actually some games out. They were basically arcade style games. So anyway, I eventually I got my own computer. I was up at Berkeley. I was studying architecture, and this whole revolution was just starting to take off right around then. And some products were coming out. I bought a game called Wizardry, and it had, it was an rpg. It was very simplistic game. It had wire frame corridors that you could explore down. It was a first person game. And I spent many nights playing this game. And I was doing my own development right then I was doing some arcade style kind of games. I was writing in 6502 assembly language at the time. And I had, I was. I dropped out of school. I'd gotten picked up by a gaming company up in Berkeley. They actually had an office in Berkeley. And all of a sudden, I'm looking at this game. I thought, man, I can, I could write a much better game than this. And I started thinking about all the things that I could do to enhance the experience, to make it more realistic. And I started working it out, and that, that became the bard's tale. I I walked into a one gaming company. This. Everything was exploding. So you had these little companies that were becoming gigantic at the time. I walked into one small gaming company, and I. I demoed a prototype of bard's tale. It wasn't called the bard's tale till later, but I demoed a prototype for the CEO in his office, and the guy basically kicked me out the door. I was 19. He's like, what the hell do you know? And let me tell you about what, what makes a game good? And he's, you know, lecturing me. Anyway, I left there, you know, over the course of the next year, I connected up with some other people, and we made it into the door of another upcoming small, but upcoming company. You've heard of electronic arts, and they had a better vision, and they jumped all over it. And that's just how it happened. It was an exciting time. It was a huge revolution. It was a revolution just in personal computers. But at the forefront of that at the time was gaming. That was the thing. Everyone was excited about are the games that you could play on them. I dropped out of college and I was, you know, never looked back."

So, you know, talk about like, what are the similarities or feelings that you are that are exciting you about this space and what's coming for, you know, gaming that, you know, you felt back then. What, what kind of similarities are you feeling?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Right. You know, it's, it's, it's got a similar vibe to that what happened back then. It's very similar, but I think even more on fire today because everything in the crypto gaming space right now is just red hot. And I think it's because back then we can only see certain things kind of dimly. Back at that time. I mean, the technology was so primitive and I think the ideas were way, way out in front of the technology, but everyone was excited, but there was no sense, I mean, there was no Internet back then. There was no sense that we were going to get to this kind of multiverse concept back then. I mean, that was an idea and that was what I was shooting at in the bars. Tale was first person. It was pseudo 3d immersive. I did the best I could given the technology. But now, see, we're right there. We're seeing it. It's coming alive. We're, we're seeing things roll. We see virtual reality rolling out and crypto's, you know, at the core of pretty much everything that's going on right now because there's no one company that's going to bring this future in. It's communities that are going to bring it in. It's decentralization. So people that are excited about it, people that want to be part of it, people that want to profit by it and invest in it and want to ride along with it. So that's driving all of this right now. I think it's the future. It's the future of gaming, I'm absolutely positive. And the excitement's building, so it's like that. But it's beyond because we're so close to it. And I think the NFT community is most excited about it because they're the ones that are experiencing it. I mean, we're the ones looking at this at this point. People that are investing in these, in all kinds of new leading edge technologies, they're the ones that are seeing it. Other people really are just starting to become aware of what's happening."

And it lots so crazy to talk about from then until now. So it's, it's incredible. And I love how EA was looked at as kind of like the small studio savior. Like, you know, we're gonna do stuff that's different now. They're looked as, you know, the mega brand have that evil empire background."

You know, you had mentioned when you were just talking about how, you know, these kind of communities are and decentralization is gonna pave the way for this stuff. So, you know, in your opinion, you know, where is, where are large gaming studios and companies like EA or, you know, Ubisoft and like, where are, where is, are those companies heads at versus what's actually happening right now? And do you think it's going to be a much slower grind for them or how do you see that whole thing happening?"

I think some of them are talking about it like they recognize it's going this way, but I don't think they're going to be fully committed because again, what drives this space are individuals who profit by their investment and participation, not some big monolith that controls all of it and really isn't about the end product. They're much more about profits. So I think you're going to see the biggest things happening coming directly out of the crypto space and not the big game houses. Eventually they'll line up with this, but I don't think they're going to lead this in any way."

        "text": "Right on. Well, the, the NFT project's going to bootstrap the development of the video game. The NFT project's going to launch in on January 6, 2022. We've got 10,000 wizards stored in the Ethereum blockchain. They're unique with regard to art. There's seven base types of wizards. So seven gender species, not just one base art type. So there are seven for variety because this is going to feed directly into the game. In the game, you're going to be your wizard. So, so each wizard has a magical affinity. There are eight different affinities that relate to fundamental powers in the game, like fire or death or darkness or something like that. So, and those affinities are going to unlock spells in the game. So that's part of the artwork. It's also part of the Stats for the NFT. I've had this idea, I've had an idea for this game for years, bouncing around in my head. I've thought about doing it at a couple different points and it was really coming across nfts and this community where everything clicked for me and I thought, this is, this is how I'm going to get this done. You know, basing it around spellcasting. There's, there's kind of a big history for me with that. That was originally Bard's tale was going to be all spellcasters. There were seven spellcasting classes in Bards tale. And then when I came up with this idea of duration over time spells, that just this idea came to me as I was putting the game together. Then I thought, what if some of the spells triggered music that played in the background so you knew when the spell was running or not running? And then I thought, okay, that's a bard character. Then I just expanded the game and I had to add in warriors and things like that to make it more conventional rpg. Here I am back on magic again. This concept is all magic based. Everybody wants to have that kind of power in life. So when I make that central to the game, I know it's going to draw everybody in. It's just that kind of concept. Yeah. So why am I doing this as an NFT? Like I said, I just came across this recently and I thought this is the way this is going to be much better than a crowdfunding campaign. I want a people behind the game, and this is, I'm getting a certain kind of person involved here in the NFT space. It's the exact kind of person that I want involved in this. People who love projects, they believe in, they love community. They want to, they want, they want to participate because they're, they're also part of the investment in this thing. They're not just sort of a nameless person, but they, if this game succeeds, that they're going to succeed also. I just think that's an amazing model. And. Yeah, and I've had people contact me on Twitter and just tell me, man, I miss playing your game. You know, I played it back in the eighties, and I'm glad that you're doing this, you know, and so we're gonna have. We're gonna do it again."

And some of the things coming out even clone x while still remaining tune ish is very high fidelity. I like the, the artistry on these wizards. I think they kind of play into, you know, that the game style that we're talking about, which is probably a little bit in between kind of cartoon slash super high fidelity realism. Yeah, I think it's, I think it's an awesome project. I think gaming and figuring out how we address this, like how can we create something that's play to earn but not necessarily like, you know, farming or multi level kind of, you know, the system. We've gotten down with Axie a little bit and, you know, how do we, how do we bridge that? Because I keep talking to, you know, non NFT crypto people and the, the sentiment is like, yes, we all love video games. We've played them for many years. We've sunk so many hours into them. But then at the end of the day, what do we have to show that we've, you know, what we've accomplished? And I think that's what you're saying is like, this is on the blockchain forever. These are your assets. That ownership, I think, is really exciting."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. I love the, I love the aspect that, like the NFT that you're getting that's going to be your character in the game. Right. So you're giving people, you know, not only from, oh, I've minted maybe something rare and that's really cool, but the ability to kind of choose with, with really what they're passionate about from all of the items that you put out right where I think that's got a really cool aspect to it that, you know, I haven't really thought about when you think of, you know, video games and, and things like that. So that, that's really neat as well. So just one more time here. It's just so we know kind of exactly the timeline. So when can we expect kind of the launch for this and things like that?"

Some alpha release. The level of functionality is just going to depend on, you know, a number of different factors, but we're going to, we'll have some kind of a game. We're planning to deliver some kind of game later in the year."

I was going to say what is, you know, in your past experience and things like that, what is the development time for, for a functioning game like this typically look like in the past? And then how does that differ from maybe the difficulty to put it out in a blockchain form now?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Right? Yeah. Normally you're going to want to probably take a couple of years to fully develop a game like this, but we're feeling like because of the community and the support and the way we're doing this, we need to get something out. So we're going to just do this in phases. We're going to get a phase out of playable. It's more than a prototype. It'll actually give you full gameplay, but it's just not going to have the extent of a full blown game. It's going to take a couple of years for us to get this to what we think of as an end result, but we want to deliver something to the community just to keep them excited."

I think it's super important, too, when you have, you know, when you have people buying your project because of how excited they are in the potential of it. And so to, you know, be able to deliver that like sneak peek, if you will, from the community, for the community is, I think, really awesome."

Are you guys thinking of doing any sort of, like, not, you know, but maybe pre sale whitelisting, anything like that with people who join your, you know, your ranks and Twitter and discord today?"

I mean, that's our, we're going to get some things happening this week. We're going to start to build the community right now. We've let people know that have come on early and already started to support us and market the project that they're going to get on that list and have the chance to buy a couple wizards before the official launch date.

And I'd like Mike's feedback on this because I was just a little. I was just a little, you know, a little chamber back then. And I remember, you know, before Nintendo, before everything, I had a computer and I would play video games on this. And I remember a game now. Again, I've smoked a lot of weed in my life, so my memories are. I need a little reinforcement of this memory, but I remember a game called Montezuma's Revenge. I don't know if you're familiar with this one. It was, again, might just be a, you know, a fever dream I've had, but it was one of my absolute favorite games as, like, a five or six year old. And I played all the time. That and, like, a kung fu game. And I just didn't. I just didn't know if you remembered any of those great, you know, Commodore 64 games."
