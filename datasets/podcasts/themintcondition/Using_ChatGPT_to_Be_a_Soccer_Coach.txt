Speaker A: Well, here we are. Do you. Are you familiar with the. You know, the kings of Canada? The tragically.
Speaker B: I was not familiar. That was my first go around with them.
Speaker A: So the tragically. It's a fun band. It's. It's you. You would be hard pressed to find a bigger band that is localized to one country.
Speaker B: Really.
Speaker A: It's. The lead singer a couple years ago, ended up getting, like, terminal brain cancer.
Speaker B: Oh, wow.
Speaker A: And they did one last cross country tour, and the last show was televised, and it was the number one televised show in Canada of all time.
Speaker B: Of all time.
Speaker A: Like, it's crazy how popular they are, whether you're, like, 70 years old or, like, 20 years old. It's. It's. It's a. It's. It's a wild. It's a wild thing here. It's. I couldn't give you an american, like, it's like, taking. I don't know, maybe, like, bought, like, bon Jovi. I'm trying to think, like, a massive, like, I think of, like, America bad. Like, bon Jovi, maybe like, Bruce Springsteen.
Speaker B: There you go.
Speaker A: But, like, nobody else knows who they are. You know what I mean? Wow. Yeah, it's. I was listening to them. I was doing a lot of gardening today, so I was listening to them in the backyard, and electricity a little bit.
Speaker B: Electricity?
Speaker A: Yeah. Electrical box in the back, so plugged in the old speaker and crushed some hip. You ever crush a hip bunch?
Speaker C: Are we gonna, like, do a show, or are you just gonna talk about canadian, nobody bans if I was going.
Speaker A: To talk about canadian, nobody bans if you talk about our lady peace.
Speaker B: Well, we got a lot of canadian news today, don't we? Or somewhat, do we?
Speaker C: There's some canadian things happening right now. In fact, chamber, in mentioning the tragically hip. I was watching your favorite show letter Kenny, last night, and they referenced the tragically hip, and I thought of you, and so it is very fitting that I saw.
Speaker A: That's awesome.
Speaker C: Across the screen today. Yeah, but what's going on? I don't know. Look, I have a bone to pick with pain.
Speaker A: Let's have it out.
Speaker C: Messing up the links.
Speaker A: As much as I hate.
Speaker C: I got to see behind. I got to see behind the scenes of what Payne does all day, because him and I were hanging out in the DJ network war room VC, and, you know, as he sat around playing video games most of the day, and it's. Then the link doesn't work. So we're gonna have to have you step into the office, and, you know, we've got a bone to pick pain. You want to defend yourself here.
Speaker B: In fairness, I was actually on a call with chamber just before that, so fair. And we were not productive either.
Speaker A: No.
Speaker C: No. It was a wonderful time when we've been hanging out in the war room voice chat, and I came back from some meetings and pain was hanging in there playing some. What was the game again? I. It was a blockchain game from the treasure and magic ecosystem.
Speaker B: Yeah, it was called the beacon.
Speaker C: And yeah, it was pretty cool to watch. It was like a yemenite, fully, you know, fully functioning. Looked like a Zelda original style, kind of pixel, dungeon y type of game. Very cool. So I'm going to have to check that out because I really enjoyed playing that or watching him play that, actually. So get it. Got a little TLdr on the mechanics there. Pain, how does it all work?
Speaker B: Well, so your assets can come all. Actually, I forgot the. As far as the game wise, it is off chain. So if you want to sell that character or whatever, you would take it off. But it's a. It's a game that's in beta and they do dungeon runs and you go around and you, like he said, it's very Zelda esque. You're going around killing three or four different types of creatures and they have a lot of special events centered around just different things. So I found the replayability of it very enjoyable. And now that my PC setups finally together, there's a couple other games that I want to potentially stream too that I think that you'd like. Bunch.
Speaker C: I'm totally on board. I've been really enjoying the Degen network voice chat the last couple days. Chamber, you're gonna have to stop by sometime. Just streaming some. Some AI tinkering as I mess around in the world of AI. We've been streaming all that. Yeah, I've been basically holding some sessions in.
Speaker A: I have some questions for pain too, actually, because I don't know. I don't know what he does for a living. I don't know if he's ever told me. And then it started getting me thinking. I'm like this guy, he's playing video games, we're having calls. He either is a 40 year old cannabis worker who was also into web three, like me, who has this kind of time. He could be like 18 and just like, you know, and I don't know, and I talk to him all the time. Or it could be like just independently wealthy and it's just like, you know, fuck it. I'm gonna. I'm gonna play around with these guys. So it's an enigma to me. He's. The lifestyle is familiar to me, but I don't have. I don't know if it's exactly similar to mine. Pain you want to disclose?
Speaker B: I am. I am somewhere between 18 and 41, and that's probably the best I could give. But the thing is, we have talked a little bit about it. It's obviously you don't remember, so it must have not been that influential to you.
Speaker C: He thought it was v squared, that is.
Speaker A: That could be. That being said, I didn't know bunches other kid's name the other day, too, and I feel like that was a miss on my.
Speaker C: He doesn't know what I did.
Speaker A: I forgot his wife's name. My wife asked me, like, oh, yeah, what's. What's her name again? Well, I.
Speaker C: Isn't that so weird? Like, how that can be a thing? Like, we are, I would say, pretty close to, like, best friends, and we have never met, and, you know, we don't. We barely know the, you know, inner workings of each other's lives.
Speaker A: However, even if we were, like, even if we were neighbors, I'm terrible with remembering things.
Speaker C: Oh, if we were neighbors, we would have a much worse relationship than we do now, that's for sure.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: Because I don't know my neighbors very well. At least. At least the one to my immediate right. I don't know very well. The ones to my left asked me after meeting them one time to write them a recommendation letter for adoption. And I didn't really know how to take that. I did it, and I wrote them a very nice letter.
Speaker A: How well do you know them?
Speaker C: Like, scale one to ten, like a.
Speaker A: .5 I had my neighbor ask me to, like, I don't know if you have to do the same for passports in the US, but you typically have another person kind of, like, vouch for you in Canada. So there's like a. Like a guarantor. I don't know. I forgot what's called, but my neighbor asked me to be his, and I was just like, really, bro? Like, you know, you don't have anybody else.
Speaker C: What is the guarantee that you will?
Speaker A: I mean, I can confirm. I don't know. Like, they called me the other day, like, the. The passport office, and it was hilarious because they're asking me, they're like, yes, somebody, you know, put your name as a reference for passports. And I'm like. I'm like, oh, maybe it was like, I didn't even. I wasn't even 100% sure it was him because I remember him kind of mentioning something about getting a passport. I'm like, I guess they're like, do you know his name? And I say his name, and I come, like, I barely remember his last name. And. And I'm like, oh, his name's Bob. Like, his first name. His first name's Bob. And she's like, that's not the name we have on record. I'm like, well, that's the name. Bobert.
Speaker C: Bobert?
Speaker A: Yeah. Is it possibly Bobertan?
Speaker C: Ah, yes.
Speaker A: They're like, when's his birthday? I'm like, I have no idea.
Speaker C: You're like, I barely know his address.
Speaker A: She's like, can you describe him? I'm like, like, what? Like, height and weight. I'm like, I have no idea. Five?
Speaker C: I don't know. Kind of an asshole. Leaves his trash cans out too long. What else do you want?
Speaker A: I couldn't tell him. Like, and they're like, does he have short or long hair? I don't. Like, like, medium length hair. Kind of brownie gray, I think. I'm not sure.
Speaker C: You described, like, the sketch from the. The police sketch from the leprechaun video.
Speaker A: No, I don't know what that is.
Speaker C: The viral leprechaun video. Oh, come on. I'm don't.
Speaker A: I'm sorry. I'm not that cool.
Speaker C: First of all, somebody in the comments knows the leprechaun video with this police sketch. Please drop that in the comments if you know what I'm speaking about. Let's go to. Let's go to circles on a Friday. Circles. Gm GMG. How you guys doing? Oh, man. Wonderful. I've got so much energy today. I'm the opposite of I was yesterday, so I'm. I was very low, low t yesterday. Today I am raging with tea, so we're getting after it. What about you, circles? I'm doing good. Coming to just about the end of the workday, so that is very good news. So, yeah, you were mentioning the voice chat, and I'm really digging just kind of utilizing that and having fun in there. I did notice, I think, the DSPn one, anybody can, like, stream anything in there, but the regular war room one, is that able to have anybody stream in there? Because I tried it once and wasn't able to. I just fixed it this morning as I was. I didn't realize that it was gated or there was, like, it was role gated, so I forget who I was. Was it you, Payne, that was trying to share this morning. Somebody was this morning and could have been. And I fixed it. So mister house. Maybe he should have been a. Oh, it was Mister House. Yes. So you should be able to do that now. So you can if you. If you are in the D gen war room. Circles has been going through his coding journey in there when he has some free time. So he just pops in there and starts hacking away, which is pretty cool. So you can see all kinds of stuff going on in the Djen network voice chat these days. It's really been awesome. Circles, how is your coding journey going? That good, huh? Is it me?
Speaker B: No, it's definitely.
Speaker A: So I thought. I'm like, did he just ask me a question? Because I was reading something else. I'm like, oh, shit.
Speaker C: Circles, are you there?
Speaker B: That's classic circles.
Speaker C: Fashion.
Speaker B: His Internet does not exist.
Speaker C: Circle circles buys his Internet by the pound. And he just ran out, so I don't know. I can hear. Yes, yes, yes. We got. This is so bad. I'm sorry, guys. It's going good. Ever since you and home USda got me on today. And there he goes. Circles.
Speaker A: I just got a.
Speaker C: God damn it. Circles.
Speaker A: I have a. I need your opinion here, bunch. I just got an email, so my daughter is starting soccer on Tuesday. My youngest daughter. I got an email.
Speaker C: What is she, around the four? Five?
Speaker A: She just turned five.
Speaker C: She just turned five. Okay. Wow. I remember her when she was, like, just born. Isn't that crazy?
Speaker A: It. Absolutely. I think, yeah, we started the show, like, three months after 2020. Like, three months after I think she was born. So she's starting. And apparently her team. This is a run through the city. Her team doesn't have a coach, and they're. They're, you know, sending out an email saying, hey, if you want to help coach, should I? I have zero soccer background, okay? I have no ted. Lasso is my only frame of reference when it comes to soccer.
Speaker C: Awesome.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's all I got. Should I volunteer as maybe, like, a secondary coach? Like, an assistant coach or something?
Speaker C: Yeah, I would actually say that you should be the head coach. Here's why. Here, go. I'm gonna get here, but I'm gonna go to pain first, and then I'm gonna go back to your question. Pain.
Speaker B: This is not the daughter that you were trying to have a. Have crush.
Speaker A: This is her younger sister.
Speaker B: Okay. I was just making sure. And, yeah, you should. Absolutely. You should. Absolutely.
Speaker A: You guys want to hear what the responsibility. There's responsibilities of the coach. You guys want to hear what they are? So responsibilities of the coach. Be a positive role model. Encourage players to participate, keep players engaged and then role model again, good sportsmanship. That's. That's seems poorly structured in the. But I don't know. I feel like what are they?
Speaker C: There is positive role model. You think you can cover that one ish. I think you're positive enough. Role model. You're not. It's close. You're not. Like, it's close. Tie it off on the sidelines like you're good.
Speaker A: That is true. That is true.
Speaker C: You're good enough. Encourage people to participate. I think you could do that. What were the other ones?
Speaker A: Players engaged. These are a bunch of under. This is under six. I don't know if it's six and under or under six. I don't know. So I don't know. There'll be a bunch of five and six year old probably. That seems a lot.
Speaker C: What are your thoughts on. Why would you. What are your current thoughts?
Speaker A: So, I mean, initially, no, no way am I coaching, but it's my youngest daughter. I do a lot with my older daughter, so this is a good way for me to, you know, like, I was gonna go watch all the games anyways, but this gets me another, you know, another layer within, you know what I'm saying?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker A: So, I mean, that's the only thing I could think of that's like, kind of like a benefit.
Speaker C: So I wanted to talk about AI today because it's on.
Speaker A: Is there an AI coach I can use?
Speaker C: Well, while you were talking about that, I entered the following into chat GPT, you are a youth soccer coach that coaches five year old soccer teams. Your job is to be a positive role model. Encourage people to participate, keep players engaged and teach them about soccer and teamwork. Please give me a breakdown of how you would run a soccer practice as this coach. You ready to go through this? Can you do the following things? If you can, if you can do this, you should be the coach. Uh, I think. And Chacha Pt writes me back. Absolutely. Here's a breakdown of how I would run a youth soccer this for a five year old team. Warm up for ten minutes. Always start the practice session with a warm up. This might include a game of tag or a fun obstacle course that involves a lot of.
Speaker A: This is fucking gold already.
Speaker C: This serves to get the kids bodies moving and their attention focused. Number two, introduction and review. After the warm up, gather the team to introduce the day's lesson. This would also be a good time to review what was learned during the previous practice and we could get into you know what those lessons should be later. For instance, if you introduced dribbling in the last session, ask a few of the kids to demonstrate what they remembered. Skill focus 15 minutes now it's time to introduce a new skill or drill with five year olds. Keeping it simple and fun is key. For example, you might introduce passing by having the kids partner up and pass back and forth. Make sure to walk around. Offer praise and light, age appropriate feedback. Hey, you're disappointing your father, kid.
Speaker A: Get back out of it. Just, you know, super nice to all the kids except for my own.
Speaker C: We're not done. There's more to this. Practice mini games for 15 minutes after working on the new skill set incorporated into a mini game, this will allow the kids to apply what they learned in a game like setting. For instance, if you were focusing on passing, you can set up a small sided games where points are scored by completing passes. Look at you. You're just a great coach. Water break five minutes it's important to keep these kids hydrated and also give them a short rest. During the water break, you can chat with them about what they've learned so far and ask them to keep engaged to make sure they're doing okay. Teamwork activity ten minutes now you can introduce the activity that emphasizes teamwork. A game like passing chain where they have to pass the ball to each teammate without the opposing team intercepting could be a good one. Scrimmage for 15 minutes, cool down and review and dismissal. Remember the goal at this age to make soccer fun and foster a love of the game while teaching basic skills and teamwork. Could you do this?
Speaker A: You're saying it. I'm believing it.
Speaker C: Like, I, I'm telling you, you could do.
Speaker A: I'm in the middle of replying right now.
Speaker C: I'm your coach. GPT, tell me you couldn't just use chat GBT to make you your five year old soccer practice exercises. You absolutely no, you're going to send.
Speaker A: This to me and I'm just going to use.
Speaker C: Well, yeah, but then you're going to get, after the first practice you're going to be like, well, what the hell do I do now? You're going to need to. So this goes into our topic of the day because I'm making it that because v squared is not here today to give us our notes, I think.
Speaker A: This could be a long term bit. Let's see if we can use chat GPT for me to be a head.
Speaker C: Coach, to win a championship, like honestly.
Speaker A: Like this is something I think I don't know anything about it?
Speaker C: I'm into this, like, yeah, nothing.
Speaker A: Could I become a quality head coach or manager or manager, as they like to call?
Speaker C: I am very. I'm actually very interested in. Before we get here, let's. Let's go down to the comments. Strictly sports says, oh, my God. That's the hardest age to coach because they have no attention. Spanish. I was assistant coach to both my daughter's teams at that age, and my recommendation is to be the assistant coach. Okay, there you go. Cap says, my oldest daughter softball team for a couple years. It was awesome. Really enjoyed it. Von Fronten says, five year old soccer is not soccer. If I can coach it, anyone can. Main goal equals score in the correct goal, then. So, you know, there's some soccer comments there for you. Does that discourage you?
Speaker A: No, no. I feel okay. Still.
Speaker C: Yeah. Suarez posted a gif of you knocking somebody down.
Speaker A: Yeah. Can I fight the other coach?
Speaker C: Yeah. Sophia has entered the chat. She votes no, and they don't need coaching. They need a nap.
Speaker A: Good point.
Speaker B: She also said, can we please protect the kids from bad coaching? I don't know if that was pointed at you or not, but I'm just.
Speaker A: I mean, my. My coaching, you know, my technical skills will. Will be poor, but my managerial skills are a plus.
Speaker C: But Chachi, BT can help with your technical skills. Sock. She also says soccer. You mean football? Because Sophia is indeed european. So, you know, you might have to take a hard stance on which of those are. So what do they call it in Canada? Because you often say that you are basically european.
Speaker A: Well, you know, it's always a mix. So there's some things that we, you know, we take from. From american culture and stuff. Some stuff we keep from our past. British culture. But we do say soccer, and soccer is a british term anyways. They're the ones that, like, invented the word soccer.
Speaker C: So weird. Right here, it says, pasta break 25.
Speaker A: He's got a carb up carbon.
Speaker C: This is the portion of the practice in which you carbo load. Don't introduce sauces that are too acidic, as the children may buy a. I.
Speaker A: Just think of the fun run. I feel that's when I think Carville. I think of, you know, chicken Alfredo or whatever he was eating.
Speaker C: All right, let's. Let's get this hands. I've got circles, and then I've got one in a million Suarez then homeless circles. You have 5 seconds to prove you are not in a well. Am I in a well? No. No. Here. You sound good. Perfect. Yeah. Sorry about that. So, a. I had pinned up top the news that binance is leaving Canada. Chamber. Do you use binance? Do you have stuff in it? Because if so, you might want to get that out.
Speaker A: No, I haven't had anything in finance.
Speaker C: In a while, but this is big news as our canadian representative, other than otter, Lumen and all the other Canadians. But one person who I have immediate access to.
Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they seem to be changing some stuff. There's a site that I use predominantly. Again, it's just more for kind of exiting crypto back into fiat. I saw a couple new updates on there, so there must be some stuff happening federally or whatnot. But I'm not.
Speaker C: I mean, it sounds like it is a. It sounds like it's a regulatory joust, that what it's like. It seems like it's. Well, they tweeted binance today at 03:05. Unfortunately, today we are announcing that finance will be joining other prominent crypto businesses. So the fact that they say that in proactively withdrawing from the canadian marketplace, we would like to thank all of those regulators who worked with us collaboratively to address the needs of canadian users. So it does by. They also said, albeit a small market, it held sentimental value for us, much like most of my hidden folder as the home country of our founder. Interesting. I didn't know CZ was. Did you know that he was canadian?
Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, he definitely has canadian citizenship. Him and Vitalik both do.
Speaker C: I didn't know. I don't think I knew either of those. We had high hopes for the rest of the canadian blockchain industry. Unfortunately, new guidance related to stable coins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for binance at this time. We put off this decision as long as we could to explore other reasonable avenues to protect our canadian users. But it has become apparent that there are none. Wow. Our remaining canadian users will have or are receiving an email with comprehensive information on how this will impact their accounts. Blah, blah, blah. We do not agree with the new guidance. We hope to continue to engage with canadian regulators aimed at a thoughtful, comprehensive regulatory framework. We are confident that we will someday return to the canadian market with bags of milk and maple syrup.
Speaker A: That's so weird.
Speaker C: That's a weird way to add that tweet. But anyway, it is what it is. They know what they're talking to, so it doesn't sound like they're going to be the only ones, you know. Thoughts?
Speaker A: I mean, as long as I can. You know, as long as there's some way to exit crypto back into fiat here. That's all that really matters to me. But what is the.
Speaker C: What is the current way that you do?
Speaker A: I think there's a bunch of them. I use Coinsquare, which not a ton of people use, but I've been using it since, like, 2017. And, you know, it's just always worked well for me. There's a. There's, like, one really big one. I remember people tweeting about it the other day that, like, 80% of Canadians use. I forget what it's called, but apparently it's a good one. I just haven't pivoted there. But there's probably, like, I don't know, five or six of them.
Speaker C: Quantera or whatever.
Speaker A: The one that got Quadriga. Quadriga, yeah.
Speaker C: I've never seen a picture of Gerald cotton and chamber in the same place. However, maybe he faked his own death and now is. That's why he doesn't want to come to any IRL meetup. True.
Speaker A: I'm in India. Do you remember Maple exchange? We reported on that years ago. It was like a small canadian. Canadian exchange that, you know, I think Quadrigate as well. Yeah, I emailed the guy back, by the way. I told him I'm in.
Speaker C: You're in?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: Oh, yes. Let's do this. I love that this is now going to be. I'm going so part of our Friday shows. Whenever, whatever day of the week you would like them to be, we will actually plan out. So depending on the practice schedule is perfect.
Speaker A: And Thursday.
Speaker C: Oh, my God. So we could plan out these your practices live on the show using chat GPT. What do you think?
Speaker A: I think this is good.
Speaker C: Randall says Chamber needs to watch coach Carter for inspiration and tips. He also says, WTF is soccer? So, yeah, I forget who was next here. Let's go to one in a million. Gm.
Speaker D: Gm, everyone. How are you?
Speaker C: Wonderful. How about yourself?
Speaker D: Good. I threw my hand up to talk about the soccer, and the AI was a perfect segue because I wanted to talk more about a human element as opposed to trying to teach five year olds how to play soccer. I have coached all my kids. I got four kids and I. My little guy's about your daughter's age. Chamber pro tip. No ripping heaters.
Speaker A: Quick one. Just a sneaky little sneaky heat on the side.
Speaker C: Hold on. Let's see. Where in the practice schedule could that fit in? That looks like the water break. Five minutes.
Speaker D: I gotta run. Run to my car real quick, kids. And I gotta find my vape.
Speaker C: Penniless.
Speaker D: Another pro tip. Don't yell at the 14 year old who will be reffing. Not a. Not a good thing.
Speaker C: What's your capacity to control yourself against the refs?
Speaker A: I'm going to tell you, it's pretty low. I'm a little bit of a hothead.
Speaker C: Would you swallow the whistle?
Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I can't use profanity either. I usually fly off the handle pretty quickly.
Speaker D: That's part of the sportsmanship.
Speaker A: Yeah, that was number one. That was role model. But still, I feel like that also counts in the role model category.
Speaker D: All right, and then one. One little thing that I'll say, like, the joy that I get out of coaching my kids came from being able to watch them interact with their friends, because you don't see that shit in school, and it's a lot like, you know. So that's one thing.
Speaker A: These are the points that are gonna. That have swung me. I'm with you. I'm all about being participant.
Speaker C: Well, because you're. You're. I mean, your hesitation was the soccer part. We've got that covered now with. With Cha BT. I think you can do the rest. I think the rest is right up your alley. It was just the fact that you didn't know anything about soccer, so, like, you could definitely structure, you know, your practices in this way, and I think you have a great time. So we'll see now. Yeah.
Speaker D: But Chad. Chad GBT really over thought it. You really got to start with one thing right there. Number one should be, have fun. And I think you're pretty good at that. So if those kids have fun, then you're a badass five year old soccer coach.
Speaker A: I like this. And then we can. Through the years, we could graduate. That could be like a. I just stay with my daughter and coach her all the way up and then be like, you know, maybe the canadian. The canadian national coach. Once you become.
Speaker C: Okay, you know. Yeah. Right. You're gonna follow, and then you're gonna have, like, the Olympics.
Speaker A: You might AI is gonna be. Then they'll be able to win.
Speaker C: Hold on. We're not done yet. Based on one in a million's recommendation here, I said, can you make this practice more fun? So it says, absolutely. Here's how we can inject more fun into each section. Okay, so now you've got, in your warm up, you're playing a game of Simon or soccer. Simon says, ooh, I like this. I like that. I like that. In. In the introduction and review, you can incorporate a fun prop, like a magic hat. Yes. Whoever wears the hat gets to demonstrate what they remember last practice. I'm in love with this. These ideas. One in a million. Are these passing your, your fun parameters?
Speaker D: Absolutely. I mean, bottom line is, like, the more games, the better. Make sure they're having fun just interacting with each other, like, absolutely. I'm now more on board with AI.
Speaker C: Okay, so skill, focus. Turn the skill training game into a dribbling race where they have to dribble through a set of cones as quickly as possible. Reward the winner, like getting to use the. Or choose the next warm up game. The minigame. Use imaginative scenarios. For instance, for the passing game, they are passing a secret message that the bad guys, parentheses, coaches can't intercept. Oh, I like that. That's fun.
Speaker D: Sharks and minnows with dribbling.
Speaker A: You guys keep saying dribbling. I thought it was an AI mistake. Is dribbling a part of soccer?
Speaker C: Yeah, it's. That's the actual, like, kicking the ball. It's like stick work or stick handling.
Speaker A: And see, this is what I'm talking about.
Speaker C: Yeah, you're. You're good. We got you covered. Don't worry about it. We got this where. Where we are all soccer coaches now. Shovel says in the comments, I think this is fantastic. Can DJ network sponsor the soccer team?
Speaker A: No, these are all. This is. It's actually Tim Hortons does, like, all the soccer leagues across Canada, so they're all like, Tim Hortons sponsored soccer leagues. They're phenomenal. You should see the jersey. I'll send you a picture. Bunch. When, when.
Speaker C: Wait, every soccer. Every soccer, like, at this?
Speaker A: Yeah, like youth soccer. Like, I would say, like twelve and under is like. Like, I think I paid like $150 for the full season. And it's. What is it? Like 14 weeks plus playoffs and that's pretty. Yeah, like, you get like a. Like, you should see their jerseys. They're sick.
Speaker C: You guys get free healthcare. And you suck wild.
Speaker A: For sure.
Speaker C: It's crazy. All right. I'm really loving this angle. I'm glad we passed one in a million's fun test with the AI coaching. And it sounds like he is encouraging you to actually do this, which is good. Uh, is that correct? One in a million, you're saying go for.
Speaker D: That's a hundred. Well, and you said you're active with your older daughter, right? Shares the same name as my.
Speaker A: I mean, I burn heater is watching a ride horses, but, yeah, we'll say.
Speaker D: Well, that's a little different. You like on Zed run, watching her ride horses?
Speaker C: I like that, too. That's funny. Yeah, so I think this is good. Here we go. Suarez, what is up?
Speaker E: But I'm just dying laughing. This is just too funny. So I'm gonna go the opposite end. I don't think AI is for everything. So you need to watch kicking and screaming with that. You need to watch that. That's number one. So that'll. That will give you your playbook. And then number two, just, like, meme coins and shit. Coins. You need to set expectations very low. So, like, day one, you go in there and give a speech like, I'm a leader, and the reason I'm here, because I lead you guys didn't step up to the plate, so I'll be here, but set your expectations low. I'm gonna be wearing flip flops and vaping on the side, so don't have too high expectations.
Speaker A: Yelling, I'm not participating. I'm not running the field.
Speaker E: Exactly. And, like, the only reason any of you should speak to me is to provide me alpha to get a ring. That's it. Like that. And the only other reason you should be talking to me, make sure they're from, like, Europe or.
Speaker A: Yeah, South America.
Speaker E: Because we don't. We don't want no MLS players.
Speaker A: That's not really.
Speaker E: And there's no roadmap here. So, like, your kids getting a participation trophy, and that's pretty much it. And then watch kicking and screaming. Get yourself an assistant coach like Mike Dicka, and you're golden. You're set.
Speaker C: I. This is the breadth of opinions here and topic, or, like, how you should coach is just making my whole life right now. And I love how Suarez related coaching to basically the crypto and shitcoin market, and I'm really excited to see what things you implement from each of these comments. Chamber.
Speaker E: Side note. So I used to be the referee liaison for the USA women's soccer team. So anytime they came here into the. Into the northeast to play, I was the guy that would keep the people separated so the referees could never talk to the USA players or the opposing team. And I was the guy, like, finessing that and getting the refs to the field.
Speaker C: So interesting.
Speaker E: And then I also hold a c license in soccer, so I can coach up to you. You 14?
Speaker C: Really?
Speaker E: Um, yeah. And then you can go, your. Your BC. You're. Sorry, your b and a, but that's like, three grand. And, you know, then you're.
Speaker A: You're.
Speaker E: You're pretty much right at MLS level. And my cousin plays pro, too.
Speaker C: Forget chat. GBT. We got Suarez. GPT.
Speaker A: What do you think about becoming my.
Speaker C: Yeah, I was just, it sounds like a good idea. You could just beam them in virtually and, you know, or we could eventually have holographic Suarez out there and just yelling at these kids while you're smoking heater. So, I mean, it's like a, have you ever seen the show Friday night tight?
Speaker A: No, it's not real.
Speaker C: Oh, it's real. And it is spectacular. Yes. It's about, it's about youth football, like ages seven and eight in, in Texas. And, like, how serious they take it is just outrageous. Like, you should watch a couple episodes of that. As free as.
Speaker A: That's kind of my next question. Are there, you know, in Canada, we have a vet. It's, you know, we have a vast array of different nationalities. You know, if I'm making a hockey team, I'm looking at Russians, I'm looking at Canadians. You know what I'm saying? If I'm making a basketball team, we're going to Americans, maybe. Is there a bad, like, what are the three best soccer countries? Like who, if I'm profiling last names, you know, you know Suarez.
Speaker E: Oh, yeah, you gotta go, obviously. Well, Brazil hasn't won a World cup in a while, but Brazil, Argentina, we.
Speaker A: Have a lot of portuguese background.
Speaker C: I got plenty of French. Plenty of French.
Speaker E: That's where I would go right now.
Speaker C: Plenty of French.
Speaker A: Not the right kind of. Not that kind of. We got the other French, you know, not, not the cool France French. We got that. The Quebecois. Not the same.
Speaker C: All right, over to homeless. I'm very interested to hear homeless is soccer. Take homeless. GM.
Speaker F: Hey, gM. Now, as you explain this, this is a five year old rec soccer league, is that correct?
Speaker C: With championship aspirations.
Speaker F: Yeah. So somewhere there's a disconnect because there should not be a 14 game season and playoffs. Five year old level that just not going to work. No, with girls. With girls, yeah, they may, any rate, with girls, you're going to have a serious problem with that, I think. But the, the fun is the, the big deal on that, the 15 minutes of scrimmaging. Do not do that.
Speaker A: Okay?
Speaker F: You'll, you'll end up in misery. That's, that's not a good idea at that age. The Simon says it's awesome. Tag is awesome at every level.
Speaker A: I agree.
Speaker F: If you go on YouTube, you'll find NHL practices with guys playing tag and just losing their minds over it.
Speaker A: Interesting.
Speaker F: So those types of games are great as far as when you're doing any drills, keeping them a game. But you need to break the kids down. So there's only like five kids in each group.
Speaker C: So you're like breaking. I thought you meant mentally not destroy.
Speaker F: Them and build them up. But you need them into smaller groups and so you need at least three or four parents.
Speaker A: Interesting.
Speaker F: Helping with things because otherwise you just can't communicate with any kid and they can't follow directions because they spend too much time in line that they always need to be having something that they can do. Maybe rotating and don't treat them like boys. Do not make the mistake of thinking they're like boys and they're gonna. They don't care about winning. For the most mixed.
Speaker A: I think it's a mix.
Speaker F: They're just there to hang out and have fun.
Speaker A: I think it's a mixed.
Speaker F: Okay, that's really hard. If there's anything aggressive, go ahead.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker F: Yeah, that. It's really hard if it's boys and girls. Because if there's stuff aggressive, you'll have a lot of girls who just cower and hide.
Speaker A: Not my time.
Speaker F: Some of them are fine with the aggression, but you get a few girls that won't mind because that even happens. The sharks and minnows is great, but some of the girls, because I've had girls that I've coached, it's surprising about. I don't know, a quarter of them feel really bad about those things where they take the ball and point out that somebody's bad and has to be out of the game. There's an emotional thing that's. It's hard to connect with, at least for a man. It was until my daughter explained the problems that she was having on the team. Had the same thing. And that happened for three of my daughter. The three daughters.
Speaker A: Interesting.
Speaker C: This is.
Speaker F: But definitely it's a lot of fun to coach girls, but find all the fun drills. The other one. For a lot of sports, particularly outside, there's a playground, and instead of having multiple water breaks, give them five to ten minutes at the park.
Speaker A: This is good information here.
Speaker C: Chamber. I asked how you should construct your coaching staff. Yes, coaching a team of five year olds can be quite the task. Having a well structured coaching staff can make the process much smoother. Here's how I would construct head coach. This person's primarily responsible for planning and running practice sessions and games. Assistant coaches. Depending on the size of the team, one or two assistants would be beneficial. They could help manage the kids during practice run drills, offer individual feedback. Assistant coaches can be good at interacting or should be good at interacting with young children and also understand the basics of soccer. We'll work on that one. Team team manager. This role is often filled by a parent volunteer. Team manager can handle logistical tasks like communication with the parents, scheduling organizations of snacks and equipment. All right, this is a must. You need to have this.
Speaker A: I feel like I'm. That. I feel like that one's me.
Speaker C: Maybe I have, like, another either head or assistant. Yeah, you definitely need this person. Parent volunteers. Besides the formal coaching staff, it's great to have a group of parent volunteers who are willing to help out as needed and then a mentor and advisor. Where? This is cha Chi PT, if possible. It's also beneficial to have a mentor advisor. When selecting your coaching staff, look for individuals who are patient, positive and enthusiastic. They should understand that the goal at this age is not to win games, but foster a love for the sport, teach basic skills and promote teamwork and good sportsmanship. Regular communication and coordination amongst the coaching staff is essential. That sounds like something you're not into. Everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Thoughts?
Speaker F: Hey, I have another one that's not on there that I forgot to mention that you want to make sure you have your whole practice written out ahead of time with all the toys that you need for it and broken down to, like, five minute segments. Because if kids are doing ten minutes on the same drill, they'll lose interest. So you need to have all that written out ahead of time so that you roll through it. Usually you won't make it through the plan, but you want that ahead of time.
Speaker C: I'm. I'm just fascinated. Like, what I love so much about this show is that we just show up and, like, start talking, and it turns into an hour of, like, actual decent content about using tech to help you become a soccer coach. And then actual advice from people who have coached you.
Speaker A: I joke. It's got this email 405, like, after the show signed.
Speaker C: So good, dude. That's what I mean. Like, we did not at all have this plan. Von Frun g all right, GM guys, so first agree, the entire practice should just be a game, a series of games. Google them. I'll add kick the coach to the list of games here where you base. They basically have to hit you with a soccer ball, and they're five, so it doesn't hurt, and you just dodge and it wears them out. And then they get to practice dribbling, which, yes, is a part of. Of the sport, and. And everybody has fun. Take notes. So now, using technology, we're all here using AI. We've not talked about using social audio. Why doesn't chamber just have an Airpod in his ear? And we're all on a great idea, just giving him live thing. He's given us the play by play, and then we are giving him just live advice on the spot.
Speaker E: There's.
Speaker C: Would you be open to doing this? Youth canadian sport leagues. So, you know, like, you can't do that, like, at an NFL.
Speaker A: Actually, we could.
Speaker C: We're, like, the offensive coordinator. Like, an NFL game. He's got the headphones on. We're up in the booth. Only the booth is, like, everywhere around the world that we're on a Twitter space. I can't tell you how much I love that idea. Chamber. Would you do this?
Speaker A: Let me get, like, a couple in so I can get the logistics of it. But, yes, I think this is definitely doable.
Speaker C: Oh, my God. This is incredible. And cannot overemphasize the importance of. Of snacks. Like, if you do nothing else, if you win zero games but you win on the snacks, this is gonna be. Am I responsible for all snacking, meaning providing snacks? I believe your ten person coaching crew, that chat GPT laid out for you is gonna take care of it. I'm just saying, from objective standpoint, if you do nothing else, get the snack right. Yeah. You should have a really nice spread.
Speaker A: Orange slices.
Speaker C: Face style, maybe. Yeah. Or yes, exactly. Exactly. I'm very loose peanuts. Loose peanuts. Pocket lint and loose peanuts. I'm gonna go. I'm terrified of what's gonna happen here. Sophia. Welcome to the stage, GM.
Speaker G: Hi, guys. I should say ge, because it's evening here, first of all. Yeah, first of all, thank you. You guys are amazing. And this is a great chat room. I don't usually get into rooms because I feel like it's too intense. This is great. But I felt, like, really compelled to get in because I feel like you guys need somebody to bring some sense into this whole that's going on.
Speaker C: Please give us some sense. We need it.
Speaker G: I feel like there should be at least one co host that sort of brings you guys back to reality, because I don't feel like you can be a coach at any level, let alone, like, a five year old, because if anything, you're gonna ruin their chances of actually really becoming good soccer players, because don't even know. Did I just catch the fact that you didn't even know that dribbling was, you know, like, a thing with soccer? And I use the word soccer, obviously.
Speaker C: Because I say football.
Speaker G: European. Yeah, it's sacrilegious to say the word soccer here. They lynch you for that. But anyways, I think I'm the only one voting against this whole idea because I feel like somebody should tell you the real story. You are the worst coach on the planet. I know it's hard, and it's gonna be really painful for a while, but sometimes you need a dream crusher, and that's just me.
Speaker C: Oh, my God. Sophia the dream crusher is my new favorite story arc on this show. Sophia, I cannot thank you enough for actually coming up here. It's been a great joy to read your comments every time you come to the show. So thank you for coming up. And you are absolutely welcome every time. And I will say, I think she did mention that we need a co host to, like, keep it real with us, which is, you know, I would say normally Des his job, but Des only shows up for one third of the episode, so I think it's absolutely needed. So I can't thank Sofia enough. Chamber, what are your thoughts here? I think she, she makes some really good points. I'm not going to lie.
Speaker A: This. I mean, she's not wrong. I mean, the only thing taking all that into consideration is AI advanced enough to move the needle.
Speaker C: Yeah. So that's it. This is really, this is really a technical experiment, right? This is not a question of we all go. We're all going into this knowing that you are a subpar option for a youth soccer coach or soccer coach at any level. It's a real skill on, is AI advanced enough to, to bring you from zero to one as a soccer coach? Right? Is that what we're going with? So this is a science experiment more than anything.
Speaker A: It really is.
Speaker C: I am just dying. And by the way, Mackie, if you're out there listening, which I think you are, please make the Sofia minute long clip. The clip for today's episode. I think it is the most impactful one of the day, bringing chamber down a peg after Sophia. I'll let you have your rebuttal here. Then we'll throw over to one in a million.
Speaker G: Yeah. I think even with any, whatever technical thing you throw at this, it is just not going to help in this case, let's just say. But that's obviously just my opinion. But I think even Elon Musk will agree with me on this one. It's just an impossible thing to achieve.
Speaker C: This is. I'm loving this. Sophia the dream crusher coming in hot. Chamber, are you the type of person that's like a chip on the shoulder type of guy. Like, will, this. Is this motivating you? Is this feedback motivating you?
Speaker A: Locker room five.
Speaker C: The greatest five year old coach.
Speaker A: This is.
Speaker C: Yeah. So I can see you walking into the locker room and just playing this clip for the kids and being like, don't let me down. We are going to do this. We're taking this all the way to the championship. 14 games and an entire playoffs. Orange slices optional. Let's go 14 and.
Speaker A: Oh, baby. That's 14 and 14 and bust.
Speaker C: This is. This has been one of my actual favorite episodes in a while. One in a million. Jump back in here. First of all, I need to ask, do you believe Sophia, saying that? Chamber. This is an actual impossible task.
Speaker D: So Sophia is dropping knowledge bombs on exactly why it's european football and american soccer. I'm like, make sure the kids have fun. Like, let's get out there. She's like, no, we're gonna go out there and coach the shit out of them, and they're gonna be badasses at five years old.
Speaker C: Yeah, actually, that is a fucking fantastic point. Actually. It really makes a lot of sense now. I think that's a fantastic point.
Speaker D: So, uh, great knowledge bombs on that. And then, uh, the technology part, someone said that, and it reminded me. So I've got one girl in softball, and, uh, one of my boys in baseball right now, one of the head coaches uses an app called team Snap, which I fucking love. So the hardest part about being the head coach is all the bullshit. So you have to text everyone when a game gets rained out or if a game gets rescheduled, all the dumb shit that you don't want to have to handle. Like, it's one thing if you're assistant coach, you show up and hang out with the kids and all that. But if you're, like, the head coach, everyone's texting you, calling you, so that sucks. But this team, snap. I'm sure there's others out there, but one of the coaches used it this year, and I was like, wow, that is great. Because he doesn't have to deal with anything. I just hit the app. It alerts me. It lets me know when anything's going on, who's in charge of snacks, all the bullshit you don't want to deal with. So I would definitely incorporate some sort of technology for that.
Speaker C: If you're heading it looks like chamber, can we build you a coaching?
Speaker A: It looks like we have something already planned out in the email. I'm just looking at the email now. It does. It does recommend getting this. It's called power up, which I think is similar to what you're describing here.
Speaker C: I would rather make you our own. Yeah, I would rather make you your own here. And it's. It. And it's gonna, like, auto generate text to video, and it's just. You're gonna tell people that the game is rained out, and it's gonna generate a video of you ripping a dart on your porch, telling people not to show up today.
Speaker A: I like it. I think that's the way to go.
Speaker C: Right? We're throwing over to. We're wrapped as we wrap up here, by the way. I don't think we've had this level of engagement on a show in quite some time. So, I mean, more content. This, I think, you know, like, what's the next version of this? That we. Can.
Speaker A: We just leave it to the podcast and gods, they. They bless us with bounties occasionally of.
Speaker C: This is why I have so much fun on this show, though, is like, we. We don't. You're you. This is a quote from you at about 335. Is there any news going on? We need content for the show in the world. And my response was, and then we.
Speaker A: He actually provides some actual good talking points today in the world.
Speaker C: He also referred to us as his two dads. That's nice. Shouts to crocs uh, Joe, get in here. You're. I have a feeling you're gonna comment on football versus soccer. And I also think you're probably. You strike me as somebody who has coached your children, but wouldn't do it again. I would not coach my children because I know my personality. And, yeah, I love my kids, but I don't love other people's kids. So fair. So, you know, I'm not going to play favorites with my child. That's a chamber thing, though, too. Well, this is. This is why I'm coming to chamber right now. Chamber. If you take this on, man, I mean, good luck to you, but the most important things. And listen, you've talked about some lofty goals here. You're. You're heading for the canadian national team. You guys actually have some good players. But what I would say is, you. You need to. You. Suarez. Great. Sophia. Great. Millie. We're all great. Nobody actually talked about the two most important things that a modern day coach has to have. And that is, what is your coaching style and what is your fashion style?
Speaker A: This is a great question, because I was. I was going to bring this off.
Speaker C: Cardigans. Yeah. Pep is liking cardigans, right? Uh, great. Arson Wenger. Uh, Sir Alex Ferguson. Um, suits. Okay. You have somebody like Marco Bielsa. Okay. Like the coaches coach. People travel from all across the world to go and learn from Marco.
Speaker A: Okay?
Speaker C: Right. We're talking pep, we're talking Pochettino.
Speaker A: We got an email back, by the.
Speaker C: Way, man wears chain, smokes the entire game, and sits on a bucket. That's his style. And they literally started selling buckets. So how are you playing and what are you wearing while you're doing it? And I really feel like if you go with the bucket, with the pot logos on the side, this could be a excellent branding opportunity for you with the five year olds. This is interesting out there. Also. Corporate sponsorship opportunity. Exactly. I mean, because who doesn't want to have their kid coach by the pot king while he's sitting on a bucket advertising the pot? So I feel like it could be a beautiful synergy, and I really hope it works out. And I can't wait till I see you at, I don't know, maybe, like three World cups from now, you'll be coaching Canada.
Speaker A: Maybe that's about all it.
Speaker C: Absolutely. Like, 50 of you in Canada anyways. So true. Yeah.
Speaker A: Like, a good chance.
Speaker C: The fashion point is so odd. You need to know exactly what your style is going to be. Maybe we could. Yeah. Yeah. Tommy Bahama. Exactly. You. I was. I actually was going to post that up top today, and I just got away from me. But the Tommy Bahama season is upon us. I think that might be your style. All right, we. We are wrapping this up shortly. I do want to web three stoop and cap before we go. We'll shut it down with pain. And then if we can get to back to Sophia for the final thoughts here. I think web three stoop. What is going on?
Speaker H: What's up? What's up, everybody? I was not expecting a mint condition podcast to be about coaching soccer, but here we are talking about AI and soccer. And I'm just saying chamber. I mean, that's true. Okay, football, soccer, whatever you want to call it anyway. Chamber. I'll just say this. Whatever you lack in coaching skills, you can make up for with AI tools. So just, like, get out some video, start having the AI analyzer. Tell them, look, you're not going pro. I would just rip the band aid off early. Start using the statistics. There's a lot of. There's a lot of, like, weird nuance in sports. I think, like, the later in the year that you're born, the better or the earlier in the year, typically, like, most pro NHL players statistically are born within like January to march because they're actually.
Speaker C: Oh, this is out.
Speaker A: I agree. I agree with this.
Speaker C: This is how you need to recruit for your team.
Speaker A: Exactly.
Speaker C: This is accurate.
Speaker I: My youngest is angry at us for having her in June. She. She is like a few days too old, so she has to play up and she is upset with her mother and I for not planning her, her birth.
Speaker D: Better red shirt.
Speaker E: As she should be. As she should be.
Speaker C: I'm with web three stoop here. Use these advanced analytics to draft your team. Only take children that are born within birth months that turn pro. Historically, I think that's. Chamber you on?
Speaker A: Absolutely. I've been on this theory for a long time. Even in schooling, I think earlier in the year is always better. January, February, March. You know, you're just more advanced so that this all checks out for me.
Speaker C: All right.
Speaker H: I was the youngest in my grade, but I was smarter than everybody. So chamber just saying.
Speaker C: Still are stupid. Still are. Always has been. Back to let's go to cap pain and then we'll close it down with some real quick.
Speaker F: I.
Speaker I: Maybe someone caught on it, hit on it earlier. But I think for what it's worth, Chamber would be a fantastic kids soccer coach for the kids from this age up until. I don't know if all the way through, maybe up until like the teenage years, like maybe through twelve, you'd be phenomenal with the kids. My concern, and this is a real concern, as your friend is, I don't like you may blow a gasket at a ref. Like, I have a friend, an in real life friend bunch. He's in that other, that other thread of ours. He made a child referee cry at a game. He lost his cool and made a child cry who after a bad call. So I could just. Like when. When that was my concern. Not with the kids, but rather the other kids who are referees. Like you. You could like it might be like childhood trauma, like PTSD for the rest of their life.
Speaker C: It was actually, I believe, Webster, sorry, one in a million who said that if chamber does this, one of the things he has to make sure he does not do is yell at the 14 year old referee.
Speaker I: Yes, exactly. So one in a million gets it. Like you've been there. Like, this isn't like an exaggeration either. Like, I have seen multiple people go off on children because they're referees. Like it's. It's one of the most. Like you think you're embarrassed by web three sometimes. Wait till you see someone yell at a 14 year old.
Speaker C: Gauge your. Gauge your likelihood to blow a gasket at a 14 year old.
Speaker A: See, my instincts telling me, like, I would probably go more subtle in my, like, crippling of you.
Speaker C: You would like slash his tires in the parking lot? Just like, just like, kind of like slices?
Speaker A: Yeah, more like they just say things under my breath as he runs by. You know what I mean? Like very subtle, you know, mind games for the youth. I feel like that that's where you win.
Speaker C: You'd like post it.
Speaker A: You'd can't bruise the mind as I always.
Speaker C: You would like surface embarrassing pictures of his childhood.
Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker C: Social media, you know, some real mental.
Speaker A: Weren't you still pissing the bed a couple years ago?
Speaker C: Oh, geez. All right, we, we do have to wrap this up. Let's go. Pain. And if Sophia has a final comment because she wins the day.
Speaker B: Pain, of course. Yeah. I don't, I don't know a ton about football, but I do. I have heard a lot of takes from Joe, and as far from what I've heard from Joe, I just know that Tottenham and Chelsea are apparently the best teams and the MLS will always be superior. So if you're going to root for anybody, do that. Strictly sports in the comments. No, please don't joke. You can block dj network. Strictly sports. He gave some great advice. Have the parents rotate snacks. And I'm sure they'd love to get all these little kids snacks, so just have a little sign up list there. And then the last thing.
Speaker C: Three dozen wings at halftime.
Speaker B: Yes, the last thing. I was truly fearful of what Sophia would say on the mic. And I can say I haven't laughed that hard in a while. That was truly amazing what she came up and said.
Speaker C: So it was fantastic. It was, it made my day because, you know, she is a. When she, she shows up, she's a regular contributor down in the comments and they always make me laugh. So I'm super happy that Sophia came up today. And, and Sophia, if you're still around, you have the final word here today. It has been an honor having you up here and giving the hard truths to chamber that some of us did not. And Sophia, we'll kick it to you and then we'll close it down.
Speaker G: Wow. Thank you, guys. It's great to be here. Thank you for giving me the mic. That's very brave of you. We don't hear too much. We don't hear enough of Joe because I just love that voice. Um, and just to be a. Through a dream crusher no fashion sims will help you coach. So please stay away from anything that has to do with soccer.
Speaker C: Thank you. Wait, we need the, uh, hold on. Where's the, where's the applause button?
Speaker B: That's awkward.
Speaker A: I got it right here.
Speaker C: No adidas. I already hit it. It didn't work. There you go. The no Adidas track neon green tracksuit will help you coach is the literal.
Speaker A: Okay, so literally the colors for my daughter's teams are neon green and.
Speaker C: Oh, you got to get that ape thing. Yeah, you got to get it.
Speaker A: Yeah, like I gotta get a neon green track Adidas track suit.
Speaker C: Some of my favorite ideas today before we shut down, one of them is this needs to be a recurring segment now on the show where we're gonna do, we're gonna get updates, weekly updates.
Speaker A: And, well, we can do it on Fridays for sure. Cause I think Thursday's game day. Okay, Tuesday's practice day. Thursday's game day.
Speaker C: That's perfect. So we can plan your practices on maybe even Mondays and get your weekend day updates. And then the other plan I liked was von and saying we should be live listening to your practice one day. We're definitely going to have to do that. And I think, I think you do need to really consider what your fashion is going to be on the sidelines. Even though Sophia says no fashion will help you, which I think is right. AI cannot.
Speaker A: No fashion can hurt me.
Speaker C: That's right. But this has been an amazing, amazing, amazing show. I had so much fun. It's a great Friday show. Uh, chamber, any final thoughts here before we get going?
Speaker A: No, I just received the next steps.
Speaker C: Oh yeah, email.
Speaker A: So I'm going to be completing this this evening.
Speaker C: And, uh, what are the next steps.
Speaker A: To fill out a form? Yada, yada, yada. A lot of basic stuff.

Have a wonderful weekend. Don't forget to check out all the other dj network shows tomorrow. We have Saturday morning cartoons at 09:30 a.m. eastern time and that's going to do it for us. Until next time, stay mint.
