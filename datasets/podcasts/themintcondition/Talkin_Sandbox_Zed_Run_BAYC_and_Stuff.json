I was saying, I was saying prior to recording, I think that's a good meetup spot if you're a single person, maybe for those looking for that additional incentive to get the vaccine, I think if you're single, I think it's a good place to meet people, you know?"

We'll get to get all of our sandbox questions out, but maybe we should do that show live and get people's sandbox questions right in the chat. We could potentially do that as well. But, but, Des, I actually had a work conference call today at 09:00 so I was geared up and ready to go. I had participated in one of the drops before, so I kind of knew what was going to happen. And, you know, if you blinked, you missed it. It was gone. There was 900, I think, total parcels, 400. 400 premiums and, or maybe it was 900 regular, 400 premiums and some estates and it was gone within 30 seconds. Des, you were able to snag one, right?"

So I just went to another one that was adjacent, bought it, paid for the extra gas. I think that's the tip that saved me today. Paid the extra gas, and was able to secure it. So I have yacht club for front property. Oh, yeah, property. And I already have an idea of what I want to do with the parcel. So I'm super excited."

And, you know, at that time, they were going through a previous public sale, and things were sitting, I mean, for days, weeks, you know, they made it through the entire sale. They made it through the entire sale without selling premium lands. And then they had to sell them for the cheap. They had to convert premium lands to just normal lands and sell them for cheap. That did sell out really quickly, but this is a whole different experience. I mean, they listed the premium lands and everything sold within, like you said, 10 seconds. That is exponential demand."

Like, if you want to find like a really cool looking ape, don't get me wrong, all apes look great, but if you want to find a really good looking ape, it's hard as hell to track one down right now.

Which is cool.

Right.

However, I think you're going to see a change potentially from what happened last time. And because they sent out a survey, they sent out an email survey. So if you have your email hooked up to your Zed account, they sent out a survey in which you could kind of vote on what you thought their biggest change needed to be. Now, in fairness to their survey, I thought it was kind of bogus that you couldn't pick more than one option. Like you literally had to pick, do you want a private link or do you think we should do this? And, you know, there was probably a couple things that you could have, you could have chosen from there, but I think, you know, there are going to try to make improvements about it being fair for everybody to grab a horse.

Seven times that they could breed. And the female horses had two offspring that they could produce in a breeding cycle that is being cut down.

I think, you know, the thing with the way it was currently is, I mean when you think about the just sheer number of horses that are out there now and the number of people playing the game, that number is going to rise exponentially with two and seven.

So I think he can still do that. You know when I was talking to him, he said, well this just slows me down. It just slows him down. So des, what are your opinions on this?

At the end of the day, I still think it comes back to, you need some sort of fatigue or shelf life to these half life to these horses, because, great, you slowed down the growth this one month. Well, next month it gets still exponential and then the next month is still exponential. So it slowed it down, but eventually it's still going to become overrun with, with too many horses. So you really need to figure out the fatigue aspect and what you're going to do long term about that. Because if you added a fatigue, if you added, hey, horses are really only good for six to twelve months, then that solves all your volume issue, right. Because it's just a constant churn of horses."

You know, people are happy to make three, four x on a horse. They don't need, you know, five x right out the gate. So that usually is what causes a little dip in the average cost or average sale of a genesis. And then you see a climb, because inventory dries up, people race it. That's what I love about this space is, you know, these assets just increase in rarity as people race them. So an unraced horse is just going to become more rare as time goes on."

The possibility that when you do exclusive to Genesis from a female side, you keep exclusive. So that's a double bonus there. And then, obviously, you're you. When you're not, you're breeding down to elite males, which is, I think, a good strategy, especially. Especially early. Like, if you can be breeding elites now, I think that's a big advantage, because everybody, starting now, is going to be breeding elites at the same time. So if you can.

But, yeah, and then I wasn't going to do it. And then my brother called me and he had bought some and I'm like, all right, well, now I got it. So that's funny. So, okay, you saw it on doofy stream. Like, I think a lot of the Zed guys were involved in buying some of these. So, you know, there was like three tiers of these characters you could buy, all for different prices. I think the top tier cost like $230 a character. So I bought a couple of those. And then they have the guilds. And so the guilds were interesting because I think you can only create a guild if you own these, right? So, like, there was three different, three or four different tiers of the guilds. And, and if you own the guild, you can create it and kind of lead the guild and you actually get a cut of a percentage of all the, you know, I guess, commission, I guess, of what it costs people to actually forge stuff in the game, which is cool. And it says, you know, they have 130 person or 130,000 people waitlist. But, yeah, I mean, it looks pretty interesting here. So, um, Doofy's to blame, they say a lot of people in the chat."

So it seems these projects with existing fan base and following plus, you know, the NFTs pick up and or go crazy at launch. I think that's totally true. That's why sandbox is so interesting, because you're bringing in a other existing fan bases and, you know, you're building like this web of FOMO, I would say. Right. The web of FOMO."

So hopefully I can get that working to give people just maybe some more information, because I don't know of anything like that that exists. And what ends up happening is you just see these things as they're being dropped. And, you know, maybe, I hope maybe a little more pre planning on what you can buy into and do a little research prior. So hopefully I'll have that launched soon.

It was the opposite thing that happened to bored apes. Right? Like, the floor fell out instead of slowly rising.
