Gen X didn't care enough. They were too jaded, raised by the boomers. And I think millennials, especially kind of the older ones, we've grown up in a time where we transitioned more so than a lot of generations, from the analog to the digital. We've dealt with old school, eighties and nineties problems, and I think we're better for it. I think we're more adjusted. And then you got the newest generation, your Gen Z's and whatnot. They don't know how good they have. And I feel like we still know what it was like to how awesome it is now. And I think we carry ourselves that way.

I think what the millennials do that's significantly different than previous generations is that they actually are more willing to sort of pay more taxes if it means it's better off for other people. They're willing to give more charities, they want to force businesses that align with themselves. They care about the earth.

I was thinking that today actually is like, we are, we're gonna be walking around like, check out my shoe. I went to a family birthday party yesterday and I wore my artifact ar hoodie that I've been super excited about. And I mean, I basically just got dunked on by my family for 4 hours. And I was like, let's see your special hoodie. Okay, thank you, grandma. It was grandma's birthday. It was, yeah, it was grandma's birthday and she dunked on me for an hour about my, my magic hoodie. Like, back in my day, we wore wool like men. And I was like, oh, well, this is, this, this has a picture show up when I scan it. It was quite a time. And then that was it. So that, but point being, I think we'll be, you know, we'll be suited and booted for, for conference season with these artifacts shoes. I did want to get to our third or our other web three poll here because I want to ask des his opinion on this up top. There was some frank action yesterday in the Twitter world, as there usually seemingly always is, and it caused an uproar about, you know, lots of back and forth on one. Is it actually something that's going to happen to what your thoughts might be on doing this as a brand and especially Des, you as a project founder and owner? The poll up top is, will cease and desist actually stop derivatives of ute's? As in, like, will they actually proceed doing this? There was a whole thing about Frank coming out and saying he's going to send cease and desists out to any derivatives. Des, what's your take on one derivatives in general to cease and desist.

But, uh, you know, it was interesting, I was on a space earlier today, and I don't know if I want to fact check this, but someone was saying that they cco the minions ip. Are you like universal did that? Which I thought is a crazy. I like, I want to investigate more on that, but, you know, I'm. I think it distracts, if anything. That's why you've seen some of the brands like Moonbirds and, and AJt's gobble town go to. Go to CC Zero. I, I, I think it's a distraction. So overall, I don't think it's necessarily something we need to be talking about. Is sending cease and desist for derivatives. That's, that's my take chamber."

So is it, is that happening with other projects? If so, then yes, that's fine. If not, then it's a little, it's a little weird."

        "speaker": "G",
        "text": "Hey, thank you. Well, I actually have seen this multiple times. I've actually been around this space, my educator in this space. I know it's ironic because I come with jokes and a female face and a female voice all in one. I know that's strange, but I've seen this a lot in the years I've been here. And what I can say is that sometimes they're successful. When they send that first cease and desist, they send it out, open sea just immediately will take it down. Now, if they start fighting though, right? So say the derivative says, no, we deserve to be here, we want to stay here. Maybe we've made x amount of changes. To say that does play a factor. That is a factor to consider as well. How much change did they make? Did they flip it, etcetera? And is it notably different in any kind of way? All these things play into that, but if the derivative comes in and tries to find to get back on there, a lot of times it's easy for them to actually get back on there if they've made any significant change at all or if they get their own attorney. So just picking how hard they fight. They can oftentimes get relisted or they can still use other platforms, like looks fair and so forth. Again, it depends on how much the main project really fights. To have those things taken down and what differences those derivatives, you know, put in to ensure that they weren't exactly 100% identical. Now say they get it all the way down. Right. It's really hard because what ends up happening is there needs to be a litigation about it so oftentimes as avoided because we know where are you really going to find the people who put that up? Can you really stop them from continuously putting it up? So it's a battle to get them down and to stay down. That's one problem. You get one down and 50 more pop up simply because it got all the attention of the first one going down. Because pulling one down does gain, you know, it does gain traction and notice. So then people are like, oh, I'm going to do it too. And the next thing you know, there's five more pop up. You know, it's kind of like weeds. You spray one down and 50 more pop up."

Is super important to you. You actually even saw Frank tweet out afterwards that he got on a spaces that the project he was concerned about founder was on and they talked it out. And what was interesting was he kind of asked him, well, why are you even doing a derivative? And he said it's hard to get attention as a brand new, completely original project, which is true. So there's some merit to it. I think you're spot on about like changing it enough chamber. Did you have some thoughts there? I saw you come off me too."

And so if you're attempting to protect your identity, you're showing to those partners who may not know you as well, that you take that seriously. And also, as chambers said, it's basically, it's cheap. It's cheap press, it keeps you out there. The other thing is, they're very big on autonomization over there. And so once you start to send out those sort of cease and desists, if you're working with in house counsel, it doesn't cost as much as we all think it does. So those are my, my points."

Um, it's weird saying Joan Chamber because you're Joan Chamber, but like, uh, warp Joan Chamber said where it's like, that's the idea is like, you know, they need to show their web two partners, they're defending their ip. Just one. I mean, two things I was going to hit quick is like answering chambers question about, like, bored ape yacht club didn't do this. They actually were going to when wicked bone Club came out last year, which was like this derivative of like, wicked craniums and, and, um, board ape yacht club. And then they found out that their holders were predominantly the people who were buying them to get matches, so they made the decision not to litigate. They only actually have litigated around the rider rip stuff for. Well, one, obviously they probably don't like being called nazis, but the other part is that they are indistinguishable from the actual board apes, which is like a consumer protection issue. So they sort of have to go after them. It's, it's sort of one of those things where people are like, well, Andy Warhol did Campbell soup cans, but you would never assume that a Campbell soup can is actual soup. Whereas the Bourde Bach club derivatives and writer rips could easily be confused and sort of put in that spot. So just worth, we're, you know, kind of answering chambers question as he left the stage, as I was talking. So I get that, but was more of an answer there."

        "text": "Then norm, I just had two other things I wanted to quickly say about cease and desist one. Serving them, though, still serves purpose because it does get them down from open sea while they look at it, at least for a little while. And for a lot of derivatives, it's easy to smash them out when you kill the hype. And that does tend to kill the hype pretty well just to get them down, delisted for any amount of time. The second thing is that for a project that's a derivative, to survive, it has to actually do something beyond, beside just provide the same art that's already there. And so oftentimes I find that derivatives for me are difficult for me to personally invest in due to the fact that oftentimes there's not a structured business plan. They're not really doing anything. And I know that hype, as quick as it rises, three times as fast will it fall. And I know that. So I tend to not really invest in those personally. So I just want to throw that out there as well."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that's spot on, especially the first point about making it. I think that's kind of what moonbirds did, right, where they kind of came out publicly said they were going to smash them all and they slowed down a little bit because there was a million moon birds, ones right off the bat. But I totally also agree about the hype. You know, if you're, it's one thing if you're going to be flipping these into momentum for the purpose of flipping them into momentum, but I think it's dangerous to try to, you know, long term hold a derivative outside of, of maybe just, you know, a cheap community that you want to be in circles. Norm Hunter and then we got to wrap this thing up already. Look at us. Holy cow."

    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I think there's definitely some that have survived, right? And they've done their own thing. And if you can create a. I think there, you know, some things around derivatives are interesting in the sense that like, you know, they often, the ones that do survive come at like the derivative of something that is priced out to a normal person, right? So like, I feel like you've seen some bored apes, derivatives survive for one reason or another and it's because people want to be part of that but can't afford to have an ape or a mutant. So I think there's some valid things there. If I they actually can build a team and like space Kitty said, some original content and momentum of their own. But your point about the ute's derivatives that came out before the ute's archdrap is funny and I don't, I saw that going around yesterday and I actually don't know how to feel or approach that question, which is interesting.

My first question to it was, what jokes would you tell in a roast of someone who wears Tommy Bahama shirts? And the response was, as a language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of generating jokes or participating in a roast. My function is to assist users with providing accurate and helpful information based on the input given me. So then I tried to press on and I said, I just went right back at it. What jokes would you tell in a roast of someone who wears Tommy Bahama shirts, they responded, you know, the same thing. But then they added, roasting someone based on their clothing choices is not kind or respectful behavior. And I would not condone it. My purpose is to help users, not to provide material for hurtful or offensive behavior. So chamber OpenAI is really looking out for you here. And I just wanted to let you know that somebody out there has your back because I was trying to get them to roast. Oh, wait. I then went further. What are some funny observations about Canadians? And it wouldn't give. It wouldn't. It wouldn't let me have that one either. So I am actually totally bearish on chat. Yeah, the chat bot here bunch."
