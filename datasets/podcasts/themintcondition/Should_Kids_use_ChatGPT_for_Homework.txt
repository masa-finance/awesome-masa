Speaker A: Hello, and welcome to the mint condition. I am bunchu alongside of my one esteemed colleague and co host today, chamber. Chamber. How you doing, buddy?
Speaker B: No, des, today we'll have to make two. I have a question for you. I see dow. I see Dow Jones listening. I have an it's always sunny question for you. Oh, I saw a tick tock today. I was working really hard, and I saw a tick tock, and the question was, out of the gang. Who is the worst member? Who is the worst person?
Speaker A: Oh, like, who's the worst person?
Speaker B: And I had an opinion, man, that's tough. I had an opinion, and I stand by it, and I want to get your. Your opinion.
Speaker A: I think the worst person. I think there's two.
Speaker B: There's two candidates.
Speaker A: I think it. I think it comes down to Dennis or 100%. Those are the two.
Speaker B: Those are the two options.
Speaker A: And I actually think I would go with Frank.
Speaker B: I agree with you. Okay, good. Because the person on TikTok said Dennis was, and I could see how you can get to that conclusion, but off the top of my head, I could name you, like, things that Frank's had. Has admitted to doing that's far worse. Like, I was watching one the other day, and Frank admitted it was. I mean, he's admitted on multiple occasions that he's run a sweatshop right off the bat. A sweatshop. He's admitted to feeding cats and humans in a stew to the workers of that sweatshop.
Speaker A: Well, I mean, if you put it in a stew, it's fine.
Speaker B: It's fine. It's stew. You toss it in the stew. You just toss that in the stew. And then with Dennis, it was. It. It's only hypotheticals. Like, it's only, you know, there's a possibility he could be a serial killer. We're not 100% sure.
Speaker A: No, I'm with you. I think I'm glad that we landed on the serial killer.
Speaker B: It makes me feel a lot better. Okay, cool. All right. That's all.
Speaker A: That was our always sunny nonsense. Plug for the day. If you have not watched always sunny in Philadelphia, it is actually a requirement to listen to this show. So it's a big part of.
Speaker B: It's a big part of the show.
Speaker A: It's a big. It's a big part of both of our personalities. I would say we are. We are those guys. But if. If you're here and haven't listened to always sunny and are listening for, you know, web three content or other general nonsense, we will get into that shortly here. But first, all different kinds of ways that you could check out other Djen network content. Just going to talk about a few. Um, we have a newsletter. If you go to dgen.net work, dgen.net work, you can sign up for our newsletter that goes out once a week with all the crazy stuff that goes on in the web three space. Plus all of our awesome content that you may have missed throughout the week. Also, all new articles coming out all the time on our website, djen.net work. We have a full roster of shows now. I think we're up to nine different shows between the everything that we're putting out. So Monday through Friday, we've got you covered all day long. Coffee with captain, nft lunch break, nft night shift, mint condition. Three times a week now, alpha afternoons. The new sports show DJ D. What is it? Dspn? I don't know what sports. Yeah, I don't know what SPN degenerate. Well, you know, it's like, like a playoff.
Speaker B: I don't know what ESPN.
Speaker A: ESPN stands for.
Speaker B: I just.
Speaker A: It's sports sports network.
Speaker B: What's the e, though?
Speaker A: ESPN entertainment and sports Network.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think I know. Look it up, don't look it up. That's what ESPN said. You're not allowed to look it up. I think, by the way, we do. We, we may not have debt today.
Speaker B: Steve definitely knows what it stands for.
Speaker A: Oh, we're getting the bingo card.
Speaker C: I know I was resisting because I'm like, I know it's a bingo card item, but I just, I think it's entertainment and sports program or programming network. One of those two, I think. I don't know why, but I'm almost positive the p is program.
Speaker A: I was gonna go with. I was gonna go with pass.
Speaker B: That's always a good choice over potato. Thanks, Steve. You know what? Whether you're right or whether you're wrong, I believe I feel that you're right, and that's really all that matters.
Speaker A: Well, what I was going to say before this, before we hit one of the bingo card items, was we may not have Des today, but there are TMC prop bets that he did post lines for in the dj war room. TMC prop bet thread. We don't know what they are. So at the end of the show, I'm going to go down there and check them out and see if we hit any of them. But, uh, throughout our natural, uh, chatting today. So, um. But yes. And, and we have that, like I said, plethora of all those other shows. And this show every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on Twitter spaces at four to five eastern. It was kind of weird doing this show on west coast time. Being on West coast time in general was weird trying to get, you know, a hang of when all of our content was, and I got to say, like, shouts one, to all the people who show up from the west coast to coffee with captain because one, it is super early, but two, it's like, I'm so used to coffee, like, covering the majority of my morning and like, when it ends, it's 10 30, 11:00 or whatever, 1010 15 and it's taken up a lot of my morning. And on the west coast, it was done by, you know, like 738 o'clock. And I was like, wild. I was like, what the hell do I do now? I'm just waking up. Yeah. So it was, it was kind of wild to do all of this content on West coast time. I also, I mean, no, hate to the west coasters, but, like, not my jam for, like, sports scheduling either. I don't like the, you know, 05:00 p.m. starts for primetime games and stuff. So that's pretty terrible. But yeah, I would say that the best time zone is personal preference. Best time zone central time would be.
Speaker B: I agree. I'm with you on that would be my. Yeah, you got a little bit of everything. You don't have to stay up till 02:00 in the morning watching Laker games like I do. It's ridiculous.
Speaker A: That's right.
Speaker B: It's not fun.
Speaker A: That is right. But anyway, we got some, we got some segments here today I think we're gonna do. So we got suss or bus, we got news or. Nah, we've got the next big thing and the best thing we heard and saw all week. So we've got a lot to talk about here. If you want to come in, come up and chime in, please request. And we will gladly get you up here to chat with us, but chamber anything exciting going on for you in the NFT world since we talked last time. We, you know, we talked Friday, but mostly, I think ces and your, you know, your procedure. Yeah. Dominated. We did not. Yeah, we didn't go back to like, the memeland's captain conversation, which we had a lot on Wednesday. So I'd love to hear start off with your take there and see.
Speaker B: I mean, with Memelands, it's kind of, you know, I don't know where we're at right now. I think it was 5.85 floor for the unrevealed. Currently.
Speaker A: It's currently 5.45.4.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is kind of what we talked about. I know there was a big expectation that these would hit, you know, on the higher side of single digits, if not double digits.
Speaker A: They opened around seven.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I don't think we saw any eight sales. We definitely saw some early sevens.
Speaker B: Okay, so there's some seven sales. We're at about five and a half right now. When is the reveal on this? I heard it was a staggered reveal for a couple of weeks or something like that. Is that right?
Speaker A: Man, I don't know. It sounds like it's actually gonna take a while. It's like a three part thing that involves the game and stage. I don't know. I don't think it's gonna go much further from here. Like yesterday when coffee or when captain was doing the football show, he, like, started off talking about how he was kind of looking to make some moves to pick one up and how it was. That was at 4.8, so they kind of touched that area. Somebody said they maybe like four or five at the very least. Now they're. They're back up, but scooped back up a little. So maybe they found. Did you scoop up?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Are you, are you going to, do you have any intention, you know what?
Speaker B: I've been listening to a lot more spaces as of late, and I don't know who said it.
Speaker A: Now is this because, is this because you're interested in the content or are you doing spaces research for details?
Speaker B: Well, I'm usually it's because I'm hosting through the dj and handle.
Speaker A: Oh, so then you're definitely not interested?
Speaker B: Definitely not interested in the content, but I will. You know, some of these shows get some pretty smart, you know, some pretty smart listeners that come up to the stage and say some smart stuff. And what I'll do is I'll, I'll hear that and then I'll. And then I'll go into our show and spit it off as my own.
Speaker A: Oh, that's perfect.
Speaker B: But somebody, I forget who it was.
Speaker A: Way to blow the lid off of our last five years of content.
Speaker B: Shout out to ledgercast.
Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker B: But shit, what was I saying? Now, see, I got completely off track.
Speaker A: Sorry. You were going to regurgitate someone else's.
Speaker B: What they had said was, I think in general, what they like to do is when you have these big hyped mints and they're not necessarily participating at the very beginning, like, maybe they missed out on whitelist or whatever. What they'll do is they'll wait like a month and see where the project is then, and then kind of get back into it, do a little research into it, see if they're on track, if they've added anything to kind of their roadmap or, you know, you know, kind of get a better, a better gauge on what they're doing and then they'll get in there at typically a lower price point. And I thought that was good advice. I thought that was smart.
Speaker A: So wait, repeat that to me.
Speaker B: So basically, if you don't get in early, you know, whether it be like just minting it straight up. So say we'll use, we'll use captains for this example. So I didn't get the mint. What this person said is, let's wait you, you know, three, four weeks, let the market kind of dictate the price, and then what'll happen. It takes away the, you know, some of those projects that have a huge, you know, hype behind it and kind of fizzle out. Like, was it hape? I was trying to think of the, some of the, some of the ones that just kind of had a huge, huge, huge mint. And then within a week or two, we're basically done. So basically you're getting rid of all those ones and if they're still around in three, four weeks, you can kind of revisit them, make sure they're still on track for what they said they were going to do and then buy at that point. And then that way the chances of getting scammed are much lower and then getting at a better price are much higher as well. And then you're actually doing a conviction play on a project that you think has some, you know, has some future interesting.
Speaker A: I mean, I think that's fair. I'm not doing anything that's pretty.
Speaker B: I'm not doing any of that. Like, that sounds.
Speaker A: You're not, you're not interested in all or are you just not following the sound?
Speaker B: So from it, sound advice, I'm not going to follow it. Honestly, meme land just seems like a, it just seems like a lot to me. It just seems like a lot. It's, it's a lot of moving parts. I gotta have potatoes and MVP's and captains and it's this other, you know, it's this gamified thing. I've been listening to a lot of Memeland stuff and I feel like I've not comprehended what's happening and it just, in my opinion, seems like a lot. And I know myself if I end up purchasing something, I'm not going to be following it properly, and I'm going to miss something, or I'm going to miss an opportunity on the staking or whatever it is. But that's just me.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's fair. I would say that you want. If you're going to hold these assets, you want to participate. Right. So you're either in or out. If you're not just doing a speculative thing, however, you make it sound like it's a bad thing, that there's a lot there for me there.
Speaker B: It's just confusing. I confuse easily. So it's a bad thing.
Speaker A: I mean, I know that. Yeah. I mean, but I would like about it. Yeah. I mean, the more in depth that they create these, you know, stories and things you can do with the assets and things you have to do with the assets, I think the better. Like, you don't want it to turn into, you know, pixel vault, but, you know, you. You want it to have some cohesion. Right. Like, I'm actually impressed with the potatoes floor. It's holding right now at 2.269, which, you know, at the top was, like, three and a half ish. I would say that's pretty good, considering the mint is now done and you need them to stake and stuff. But, like, I was expecting probably a 1.5 ish. What are your thoughts on?
Speaker B: Yeah, I thought the potatoes held really, really well. I agree. I thought they would be in that kind of one and a half, even one east I could have seen them go into. So, yeah, I think. I think whoever ended up picking up a bunch of those, I think you're not that disappointed with, because, I mean, you were definitely taking a chance that the bottom would just fall right out on those, and they didn't. So I feel. I feel that, you know, pretty confident for those, for the people that are holding currently. So that's good.
Speaker A: All right, so no picking up potatoes for you or captain?
Speaker B: Not yet. Not yet.
Speaker A: All right, that's fair. All right, let's, uh. Let's go to hands real quick before we get into some segments. Let's start with Steve. Steve, what's up?
Speaker C: No, I was going to say, like, really, um, reasonable reaction by chamber, I think. And also, like, something that I think is actually a hindrance for a lot of, um, bigger NFT brands. Like you mentioned, pixel vault. That's the one that came to mind, which is, I've tried to dig into meme land a little bit. I don't own any, and I'm like, I don't know if I have the energy to invest, which is okay. You could want to participate in some and not others, but when you think about adoption and people coming in, I think it's a really good point. By chamber of, you're listening to these interviews and you're hearing all these different complexities and you're like, I can't explain this or understand this. It's going to turn people off. So I think it's a really good point that he made there that as he was kind of discussing his in and out, because it's easy to miss things and then I've missed deadlines in complicated projects before and it just gets exhausting.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's fair. So, Steve, what's the right amount? I mean, you want these ecosystems to have some complexity and depth to them, right? But I get what both of you are saying. What's the right amount? Or maybe the other question is like, how do you define what type of, I guess, collector or slash investor you are? Are you not into any of these types of ecosystems that have these layers to them or what?
Speaker C: I mean, I don't know. That's a really good question. And it's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is because a lot of them have been in since the beginning. I don't know. I look at a lot of ones that have at least explainable bite size parts. I don't know, like a proof, an on chain monkey. Those both come to mind immediately, which are complicated, but not so unreasonably complicated that it can't be explained in a, in a relatively easy step. Because I do like the ones that I get to participate in a lot. Like, you don't have to be as sparse as, say, like a bored apes or a doodles, which are a lot more spread out. But I do think that there is, you know, some level of tolerance where you get fatigue over, oh, there's another thing. And I have to do this thing and I have to stake this thing and then go down to this thing and I, it's just, there's so many pieces to it, so it's hard to put your finger on for me, what exactly that level of complexity is. I think if you can't explain it to someone, you know, in a single reasonable, like, five minute conversation, then it's probably a little too much to someone who's in NFTs anyway.
Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think if they're outside of nfTs, you start with the sentence. So there's these potatoes. And then you just lose most people right there because they want the pasta. That's why.
Speaker B: To your point, Steve, like, I think, I think there's just a couple of different types of NFT people, right? There's, there's, you're, you know, people more like me that are looking for, I would say more of a quick flip, you know, short to medium term. And I don't necessarily want to know all the ins and outs of like a big game, but there's a lot of people out there that want to utilize NFTs in a, in a next level kind of way. And these games, like, I think the same people and the same reason I didn't get into like wolf game. Like Bunch, you, you and dads were big in a wolf game. Like, I was just like, oh, that's like, it's too much for me. I'm like, I got it. I gotta, I gotta shear these things. I gotta buy wolves. I gotta buy, I gotta buy all these things. I got my sheep. But you guys were right into it and, you know, made some money. So there was money to be made and there was like a gamification of it where, you know, people like me, I think, are just looking for, oh, it's a frog picture. Oh, it's a picture. People like it. Let's, let's flip it.
Speaker A: That's the depth of your investment.
Speaker C: This is what I get for being like chamber at a very reasonable take here.
Speaker A: Yeah, that backfire.
Speaker B: I love any episode that Steve agrees with me. So this is, this is great.
Speaker A: We do have the, we do have the first poll of the day up. It is related to captains. Are you bullish or bearish on the Memelandhe captains? Go hit us up there and vote. Get your vote in. But yeah, no, I think that's fair. Let's go to Bundy down there.
Speaker B: Oh, before Bundy. Give me 1 second. Bundy, I'm gonna let you speak in just 1 second. Bunch. I don't know if you heard the last one. Bundy was our mvp from two shows ago.
Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: I took a look after the show last week after the Friday show and riggs came out hot. So I, like Bundy won with like 185 laugh reactions.
Speaker A: Riggs did riggs stop?
Speaker B: Riggs came out hot with like 365. Okay. Like nearly tripled. I keep scrolling not to be undone. Bundy comes in with 548 laugh emojis, 100.
Speaker A: Wait, so he's back to back to back.
Speaker B: I thought Riggs had it by a country mile. I went and checked Bundy's numbers. 548, 548 laugh emojis, 41 heart emojis. Four thumbs down and 108 100s.
Speaker A: Man, I gotta tell you to put up those. First of all, we chamber. You should really start keeping a record book now because I think we've now created that this is going to be a thing that goes forward because this is kind of fun. But for a 1 hour show to have almost 600, like total re, almost ten total reactions.
Speaker B: Insane for this. For this. So we did an hour show. We got 32 3244 total reactions.
Speaker A: That's crazy. But Bundy just stuffing the ballot with almost ten reactions per minute, which his, his rpm is just super high. So we'll have to start keeping our own little record book here. But Bundy back.
Speaker D: I demand a recount. I absolutely demand a recount.
Speaker A: Chamber do you have.
Speaker D: I got Riggs number.
Speaker A: So the actual screen.
Speaker B: I got rigs numbers. 310 laugh emojis, 117 clap emojis, 66 heart emojis and one sad face.
Speaker D: I was trying to run it up last show after you mentioned it too and got outdone, Bundy. My God.
Speaker A: Hilarious. Steve's, Steve's going for the all time record, the league record of thumbs downs. I've seen at least, I've seen at least 20 or 30 thumbs downs from Steve in the last two minutes. So we might have to go like by category and keep like a real record book of these because I think this is actually pretty fun. But anyway, we'll go back to Bundy. But the, the two time MVP of TMC Bundy. So you know what's actually really hysterical about this is I hit up a rigs afterwards and I made sure to tell him every time I saw him put up an emoji, I put up two. So you guys have turned this into a game for people who are competitive. And this is going to be fun. I heard riggs, I heard riggs talking on coffee this morning and talking specifically about how competitive he was. So, you know, there's rumors out there that people are botting their spaces and things like that. We're going to have Riggs and Bundy listening in from multiple phones to logged into their same accounts. So they're just spamming the reactions for 60 minutes. I think we've created a pretty fun little game here. We do need to start giving prizes out.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Whether that's, I think, po app or something.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah. Because it's not poep farming. It's actually competition here. So it's fun. But, Bundy, did you have anything to add prior to us. Yes, I did, actually. I want to. I want to call bullshit on chamber and steven in a fun way, not a disrespectful way, but I. You guys are putting together a community that you could literally go in there at any time and ask somebody about the project, and they will give you a full rundown. So I just wanted to call bullshit and wanted to come kick somebody in the ball today. So there goes. Yeah. You could literally go into the dj network war room and write captain's question mark, and five people will tell you everything you need to know before the. Before Bundy can add ten laughing emojis.
Speaker B: It's true. I mean, one technically has to get into the discord first, but.
Speaker A: Well, yeah, well, I mean, you don't. You don't. You don't frequent there very often, but, you know, you should. You're. You're a star. People love you in that.
Speaker B: They do. I'll drop just anything. And people do go, go ham, which.
Speaker A: It's because you've created this mystique about how infrequently you're actually in there. So, like, when I. You do show up, people think there's either one, something going on or, like they're honored to be.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: President. Whatever dumb fucking reason that is. I don't know if we're gonna call it honored. I don't know if we're gonna call it a big.
Speaker B: It's like seeing a bigfoot. It's like you don't see it often. So when you do see, you get excited. But I am in discord, Bunch. You can. You can attest this. I'm in discord most.
Speaker A: Yeah, you've been there most of the day. Oh, yes. In. You're just. I'm not an artiste. Yeah, you're. But see, like, if people only knew what you were doing behind the scenes, they wouldn't make fun of you for not being in the war room so much because you're. You're literally making the entire dj and ship run. You're in every single one of our group chats, always, you know, hustling to get stuff done and make sure everything's running on the right.
Speaker E: You bunch.
Speaker A: What's happening? Sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah. No, no, I forgot. No, no, that's too.
Speaker B: Too much. It's too much. But these people can't handle.
Speaker A: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. All right, we got. We got two more hands, and then we'll go. We had Twitter. We have Twitterbay, eth. Twitter bay. Love it. What you got?
Speaker F: All right, dm everyone. Thanks for having me on. So interesting take because I was just thinking about it where I wanted to buy into a project. It was onyforce and I wasn't sure about it.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker F: A lot has happened since they launched. And this is where I started thinking if a project like the potatoes, for example, Memeland, pardon me, comes up with these intricate like ways of being able to reward holders, right? And reward people who are like first, early adopters, I think the problem is you gamify it so much that it gets so complex for a new person to come in. So even if we talk about mass adoption or not even mass adoption, but like bringing in people to be new holders, where do they begin? Right? You have to start the whole story from the beginning, but it gets so like you start rewarding your holders so much that you're almost like, is it worth getting in right now? I mean, I was thinking about going into sub docs, a couple of others as well, v friends as well. But then the rewards are already out. So yes, there might be something coming up later, but I missed the, I miss the train, right? So now I'm kind of the leftover. I feel like the leftover. And I wonder if they're really thinking about it from a how do I start the game again? Or how do I get people to start the game again and still have fun with the journey that everyone else has taken? And that's kind of why gamifying it has, you know, it's a double edged sword. I mean, to Bundy's point of like Riggs and Bundy adopting the whole like double emoji, right? That's an easy thing to get on the train with because everyone can pick up from somewhere where another person has left off. But here it's a bit hard. And of course, we're talking about you having to spend what, ten eth worth or maybe even more at some point in time to kind of get on that train again or catch up. And I think it may get to the point where it's just going to be too expensive to participate sometimes. And I don't know if they've thought about it.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I think that's kind of, uh, you know, not even just from what chamber and Steve were saying about it being complex from the jump, but I think your point about when new people are coming in, right? Because if Memeland is doing their job, a year from now, they'll still be kind of onboarding new people into their ecosystem and I think your point about, um, like, how complex is it to get started if I'm so far down, if the project or the game or whatever is so far already down the road is a really important one. Not only even just from, like, how expensive is it, right. Which you made the point of which I think is a good one, but also, like, cost in terms of time, as in, like, how long is it going to take me to actually learn about this ecosystem and feel like I have deep enough knowledge to even spend money inside of it? Which I think is a really good point. Um, it reminds me a lot of when we were all getting into Zed run back in the day. Uh, and Zed was like, you know, it, it had been around for two years. It was super easy to onboard somebody new in the sense that all you had to do was buy a horse and enter a race or breed a horse and you get a new one.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker A: Like, that part was super easy as far as what was the game mechanics. But when you look at, like, all the intricacies of the game, of Zed run and, like, class systems and different breeds and all this stuff, you could have spent, as you could have spent hours and hours and hours and people do, understanding the game and the ecosystem. So I think that's an interesting one to, like, call as an example, because there's a balance of, it's super easy if you're just getting in day one, but you can spend a hours and hours and hours kind of, um, really diving into the ecosystem. It's also, um, another good example from price point. Like, you could buy a, you know, $80 horse or a $3,000 horse, and you'll have a different experience each way. But you can get in either way as casual or, uh, you know, intense as you want. So I think, like, that's how projects should be thinking about it. And I think it's important to your point to, to plan that way. Right? And I. Maybe they do, maybe they don't, but I think it's, I think it's a really, really, really good point. I'd be curious chamber, if you have any thoughts there, because I would imagine that resonated with you.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you brought in, you brought up Zed run, and, like, Zed runs kind of like a microcosm of the whole NFt universe. Because I, what I, you know, what I took from that, from what Bay said is, you know, yeah. Like, I think it's okay that there are certain things that are out of reach for the beginner like, if Memeland is, you know, ten eth to get in and it's a little bit more complex and you really got to be focused in on it, I think that's okay. I think that's really good. I think. But you're, I don't think you're going to utilize that as onboarding new people into NFTs. I think that's for somebody a little bit more seasoned that's going to spend a little bit more money, and that's okay. And that's kind of similar to your point where you're saying Zed run, you have your free races, you have your lower tier races, and then you can spend a couple thousand dollars racing horses also. So I think Zed run's a really good example of the entire.
Speaker A: Yeah, but even for, like, the, even from, like, the point of if you're a seasoned NFT person, like Twitter Bay is like, man, should I even get into this project at this point? Because it's so far down the road and there's a lot of complexities there, which is interesting. I think it's important for projects to keep that in mind. Twitter Bay, we'll go back to you for a rebuttal and then we'll throw it to circles.
Speaker F: So to add on to that, I think it's also considering the other side of it, like communication. Right now you have a lot of the newer projects, like the team from Memeland, they're showing up in spaces. They're talking about what's exciting, what's going to happen. But then when you consider it from the idea of a game, essentially, that's what they're creating from all of this, am I going to be able to have that experience again? Am I going to see, I don't mean that the founders have to show up in a space, but it's that communication, that level of communication. Right now, we're getting it in stages, right? So as we're getting it in stages, is it going to happen again? Are they going to start, like, Twitter campaigns again to kind of, like, continue that communication? Or is there going to be some sort of tutorial or manual? Like, this is, I think, something that will help ease that, that burden of, like, expecting the community necessarily to sit there. I mean, of course there may be people, but we're, we're predicting whether those people will still be in the ecosystem or they might be so far ahead that they're just busy with it.
Speaker A: Right?
Speaker F: I mean, everyone's going to eventually drift.
Speaker A: Into something else or something further and you can't. To your point there. Like, it needs to be done by the team and planned out that way too. Like, it's funny, we are having a conversation earlier about and you mentioned, yeah, the community will be there to help, but like it's not the community's responsibility either. Right? Like they're the. It's the team's responsibility to make sure that that part is. Is easy to understand, easy to get in, easy to onboard and like, yeah, you're going to have awesome community members but you can't rely on that. It's. It's got to be at the team level. So I'm totally in alignment with you there. Um, circles. What's going on, man?
Speaker G: Hey, yeah, um, so I was talking earlier in another space and you can kind of. I've got two things when I come up because either something really intellectual or a bit. So this is the bit riggs or Bundy. I didn't expect this to be my first coding challenge, but I will offer. I will take payment for a bot to be made for emojis. Bundy obviously gets a little bit of a discount because he is a co host, but I am accepting payment for a box to be built to spam emojis. Hit me up in my DM's.
Speaker B: Amazing.
Speaker A: That's fantastic. I wonder if it can be done. I'm sure it can. Right? Like the answer for everything.
Speaker G: So I'm not going to get you just chat.
Speaker A: GBT. Please help me write a. If I were trying to get MVP on the mint condition, what would you do? And then let's see what it does. Chamber, did you ask? Yes, chappie GPT something about the main condition the other day.
Speaker B: I did not know. I haven't used it yet. I'm a little nervous.
Speaker A: Oh, who was that tweet from? Was that.
Speaker B: I think it was Mackie. I think Mackie used it.
Speaker A: Yeah, that was me. Oh, that was fantastic. It was. It like, thought we were a movie or something and it just was totally inaccurate. It was fantastic. I'm going to shout out some of these comments that we have here. I, for the first half of the show, leave us a comment, if you wouldn't mind, in that purple little chat bubble down there. Tell us what you think so far of anybody's takes or our own. Talk to us about whatever it is you feel. First of all, Riggs's comment that I posted to the top here, that he's never felt more connected to chamber than he does right now. And he posted the pictures of them side by side, bald and bearded for the win. That is just fantastic. You guys could.
Speaker B: Riggs and I are a couple of bad sunglasses choices away from being real. When you look like us, sunglasses and hats can really dictate what you look like on the political spectrum.
Speaker A: I didn't know where you were going with this. Can you. I'm really intrigued.
Speaker D: I was also wondering where he was going with this. I was about to be like, don't fucking lump me into this bad boy.
Speaker B: Listen, you wear riggs. If you wear the wrong sunglasses, you present yourself in a particular.
Speaker A: What type of sunglasses.
Speaker B: You know, we all know the type.
Speaker A: Kind of that I don't. Can you, like, I don't want to.
Speaker B: At least just like insult.
Speaker A: Comment a picture. Comment a picture of the sunglasses only below chamber.
Speaker D: Like, I'm semi nervous to know because I slightly.
Speaker B: Riggs is like 100%. A third of you people have them. So I don't.
Speaker A: I guarantee I probably have you people.
Speaker B: Yeah, you people. You know, you know the sunglasses you wear. But, yeah, I'll post some pictures.
Speaker A: Now I need to know. Now I need to know what type of sunglasses they are. So crypto pain says that he agrees that central time zone is the best time. Vicki says that we should have roasting PO app. So the PO app allows you to actually come up and roast. I like that. Dow Jones said a couple things here. He doesn't think Frank's the worst. He thinks Charlie is the worst. And it's because Frank loves Charlie. Dennis only loves himself and maybe the Land Rover. He also says it's the implication. So shouts there. It's cap says he googled it. Entertainment and sports programming network for ESPN. Dow then says degenerate sports programming network for us. And the captain's poll right now, 57.7% are bullish on captains and 42.3% say no dice for captains. So anyway, where do we want to. Let's go back to.
Speaker B: I got a note from Mackie here. We need to. We need to pump the bubble.
Speaker A: Yeah, I already did that. So thanks.
Speaker B: I'm looking up redneck sunglasses. Sorry.
Speaker A: Geez. I mean, like, do you pay attention at all? I literally almost hit that perfect transition from, like, mackie just puts things in the chat for the. Just a little peek behind the curtain. Mackie is, is Mackie and v squared are wonderful producers here when we do these spaces. And Mackie will keep us right on track and he'll throw stuff in our little chat and, and just as reminders. And I feel like I'm really good at these transitions so good. That chamber didn't even notice that I did it. And he still had to go back.
Speaker B: I just looked down, I saw the note from Mackey, and I'm sorry. I found the picture, though.
Speaker A: Oh, my goodness. All right, while you're looking for those pictures, one more throw down to twitter. Bay.
Speaker F: I was just going to play the uno card and go back to circles where you talked about the code. But I wanted to ask, does the apple Watch spamming of emojis count?
Speaker A: Ooh, I don't know. Can you listen to spaces on your apple watch? If so, it probably.
Speaker F: It's more of you're able to actually spam. I've seen people, like, literally spam thumbs down and it does it a lot quicker. So I think you get, like, ten in 1 second or something.
Speaker A: Riggs and Bundy on their way to buy apple watches right now. Or riggs, how do you get circles? I'd rather pay circles than buy an apple. Fair enough.
Speaker G: Now I'm conflicted because I'm talking through an apple.
Speaker A: Oh, there you go. So circles. You're already on your way. Riggs is like, man, I'm gonna have to forego buying these next sweet pair of sunglasses so I can go buy an apple watch. And dead.
Speaker D: You know who I am. I'm gonna buy both glasses and a watch.
Speaker A: We got that chamber. Did you find sunglasses under.
Speaker B: I posted under Riggs's tweet.
Speaker A: I'm just under Riggs's tweet. All right, I'm gonna have to go find this. Now. Let's see a couple options. Right under Riggs's tweet. I'm gonna pin it to the top here. I don't see it.
Speaker B: I just posted a bald guy.
Speaker A: Oh, there it is. Hold on. Okay. This guy right here. These are the sun.
Speaker B: Well, those are the time. No, not those ones. Those ones are fine. That was pain, that. Oh, no. Which one do you have? Yeah, those ones. Pain. Put pain. Put some out. That I think are okay. I think those are ray bans. Ray bans are fine. But once you get into those.
Speaker A: When I pinned. Is that the one you're talking about or.
Speaker F: No.
Speaker B: Let'S see yours.
Speaker D: Oh, chamber. First off, no one should ever wear those sunglasses.
Speaker B: All right. As long as we're on the same page.
Speaker A: All right, so, Riggs, you don't have these. Compare. Confirmed. You don't have a pair of these. Confirmed.
Speaker D: I have zero of those. I was just waiting for you to pull out, like, actual glasses. I feel like a normal human being would wear, not just a. And I get to say this. I'm a southerner, not some redneck from the south that's, you know, mowing his lawn.
Speaker B: But I'm telling you, you put those on. I put those on. I'm a changed man. Like, you can't walk around, people look at you different. You know? I'm saying, you have.
Speaker D: I. I know exactly what you're saying. They're expecting. You have your guns in the back, you know? I know. I know the look.
Speaker B: So I. We're very close. It's a. It's a fine line. It's. It's a. It's. I think about this all the time, so, yeah, it's. There's not a lot of looks when it comes to bald and bearded. You know what I mean? So you really gotta.
Speaker A: What's the. I would say what's the optimal bald and bearded like for me? For me?
Speaker B: It's. It's. It's definitely like, like, it's like snapbacks, hoodies, and, like, glasses, like, sunglasses that.
Speaker F: Are basically the general.
Speaker B: Yeah. You want to be like, like, hipster. You want to lean more hipster than hillbilly. You know what I mean?
Speaker A: You do a good job of that in this LinkedIn photo. Or what? Or. No, that's your dj network. You've got. You've got a hipster look going on there, I think.
Speaker D: By the way, I'm throwing. I'm putting you out there right now on. On air. Technically. That website, when you first see your name, has your moon.
Speaker B: I know. I. We're updating it.
Speaker A: Oh, wait, mine, too, probably, doesn't it? Yeah, I definitely don't want to be.
Speaker B: A bunch, don't forget to stop it.
Speaker A: Just kidding.
Speaker B: Bunch, don't forget to plug the chat bubble, if you could.
Speaker A: Thanks. Perfect. Thank you. Hold on. I did want to say, just looking at the comments, speaking of chat bubble, crypto pain also posted another tweet here that says that you can't ask chat GPT to write full essays anymore. So I guess there's some tweaks here that I guess can't allow you to. To do your homework with it. Maybe, but that's interesting. Maybe we'll ask chappie chibi t how to do intros for this show next time. But chamber. Did I tell you I met Kevin Rose?
Speaker B: No. Is that, like, a big deal? Is that a big deal?
Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, maybe for some. I would think. I would think it would. I would think Kevin would write.
Speaker B: I get confused because there's. There's two that I associate with moonbirds is Kevin Rhodes the one not associated anymore?
Speaker A: No, that's Ryan Carson.
Speaker B: Ryan Carson. I get them too confused. I'm gonna be honest.
Speaker D: You shouldn't use their names in the same sentence.
Speaker A: Stop it. Ryan Carson left his wonderful, cushy job at Moonbird to be a lowly poap farmer. He's traded in the. The tech life for the farmer life, and he's out there just giving po apps to the people and is a wonderful spaces host in this space part of his career. Yeah. So that's not Kevin Rose. However. Would you like to hear the story? Some may have already told it. I'm.
Speaker B: So this person is directly associated with moonbirds.
Speaker A: It's Kevin Rose. Do you not. Do you actually not know?
Speaker B: I know the other one.
Speaker A: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't tell if you're fucking with me or not because this is more important than story. Are you actually serious or not?
Speaker B: I know that Kevin Rose is associated with moonbirds. Yeah.
Speaker A: Do you know?
Speaker B: I don't know what he looks like.
Speaker A: Who? Kevin Rose or like.
Speaker B: I wouldn't know him to see him. I wouldn't know him to hear him.
Speaker A: Steve.
Speaker B: I know the other one. I know Ryan Carson. I know he's got the haircut and the blazer.
Speaker A: Riggs, save me.
Speaker B: I'm out of moonbirds, man. Come on. Moonbirds is done.
Speaker D: There's no saving this conversation at this point. You may know him as k row, you know, that may ring a bell as it pops up on your timeline once in a while.
Speaker A: Oh, chamber sounds an awful lot like a guy that would wear those sunglasses right now. I'm not gonna. Not gonna lie. He sounds like he's about to go and. And just, like, the full on deal with it, right? Like. But I usually. Usually. I can tell very well if chambers, like, just, like, gaslighting me to make it think, like. Yeah, like, you. You typically. I can tell when you're like, you know, doing a bit. I genuinely cannot tell this time. If you truly don't know who Kevin Rose is outside of Moonbird, we'll never know.
Speaker B: I don't even know. I think I've convinced myself that I don't even know.
Speaker A: So I don't want to tell the story anymore because it's not fun.
Speaker B: The people want to know. Don't let me. Shenanigans. Yeah. Well, before.
Speaker D: Before we get into your story, what I'd like to make sure we have prior to the next trip, you know, next convention out in Vegas is some Djinn versions of those sunglasses. And I want. I want chamber ripping fucking heaters, ripping darts, rocking those glasses, bald, walking through the casino.
Speaker B: I mean.
Speaker A: Yeah, but he would totally fit in with those.
Speaker B: Absolutely.
Speaker A: There's a lot of those walking around the. Especially, you know, some of the maybe lower end casinos. Definitely have a lot of those sunglasses walking around. It's got to be during his chain smoking time, though. Oh, totally way.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: All right, chamber. You might have to just extend it.
Speaker G: Same color scheme. So you just need the deejan logo on the side of it.
Speaker A: It actually is the same color scheme. You can. Maybe we could do something really corny and have them like. Like a shade inside of the actual lens where, like, it when the light hits them a certain way, you could just see the Djen logo. Maybe that'll be it. But circles, let's go to you because I can't. I still can't get over Chamber right now. I don't even know how to do. I don't know how to do.
Speaker G: Sorry, I put my phone down for a half second right after you called me. I'm like, dang it. That was poor life choice. The AI discussion. I think it was homeless over in DJ network. I think it was actually under coffee with Captain comments section had brought me out to cactuse.
Speaker A: You still.
Speaker G: That's one that you can only do a few free trials with and then you have to pay for it. But that is an AI that his kids have been using to write essays with. So chat GBT may be tackled, but there are still others out there that are free. Well, not free, but can be used for these purposes.
Speaker A: This homework thing is like such an interesting thing. Chamber, have you caught your children trying to use AI for home?
Speaker B: No, my oldest is only in the fourth grade. I mean, she uses me for most of her homework. She's not. She's not at that point.
Speaker A: She's in a world of her. You should actually. You should introduce her to chat if she's using you for homework. Hey, listen, sweetie, you could get at least to see if you use. Bring those D's up to. Up to c minus. Chat GPT. Chat GPT. Bring those ds to C's.
Speaker B: I love it.
Speaker A: Chat GPT. Get a passing grade. I wonder if Steve's kids are using chat.
Speaker B: I think he's a little bit older. It wouldn't shock me.
Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's. I mean, like, they're in. They're in like, potentially chat GPT.
Speaker B: I've seen many teachers kind of recommend that they, you know, to other teachers not to give essay home. Essay homework. So any essay work is done in class.
Speaker A: Oh, they got to get x. They got to get creative with their homework assignments.
Speaker B: Essay work needs to be done in class so as not to use AI to generate any, you know, any essays or book reports or.
Speaker A: Oh, wow, it's crazy. That's super interesting, actually. I never even thought of that. Like, AI's putting teachers on blast to get creative with their assignments, and there's.
Speaker B: No, like, there's literally no way of telling.
Speaker F: They're fun.
Speaker A: Like, yeah, I mean, totally. Like, it's. I. What age do you think is most likely to use chat GPT on their homework? College.
Speaker B: Oh, for sure. I would say, like, twelve to 20. Like that. That's when you're using it.
Speaker A: Twelve to 20. I would say, yeah, I would probably high school. Definitely college. I would have used at least the first shit.
Speaker B: At least the first, like two years of college.
Speaker A: Yeah, I would have used the shit out of this in college. Like, it's. Yeah, totally. This would have been a college savior there. We. We do have a new poll up. Is it okay if kids use chat GPT to write their homework?
Speaker B: 100%.
Speaker A: You're saying yes?
Speaker B: Absolutely. Come on. Like, what are we doing? Like, essays?
Speaker A: It's. I mean, I understand. I understand that right now. Like, I sound like the guy that's like, don't use a calculator.
Speaker B: Tell me it's not the right.
Speaker A: Like, I get no.
Speaker B: Oh, is he rugging? Is he rugging? Am I still rugged? Am I still here?
Speaker A: No.
Speaker B: You'Re good, buddy.
Speaker A: The cord came out of my phone while I. Sorry.
Speaker B: It's getting animated.
Speaker A: Yeah, I was. I was getting. You got a corded phone, grandpa? Yeah, sorry. The dial pad did it. It was taking too long to rotate the rotary. I know I sound like the guy that says, don't use a calculator, but, like, this is very. It's different than a calculator. Is it nothing?
Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think when we were kids, our teachers would say, you're not going to be walking around with a calculator in your pocket at all times. And now we do. So, I mean, theoretically, 20 years from now, we could be walking around with AI generating. You know what I mean? And AI generator in our pocket. I mean, which is technically our phone anyways.
Speaker A: Sure.
Speaker B: But who knows what 20 years from now looks like, you know what I mean?
Speaker A: All right, I think that's fair. I think you might have just swayed me, even. Cause even on coffee with captain this morning, I think it was cap, that might have brought up the quote that he saw on either LinkedIn or Twitter or something that said, like, in 20 years, AI is not gonna replace your job, but somebody using AI will replace your job. So I guess might as well lean into it. Let's go to Steve. Steve, are your kids using AI for homework yet?
Speaker C: I don't think my kids know what AI is yet. It's just. It's mostly amongst, uh, I think, older kids and us nerds who are excited about it. But I actually. There's, like, I don't know where. Which school with odd eye. Actually, Lynn thought on to lean into on this one, because this one's, like, a hard. Because on one hand, the points you were made about a calculator is actually really strong, right? I mean, like, I'm a shitty speller and I'm not going with directions and there's gps and there's, you know, spell check. But on the other hand, like, I'm trying to remember who it was. I heard. I heard, like, somebody on a podcast talking about how there's this scary thing. It might've been like, Neil degrasse Tyson or someone about how, like, we're losing the idea of intellectual thought because, like, yes, we have it at our fingertips. But, like, when somebody would say, like, oh, who is that person from that movie? A bunch of people would sit around on a couch until they racked their brain and got the answer. Now everyone just pulls out their phones, and they immediately have the answer. And there's something to be said about, like, are we not, like, working the muscle of our brain enough? But I don't know. Then on the flip side, like, anybody who knows how to use AI properly is actually. It's just like any other tool, like Photoshop or anything else, like, bunch was saying. So this is a really, really complicated one to answer. Cause there's, like, all these layers to it of what you're learning and how you're using it. But, I mean, ultimately, to chambers point, when kids grow up, they're gonna end up using AI for everything they do. So not. So learning how to use it now is like, when people say, get kids off the iPad screen to some degree, because that's the world they're gonna grow up in. So, I don't know, just like, one of those really, really super complicated conversations that's, like, hard to digest as we go through it. It almost makes my head hurt.
Speaker A: So, hypothetical scenario, your kid comes home next week and says, hey, I have this assignment. I'd like to use AI to help me, what are you going to do?
Speaker C: I'm going to ask if the teacher said it was okay. Cause I do want to teach my kids to follow like moral, like the.
Speaker A: No, I think that's a good answer. Hey, I think that's a good answer.
Speaker B: Like, you know, I ask me that same question. Punch.
Speaker C: But chamber. Before you ask Chamber, real quick, I was going to say the other thing is this is probably this. You guys are going to roll your eyes at me. But if my kids that they want to use it, I would probably want to ask what the teacher said. And if they're like, well, the teacher said we can't, or we contact the teacher and emailed her and she's like, no, you can't. I would actually probably say like, well, let's do both. And you can show me how you use AI and try to turn it to like a fun game parent child activity with them. And then we can see which one is better and if they're decipherable. And I'd probably have a little fun with my kids with it. And then they kind of get the best of both worlds where they actually have to think and do it. And then we can do the AI one and we can see what the differences are and if there's things that you can glean and learn from the AI one and go that way.
Speaker A: Oh, I kind of like the idea of doing them like next to each other and comparing. That's a fun wrinkle there. Um, yeah, it's also very Steve, totally Steve to do, uh, that you just created yourself twice the work there. But I, I would actually utilize AI to have the conversation with my children instead because that's, that's much easier, you know? No, I mean, hey, chat GPT and tell me how I should. Tell me if I should let my kids use AI for their homework. You should.
Speaker B: Definitely. Bunch of. It's much easier doing it the hard way.
Speaker A: I saw Riggs hand 1 second. I gotta give my two cent here.
Speaker B: On this AI thing, okay. Because if my kid comes to me and says, hey, can I use AI to do this book report or whatever? And I think our job as parents is to get them prepared for the world. And listening to rules and following rules is not preparing them. You need to show them how to.
Speaker A: What do you mean? You follow rules every day.
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But I'm also looking on ways to subvert the rules. That is stealing from any self checkout that I can find. But working smart and not hard. I have a full time job yet. I do this all the time. I'm breaking the rules every single day of my, like, every single day, I'm breaking rules. I'm finding ways to make my life easier and, and balancing all of the, you know, all of the stuff I need to do in my real world job and finding little ways to sneak in other things that I want to do. So subverting the rules.
Speaker A: But I would argue that those, I would argue that those rules that you're breaking are not really good rules. Then you're not out here. You're not out here robbing banks, are you? Like, that's.
Speaker B: And I would argue that the teacher saying don't use AI is not, is a shitty role, too, that we should go, you know?
Speaker A: Okay, that's fair.
Speaker B: You know what I mean?
Speaker A: Yeah. That's what I'm actually having a lot of fun with this conversation.
Speaker C: You lose, I mean, you lose a little bit of juice when you're like, just like I steal from self checkouts as your example of they want me to use a little bit of juice.
Speaker B: They want me to check myself out. I mean, I deserve a couple of free things here and there. Got those sunglasses.
Speaker A: The sunglasses, you know, how do $3 pairs of sunglasses. Jesus. It's got a whole trunk full of them. All right, let's go to Riggs and then Chris.
Speaker D: I don't even know how to follow all of that other than I feel like if I do wear those sunglasses, I should steal things at self checkout. 100% in agreement there.
Speaker A: I think you, I think you've got your proof points. Yes. There's a reason chamber knows that those sunglasses mean certain things. It's because he wears them while he steals.
Speaker D: Hundred percent. I wasn't sure I was going to do this either, but now that there's been a couple DM's going on, I have to Twitter. Bay, I owe you a massive apology on Bundy and circles.
Speaker B: I wasn't, I wasn't going to bring, I wasn't going to bring it up. I got to do it.
Speaker D: I think I'm going to pull a frank and say I'm going on air to do this apology because I think it's going to be less awkward than doing it behind the scenes. I said, as a female, give me a thumb. Give me a thumbs up or thumbs down. As a female, if we're talking about.
Speaker A: BC use or Jared Leto, there was.
Speaker B: Like ten of us. There was like ten of us on that space. I just. Yeah.
Speaker D: So I'm gonna throw Dow Jones under the bus first because he said, you know, like. Like Twitter Bay down there as a female, so that I carry it on. So Twitter as a male, I apologize. Absolutely.
Speaker C: Wait, riggs, can I. Before you. Before you answer, before you go any further, can I ask you a question? I know we were talking chappie GBT and Riggs, as a female, would you let your kids use chat GBT for their homework?
Speaker A: Beep, boop, beep, boop, beep.
Speaker B: When Bay said something and it wasn't a female's voice, I thought of riggs immediately. I'm like, of course, the DM's.
Speaker A: We chatted as soon as he talked.
Speaker B: It was like, well, I mean, to.
Speaker F: Be fair, like, my name is in my handle. So if you're just looking at Twitter Bay, then clearly you're not using Twitter properly.
Speaker A: Oh, my God. It does. It says Randall.
Speaker B: I know a few.
Speaker A: Yes, it does.
Speaker D: Yes, it does. So I am putting it out there on air in a recording. My apologies. I did not.
Speaker F: And my PFP is a bald guy, so I don't know.
Speaker A: Yeah, not wearing those glasses either, riggs. Oh, my God. That was incredible. I just. I don't even know where to go from here. But we're going to throw down to Chris. We'll go a little long today because we're having a good old time here. But, Chris, down to you.
Speaker H: Oh, thanks, man. I don't know how to follow the Twitter baby, but I apologize on behalf of Riggs. I guess we'll just go there. So, backing up to the AI and the calculator things, I'm a product of the show your math the long way instead of using your calculator because you weren't going to have the power of the world in a little phone in your pocket, which now my kids sit there and ask Alexa questions or to spell something or whatever when they're doing their homework. So it is a tool. They still need to learn how to do it, but I don't think that that's a tool. But they also got to learn why they're using a tool and how to use the tool or how to do the things in order to do them correctly, no matter, like, whether it's a math problem or learning how to write so you don't sound like an idiot or whatever the case may be. So I. There's. There's places for them, but they can't start out with, I'll just use. I'll just tell AI to do it and then I'll just be a, you know, a sports jock, or I'll just wear those fucking sunglasses, or I'll just, you know, steal stuff from the. From the self checkout, whatever the case may be.
Speaker A: I mean, a couple fantastic. First of all, fantastic points, but even better, like, ribbing on chamber, getting those in there very subtly. They're just. Those are the best. And I agree with you in the sense that, like, you can't just pick up these tools either, and just. And it waves a magic wand. Right. Even I've tried to do stuff that I am normally good at, like, just writing a small blog post, and I'm decent at that. But, like, if you just do it without knowing how a blog post should be written and why, it doesn't help you.
Speaker C: Right?
Speaker A: So I think that's a fair point there. Let's go to circles. And then I have to. Vicki. Vicki requested up, so then we have to go to Vicki before we shut it down. So circles, what you got to.
Speaker G: I've got two things. On the Twitter bay thing, I definitely remember mid Rig's conversation on the space. What was that? Yesterday or Friday? Whatever. I'm like, I'm pretty sure Twitter Bay is a guy like him stream of, like, as a female, so that's. That's just always something funny to be in the background with. As for the chat, well, yeah. What are you gonna say?
Speaker F: I was just gonna say, I'm so honored that you guys spend so much time thinking about it.
Speaker B: I'm glad I've.
Speaker A: It's really gotten in their head.
Speaker F: Solved the mystery.
Speaker A: Well, thanks for jumping up and solving the mystery for us.
Speaker G: As for the chat GBT thing, I mean, like, I feel like as long as everybody has equal access to it, which is kind of my concern, is if they try and monetize it, and then it's only, like, people who have the money are able to use it as a resource, and you kind of create this disparity that way, which is no bueno. Um, but as long as everybody has the same resources, like, uh, shoot, who was it? Chris was saying it's a tool. And, like, shoot. Typing out essays, like, yeah, we did it in high school, college, whatever. I haven't had to really type out an essay now. I'm, like, not necessarily in a field that. That matters all that much, but it's just like, if we have the tools to do it, let's learn it a little while, but also, like, maybe let's edit our teaching styles to incorporate those tools, not run away from it and, like, have it be banned or something like that. Like, there's ways to use it thoughtfully.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a fair point. Like, if I would have had it, then I wouldn't have had to hire all those other guys to write essays for me in college, right? I could have just used chat GPT, but I saw corporate trash come up, too. We got to go, Vicky and then CT before we shut this down. Vicki, gM. Oh, wait, I did see Aaron as well, so we'll go. Vicki, Aaron, CT.
Speaker I: I thought I better come up as the female just to balance it out so you guys don't get cancelled. Like, at least you can say there was definitely a woman present kind of thing. I just want to give everyone a heads up as well. Cimpa's Twitter account has been hacked, so feel free to share out the retweeted tweet that I've put from Kenobi just to keep everybody safe. But, yeah, I haven't roasted today, but I have posted a picture in the war room. You can decide whether you think it's chambers or riggs.
Speaker A: Oh, I can't wait to see this. Vicki, if you have that tweet, would you mind, since your speaker, I think you could pin it up there, if you haven't already, for the Twitter hack. That'd be awesome. And then let's go see what you. Oh, my God. I need to copy that chamber. Do you see it in the. In the worm post? That one, please. I actually think this is definitely more. Looks like you.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, we don't wanna. We don't wanna. Yeah. Riggs.
Speaker I: Who wants to write boring essays when you can make yellow?
Speaker A: Wait, you made that? Yeah. So actually, I want to ask you. You. I was hoping you would chat about the AI because. Cause you have been utilizing AI for your art. So, like, I think you're a perfect example of. Right. You know, you don't have. It's a tool, but you have to know how to use it for it to actually be effective. Right. Like, my. I've messed around with the AI art stuff and, like, I don't even know where to start to, like, refine my things like that. And you've put out an entire collection, you know, utilizing it as part of your toolset. So, like, I. Where do you weigh in on AI? And, you know, even if it was, like, your kids using home, doing it for homework, but where do you weigh in on the whole thing?
Speaker I: Well, I've got children that are old enough that I certainly would have used it either myself or got them to use it rather than some of the stupid questions teachers get the kids to do, to waste their time, which ends up wasting the parents time. So I'm all for anything that makes life quicker, because life is for living, not sitting in front of, like, learning about algebra that you're never gonna fucking use in your life. It's just a waste of time. So I'm, I'm all down for quitting college, no debt, kids going out there and doing real work.
Speaker A: So.
Speaker I: Yeah, and real work. Our class is now sitting on AI for hours on end, making all sorts of unusual art and stuff like that. But yeah, it's just this process. People think it's easy. Aihdena and also, the other thing is that I found out recently, which blew my mind, we're talking about AI as like a five year old. But the bottom line is that the military are actually using AI right now in terms of reconnaissance and missiles and potential war threats. And that blew my mind when I found that out. So we're only getting like the toddler version. Some of the other people around us are getting like the kind of evolving version, which is pretty damn scary.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point. I. So everybody, take Vicki's advice. Quit school, make AI art, and watch out for the military grade AI, because it's, it's sentient.
Speaker B: That was great advice. That was very.
Speaker A: I think it is. It is great advice. We. Aaron, we'll go to you and then CT and then we'll shut this thing down. Down.
Speaker E: Hey.
Speaker C: Hey.
Speaker E: Thanks for having me up on stage. This has been a great discussion about the chat and AI and everything. And I think Vicki's right also about that. There's this comparison between what AI is allowing people to do with art and what AI is now allowing people to do in writing essays. I'm a college professor, so of course I get students that come in and hand in essays. And to me, if I think if it's a tool that they can use to help their writing, then I'm all for it. Actually, I don't. I'd rather just read good stuff than to read some of the crap that comes across my desk sometimes. And as I agree with others, if you are trying to make AI art, it's not easy. I think the same is going to apply for, you know, using it to make essays and longer format writing. So I'm all for it. By the way, since I'm on stage, I'm gonna just also say out loud in public, thanks to Steve NFT bark for save my ass this past Saturday.
Speaker A: There will be no, there'll be no, Steve, kudos here. Absolutely not. Not on my stage.
Speaker B: I thought I hit it.
Speaker C: He was about to say something really nice, too. You said, I wonder what Steve did.
Speaker A: I'm just kidding. Eric, go back. Sorry, I just had to do it for the bit. He didn't even. Maybe he didn't hurt his feelings. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just did it.
Speaker E: All right, I'm. You just. You. Damn it. You muted me. Fuck. So I'm in LA. I cannot make it to coffee and captain on a regular basis. I'm sorry, I just. 05:00 a.m. no, I'm sorry. I value my sleep. So I had to bring the kudos to him, to Steve on your show. I'm sorry to crash them in condition with some coffee with captain. Kudos. But, hey, somebody's got to do it now and then.
Speaker A: That's right. Usually I'm muting chamber or people saying nice things about chamber, but Steve, Steve was the typical place. I'm sorry for making you part of the bit, Aaron. My apologies.
Speaker E: No worries. And if I get one request, we got to build a chat, an AI chat that makes roasts easier so we can all jump in on roasting everybody here, especially chamber.
Speaker A: The one time I actually tried to do this for the show, and I tried to do it with chat GPT, and it went on this, like, it basically called me a terrible person and said it would never, under any circumstances, participate in a roast. And I was like, oh, man, I'm a shithead for even thinking about wanting to roast somebody. And it really. And I never told a joke again. That was it. CT, let's go to you, and then we will shut it down.
Speaker B: First of all, you guys make me laugh, for real. Like, you guys are funny. I wish you guys all lived in LA so we could go to happy hour or something. I don't guess Aaron does, but, like, yeah, I also can't tune in to coffee with captain because I'm, like, half asleep. But as far as AI goes, to be honest, I'm just thankful that you guys haven't pivoted to being those, like, chat DPT thread guys that are like, I think everyone's doing it wrong, or, like, everyone's job is doomed and that you still love jpegs because there's been so many people who have just, like, left jpegs for AI and, like, we're too much of degenerates to do that. So that's all I really wanted to say.
Speaker A: So we're here. We're here for the jpEg. We're ride or die jpegs here. We'll throw in the AI stuff as, as part of it. But I, it's funny, I think you've seen, I agree with you. I've seen a lot of, like, chasing the hot new thing as far as people trying to make threads and engagement farming, if you will. So I'm totally with you on that. I did want to ask Vicki one question, though, before we go down, because we've, we've said a couple times that, like, it's a tool, it's, and it's, it's hard to use. It's not easy if you don't know what you're doing. Vicki, like, what was your process to learn how to do it? Is there some resources you could guide people to if they wanted to learn how to do it? Or are you all just like trial and error?
Speaker I: It started out trial and error, but I found a heck of a lot of, like, videos on YouTube, some people that I gelled with, some people that I didn't. I'm also in Facebook groups as well. I help more than one of the very large Facebook groups that's got 20,000 users in, so. And that's alongside running a business. So I tell you kind of how committed I am. I would say my average learning is three to 4 hours a day over the course of every day for the last six, seven months of learning. Trial and error, minus weights, kind of. You can also look in mid journey at the community pictures and see what prompts they're using to get an idea as a start out. But then really, it's just a case of jumping in and finding your style. And I wouldn't even say I've necessarily found like, inverted commas my style, but it's a starting basis for, obviously, the early days. I wanted to get something out while it's still quite rough and ready. AI hasn't worked out fingers and hands and stuff like that. And I fully believe people should still put out those kind of images because they're going to be a big part of history, like the renaissance that's coming through of like, you can laugh about the early images. You'll literally be able to look at an image and go, oh, that was circa 20, 22, 23, because you can see the hands. But yeah, anyone that's not sure about it, I always say before you make a decision, go try it. That's the biggest thing you can do. It's just, it's such a great tool and it's such, such fun as well, and obviously your kids are going to be using it.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's interesting. Three or 4 hours a day is wild commitment. So kudos to you. And, like, I've tried to do the trial and everything and, you know, it gets better with every try, but it's still not. It's not easy. Riggs, we were joking about the. The hands in the war room the other day and what the. The prompts would have to be like to not to. We were like, we literally sent one. It was like, hey, just make a pair of hands. Normal human hands, nothing weird about them. Don't fuck up the hands and see what it gave us. And they were still just all, I know. And one of them was like a pile of hands. Like, literally, like hands on top of hands. So then we took that same prompt and just put, certainly not a pile of hands and see if it changed anything. And it was really fun to mess around with, with the hand stuff, but. All right, we've got. I think I saw Bundy's hand come up. We got Bundy. We got Twitter bay, and we'll. We'll shut it down with her. Oh, Jesus. How do. How do you go after that? Uh, no, this is for all the. The west coasters. I think, uh, Steve and Cap need to do maybe once a week. Spatchcocked with Steve. Oh, my God. Yes. Spatchcock with some coffee with captain and spatchcocked with Steve. That's an after.
Speaker C: That sounds like an after dark show.
Speaker A: Actually does. That's degen. After darken. Uh, maybe. Maybe Tuesdays and Thursdays. Batchcock with Steve. I dig it. Uh, Twitter bay, let's go to you, and then we'll shut it down.
Speaker F: All right, so I did put in the prompt with chat GPT to write a short and quick, hilarious introduction to this Twitter space. Would you like me to read it?
Speaker A: Oh, 100%. It's the perfect way to close this out now.
Speaker F: And please don't mute me when you hear your name.
Speaker A: I won't.
Speaker F: Alright, so welcome to the mint condition, where we bring you the most unique and bizarre collectibles from around the world. I'm your host, bun chu, and joining me every week is my co host, the bald and bearded wonder chambers. He's not just a pretty face, though. He's also the self proclaimed redneck glasses bandit known for his daring heist at the self checkout.
Speaker A: Yo, this is amazing.
Speaker F: Together, we'll dive into the weird and wacky world of collecting and meet some the most interesting people in the industry. So grab your redneck glasses and join us on them in condition.
Speaker A: That was just the perfect way to close this out. It was. This has probably been one of my favorite episodes. Chamber, where does it. I asked you to rank our episode last week. Give this one a rating from one to ten.
Speaker B: It's definitely a 9.5 for me. These spaces, having you guys come up and talk and share your input, it adds such another layer to the show. I mean, we've always had fun doing our show, but having that additional layer of people come up and talk and immediately get feedback on my terrible takes. For years, I thought my takes were great. Bunch would agree with me occasionally.
Speaker A: And.
Speaker B: Now it turns out they're all terrible. So I really appreciate guys coming here every other day and making me laugh and it's. They're awesome. So they're. In my opinion, these spaces are just going to continue to be like nine, nines and ten shows.
Speaker A: Basically, that's a high bar to live up to. But we will try. Some days when I don't feel like a nine or ten, the people bring us there, so I appreciate that too. So that's going to do it for us. Today we missed Destin, but we will be back with Des and chamber and redneck glasses on more intense capers next time. Wednesday, four to 05:00 p.m. we'll have a link out shortly for that, but until next time, stay mint.
Speaker E: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did chamber not know he was the heel then what?
Speaker A: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. We came back for something. I forgot to do the prop. Bets. I forgot to do the prop. Ed, are you. Let's see. I can go through them really quickly. I gotta find.
Speaker E: We couldn't leave.
Speaker A: Where? Hold on. Where is it?
Speaker B: Let's see.
Speaker A: You're never gonna find it.
Speaker B: Just dust off my computer here. Get on discord.
Speaker A: This is the. This is like the lost tapes. I don't even know where they went. Geez, this shows a. Definitely a ten, by the way. Now after that, just so, just so.
Speaker B: You know, there was another .5 we needed, right?
Speaker A: I don't know where Des put them. I don't.
Speaker B: TMC live?
Speaker A: No, they're definitely not there. Um, hold on. Let me see a list of threads here. Uh, this just went to a ten and a half for failing so miserably. I don't think maybe he didn't put any. Well, so much for that. End the show. Bye.
