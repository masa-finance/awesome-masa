It's like when, like, when these events, like, it really is a testament to how small the space is because when we have these events on, the engagement across Twitter is so much less. I think there's, like, 20,000 people in this space. I think Max. And so it's interesting to see that.

So I haven't been up to date with the specifics of what's been going on. But of course, one thing is, when it comes to these events, there's two things that usually happen. People end up getting sim swapped and hacked. So, like, we saw, like, the vfriends situation, like the VCOn where people got hacked and. And they didn't realize until it was too late. So just make sure you're aware of, like, when it comes to announcements, like many, we get many false announcements or scam announcements across these events from people of particular interest. So be aware of those. So any stealth drops and shit like that, probably try not to, you know, get too excited about them because they may be scams. And the other thing is, is just to watch out for, like, QR codes, you know, out on the street that, you know, we had this thing last year, people were like, just, you know, sticking these QR codes on like lamps and stuff like that and getting their wallet straight."

I didn't even smoke my vape once all episode. I don't know if it helped or not. I don't think it helped. But yes, we will have party icons. I would say that a good chunk of the show, I don't know if it's gonna be the whole show, but I say a good chunk of the show. We will be talking NFts and the future of NFt gaming. I'm gonna be honest, I haven't read much of what I'm supposed to be reading up on, so I know they're called party icons. I believe it's NFT gaming, but that's all I know right now. We're going to learn together on Friday."

I'm going to be honest, just reading the notes was like, like eight and a half difficulty for me, especially with all of you guys listening. So yes, tune in on Friday. We're going to learn about some nfts. I think we're giving away whitelist spots on that one as well. Again, the real host knows what's happening, but I'm pretty sure that is the case. And before I forget, make sure you're liking and subscribing to our newsletter. Do we pin the newsletter up there, by the way?"

There's a recap of, you know, all of the articles that we put out during the week, the shows that we do. That's for the Tuesday newsletter. We do one on Friday as well, that one of our writers takes a deep dive in a kind of the biggest news of the week. So pain, what was last week? I forget what we did last week.
