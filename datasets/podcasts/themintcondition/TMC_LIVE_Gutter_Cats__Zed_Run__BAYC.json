They're echoing our feedback, I think, and they're trying to take some of our feedback into account here. When it comes to what they're doing for the drop, so are we.

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. No. And so timing wise, the rollout, I think, is, you know, very similar to what I would have thought the drop would be. I'm surprised that they went again with the waves. So one level of detail there is that there are going to be four waves, and I think they're spaced out 15 minutes apart. So the whole drop is going to be like an hour and hour. Like, that's it."

        "text": "Which is just so crazy. So drop one will, or whatever you want to call it, wave one will commence at 05:00 p.m. pacific tomorrow. And then every 15 minutes, there's going to be a second wave and third wave and a fourth wave. And so your stable will get assigned to one of those drops. And a very critical piece of information, your stable will only be able to purchase a horse in that drop that you're assigned. So last time there were people sharing links and you could purchase on wave three and wave two, even if you weren't assigned to it this time. That is not the case. You are going to be assigned a wave, actually, two through four. Cause another piece of it is. Wave one is exclusive to those people who missed out on their drop last time. They. They sent a. Yeah, they sent a link for, like, the 615 drop last time, and it was dead. No one could use it for that drop, or majority people couldn't use it for that drop. So they're kind of making, you know, I don't know, a reward or, you know, making an apology for those people."

So they couldn't get it on that one, and they get a link to an exclusive wave just to the people who missed out on the last drop on that 615 dead link is going to be wave one. So actually, every. Let me rephrase that. All stables will be assigned either wave two, three, and four. So really only three waves for the general public. So hopefully there'll be a lot of horses within those waves. But, you know."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, so now, as Des said, 415 minutes drops. The first one is gonna be only for those who missed their dead link last time. You're going to be able to purchase one horse per stable, and then there's a ten minute cool down period. So after that ten minute cooldown, if there's still horses available, you can purchase another one. But just."

    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I just got to interject, just so it's very clear, because I don't want anyone getting mad at us, you're not guaranteed a horse, so you still better click as fast as humanly possible when you get that first ten minute cooldown."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And this is. I think this is a huge piece because what you said is super important. Just the ten minute cooldown assumes there's supply. Right? Like, I think in this case, the ten minute cooldown is going to kind of be for show, right? Like, if I don't expect there to be horses after ten minutes, right? Because not only there's half the amount of waves this time, right? So, like, there is, you know, twice as many people in each wave going for the same amount of horses. I guess there'd be twice as many horses in each wave. But, you know, I don't anticipate there being a lot of time for a second horse."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "What I could see, and just based off of the demand last time, if you really, really want, you know, multiple horses and. And you're willing to pay up for a z two or z three or z four, maybe buy that one after your 1010 2nd cooldown timer. Just saying those are the ones that went last, you know, last time that were still available. The z two s were available for a while. The z four three s were available for a little while. So if you. If you want that one, maybe you get that after the cooldown timer. But yeah, like Bunchy said, this is just a way to guarantee people get a maximum of one horses. I have zero inclination that I'll get any more than just one horse. And even then it's, you know, it's going to be up to chance."

You're depositing your eth to we on Matic. That's what you're paying with. The prices will be the same in USD. That's. It's a considerably more amount. Considerable more amount of we this time. So, you know, like it or hate it, I think that shows where we're talking about from. What do you think that means for secondary market prices on what's already out there? Because this was big speculation on, like, which way it was going to go. Is it going to be pegged because Eth is down. So is it pegged to wheat or peg to USD?"

But what I will say is they changed the narrative here a little bit because people were upset with the huge price increases last time and they were like, oh, you know, we were kind of tracking more towards the price action of wheat at the time. Well, now they reverted back to USD, so, you know, the narrative is switched a little bit. I don't think it's, in the end, horrible. Right. What would have been really interesting is if they decided to do cheaper prices, which I agree is not probably good for the market. Economics anyways."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place there. Right. Like agreed. Do they lower the USD price which could affect the secondary market and what's going on with hopefully upcoming breeding, all of that kind of stuff. So I don't know what the right play is. It's just going to cost you more eth so if you're, I mean, play that strategically, as you will. Right. So, um, lastly here, though, I think, and, and I need some clarification on this because I was kind of confused when I was reading this. Your stable has to be created by today or was it by yesterday?"

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "You also have to be really fast. Like you, there's a good chance you're getting email in the same wave if you have a multiple stables at this point because they, they lowered the number of waves. So like you would have to be very quick. Even if you do have multiples, you, you will laughing at that comment. You the, you will have to, I mean, that's going to happen. People have multiple stables. People have a breeding stable. They have a racing stable. And that's not even I don't think is considered frowned upon by Zed. Like lots of people have it. So there are chances that multiple people, that people are going to get multiple horses. I don't think it's as going to be as nefarious as last time as far as, you know, link sharing and people getting 20 horses and all of that kind of stuff. But yeah, so that's the thing. If you, so if you haven't made a stable yet, sounds like you might be sol, but there we, there we are."

All right, I had some prices listed because I'll be honest with everyone on my strategy is we see a price action drop, post drop. Right? So the horses drop, people want to flip them, they'll take whatever they can get. It instantly drops below the average for the past week. That's just how it works. So I think that's actually a great buying opportunity because what we've seen is over the course. And as unraced, unbred horses get raced, the supply dwindles and the demand goes up and, you know, the price keeps going higher until the next drop. Well, two things. We only have a few more drops left, if that. So if you wanted to buy your unraced, unbred for decent prices, prices, or best probably time to do it, is post drop tomorrow, like within 24 hours, because that's when prices will be cheapest. And then we'll just slowly continue to climb until the next drop, and then it'll drop off and, and continue to build. So, you know, I think it'll be interesting. Now what we'll, I don't want to get into too much economic theory, but because the dispersion of these horses should be better this time. Right. The distribution of the horses per stable should be better. Right. I wonder if people will be as willing to sell. It's very easy to sell a horse if you got six in the drop, harder to sell if you just got one. So I don't know."

Let's call it, .35 for argument's sake. I think that because there's still that huge gap between 0.03 whatever and point, you know, 35, I think you're going to see a price dip.

And then what will happen is, you know, that original secondary market will come out. Maybe it starts at, .3 and then it's going to be undercut, undercut, undercut. So I can get more of my horse, and then it bounces back up and then slowly rises till the next drop. Or, you know, last time, maybe. Or maybe after the last drop, that goes away forever. But I think that's what you'll see. It's like undercutter, undercutter, undercutter. Supply dries up and then back up right where. And it's just like Des was saying, if there's more dispersion this time, you're going to see, you may not see as drastic of a dip. You probably still see some, but it's not going to be as drastic because there won't be as many people who got ten plus horses that are willing to cut for, you know, that's a good two x profit. As opposed to ten x profit. Right. So, like. And then you're going to have some of those people are buying because it's their first horse and they're not going to sell at all. Right. So it tomorrow's will be interesting, but definitely that's what we've seen in the past. So let's, let's hit a couple of these comments here. Let's go with Byron.

If you are looking for unraised, unbred genesis horses, yeah, I would say the perfect time is like three to 24 hours. Post drop is your best time to snipe it tomorrow. But if you're just looking for a brand new horse, trying to get entry into this, please, just please, please have the patience to wait a week because you're going to save yourself a lot of wheat buying up cheaper bred horses next week."

Make sure it's, like, ready to go, ready connected, so that you don't have to type in your password and your metamask as you're trying to check out. Just a simple one. Next thing. Now we're actually getting into really valuable tips. I will just speak from the last drop experience, but the key to finding horses quick and getting them to load, because what happens is you go into the site, that's your wave, it loads, and you see gray horses, gray horses after gray horses, just populating, kind of waiting horses."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And just because they're gray for you does not mean they're gray for everybody else. So they're being bought. They're being bought while they're loading into your screen."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Exactly. So what you need to do, based on what I'm gonna do myself last time, it was incredibly valuable. If you did the filters. There's like a filters, and what it allows you to choose is, like jet, or it allows you to choose bloodline. Bloodline, color, colors, gender, things like that. The best way to get a horse last time was to filter for a single color. I was just picking at random. I just picked, you know, whatever color it was. I clicked one color. And basically the methodology there is, it's trying to load so many horses onto your page. All of the horses, right? So if you narrow it down to looking for just a smaller subset of horses, say, by a coat color, then it's going to load faster. And I found that to be true last time."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So that strategy is valuable, especially if you're a. I think it works for low end. If you're looking for a z ten, the only way it won't work is if there are some reason no z ten s in that color that you filter for. Right. Because the other thing too is, is when you do that and your results come up, it's auto sorts by the cheapest, the lowest cost. So as soon as you click a color and it loads, you're going to be seeing tens of yden or nines if there is no ten of that color, or eight if there is no nine, eight or nine or nine or ten of that color. So just keep that in mind. If you, and if you really have a z number in mind, just keep in mind if you do the color thing, that's how it's going to auto sort. So, you know, if you are really picky about what z number you're looking for, maybe filter by that, but you're still going to take, you know, more time than, because you're going to be loading more horses. But who knows? That might not be the case this time. Maybe it'll be fixed. But that's what worked last time. Anything else there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, because they're continuing the same drop mechanics of the waves. So I have high confidence that that would still work. I don't think they randomly just fixed their loading problem. It's not their problem. It's just the fact of trying to load that many token ids into, you know, a live website. It just, it takes time. So if you, if you want to do that, I would. I would do both. Like Nyjetlife just said, I would actually do both. Because think about it, as we said earlier, they're going to be more horses per wave, right? Say there were 700 per wave. Well, now they're 2200 per wave. So it's going to even be harder to load. So I would, you know, if you have a z eight in mind, then freaking click z eight and color and go for it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Another good point, too, which may help people. I don't know if you mentioned it earlier, is know what the, what the coats are like if you, if maybe if you want a rare coat or a super rare, like, know what they are. So if you are going to be specific, you may as well be specific with a rare coat and try and."

So I put out a tweet today and it was like in one of my, it was like in a thread and literally nobody saw the second tweet. So I'm going to probably put it back out by itself. But the biggest thing I said was have a plan. Right? Like have a plan. Decide right now what you want, what your budget allows, and then knowing that filter trick, execute that plan based on that. Right. That's what I would. That's what I would recommend. Cool. So let's move on. We just talked a ton about the Zedrop. It deserves it."

I'm like, this is, it's textbook. It doesn't shock me that today we see a little bit of a dip because it was peaking over the last few days.

It was supposed to launch the week before last week, and it was supposed to launch last week. And the way they were going to do it was essentially release all of them on Opensea and not have kind of, like, the generative, random minting. Right. And then the community said, if this is how it's going to be, probably going to pass, and they decided they were going to make the change. They were going to, you know, listen to the community, go back and kind of do it how, you know, people obviously, like, in the space, like they did with the bored apes and all these other things. And then what happened was, I think, in a week, they couldn't get their contract tight and. Right. And people started minting it an hour before the drop was supposed to happen. And then there was, you know, things where multiple owners were showing and all kinds of crazy stuff, and then, you know, lots of fun came out. And then now almost like a phoenix from the ashes.

And I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but, you know, people are upset about that a little bit. But, you know, anyways, it's a different product. People say the art similar. I think it's kind of different. But anyways, I had a lot of high expectations for it. I saw that they were doing it right. They had a website, it was built well, it looked nice, looked clean. I was ready for the drop last week and then, you know, they said they were going to just do it, what I now call a camel drop, which is just release them all in Opensea."

We'll take the time, we'll get the contract right. We'll do it a week from now, which I thought was ambitious because it's hard to sure up a smart contract like that in a week. But, you know, I gave them benefit of the doubt. I thought that was awesome, that they took the time to do do it. And they were all set to go to launch at 04:20 p.m. eastern yesterday. They had announced it everywhere. And about 40 minutes before, about an hour before, they realized that someone had interacted with their contract earlier than the countdown timer and had minted a couple of the cats, the gutter cats. So in that moment of, oh, panic, they have to make a decision on what to do, right? And so their options are either to just go as planned. Hopefully that source won't mint a ton more cats or release them. All right, now open up the website and release it all. They chose the latter, tried to communicate it as best they could, but for a lot of people that were waiting for that 420 launch, you know, they got shut out because they had launched it 40 minutes prior."

Okay, so then gutter cats came out and, you know, one of the things that we saw yesterday with gutter cats and I think this is an interesting topic is some of the very big names in the NFT space were pretty heavily fudding the project right after all this happened and, you know, talking about like pranksy and Lupify and all those guys, right, the NFT ogs, if you will. And I think this is interesting because you kind of have two sides of it. One, I don't think they're totally wrong, right? Like there was obviously issues with this drop. But two, you know, in fairness, it also appears that sometimes these guys can't get in on a drop where they own the majority share of these releases and all of a sudden it's not a good project. So I think that is a debate that happens. I mean, Franks, he had 900 or 1200 board apes, right? Like so, you know, do you have that many? Yeah, so of course it's a great project, right? Like, so it's, it's a chicken and the egg scenario, right? Like does he have 1200 because it's a great project or is it a great project because it's. He's got 1200? You know, both the duality of man, obviously huge influence. So, you know, take that as you will. But I think, you know, take all that stuff with a grain of salt. When you see some of these influencers out there talking about, you know, whether it's a good project or a bad project. I think we should probably do a show on what makes a good project or what is, you know, a good way to do research on these. But anyway, des, do you have an opinion on that? I'd be interested."

I still think I'm upset about how it was gone about, but they had good intentions, right? If they had bad intentions they would have just released it last week, the camel drop style. So I was trying to think of myself like, I can't cast stones unless I have a better response to what you would do in that moment if you dropped an NFT project. People had been minting early, like what would I have done? And I really was, you know, came to the conclusion which, you know, I don't know what I would have done. I might have just waited it out and seen how much that, you know, nefarious person was minting or just, I don't know, monitored it. But you know, it's, it's one of those things where this is a learning process for everyone. A lot of people are trying to get into this space, myself included. And so this is just another thing that, you know, you have to learn from. Take away and do better next time.

So quite a decent come up. There's also only 3000 of them. This is the smallest minted big NFT project we've seen go out like this. Right? Bonsais was 888 or 8888. Board apes was 10,000. This was 3000. It was incredibly small for the demand so there's that to take into account as well."

And I think this is a really good point because, and I think there's twofold here, right. When you're, a lot of these projects are anonymous founders or developers, right. And a lot of them are just dudes trying to, you know what I mean? Which I don't think is a bad thing, but you just have to make sure that you're doing due diligence on what it is you're actually buying. It's a little more like in crypto. There's a lot of, there's a lot of scams, but it's like you can tell if a project is legit. You could tell if the contract is legit, all that stuff. Right. I think it's a little more difficult in the NFT space just because I think it's a lot, you're dealing with a lot less technical people sometimes as well. So I think that's interesting. You should definitely. What are your thoughts on that, des? I mean, let's, can we, can we talk about it a little here?

You know, go through the actual contract development portion and make sure it works just how like it should work and make sure it's a verified contract, make sure it's kept anonymous, all that stuff. And it's hard, I'll be honest, it's so much harder than I initially planned. And so, you know, I respect anyone who tries to go and do it, but I was kind of getting disappointed just from how long it was taking and all these other projects coming to market sooner.

I don't want to shit on anybody's plan, but there's wonderful things happening with, you know, Bordeaux yacht club. It's definitely the coolest project, has the best community. I am not denying any of those things, but at the same time, it's just my plays is always going to be my priority, is always the next thing. So when we were talking about the bonsai trees, like, a couple of minutes ago, and Des mentioned you didn't miss anything, or maybe you'll miss something a month from now, but in the short term, that first night, maybe that second day, it was hot. Like, it was a hot. It was a hot topic. And I sold a bunch of them. I bought ten, sold a bunch of them. And maybe I'll keep one, maybe I'll keep two. But my play is to buy or try to get in on something as quickly as possible and sell with, you know, into the hype. And if people like the project and that's something they want to hold long term, that's who I'm going to be selling to. Let's realistically, what is. I don't."

Like, I think personally, you know, 90% of these NFT projects that are releasing right now probably won't be worth a their weight in a year or two, but I think there's some super heavy exceptions to that rule.

So, you know, but I think, you know, those kind of projects have super long term viability and they're all kind of fit in this. They're all kind of different categories on why I think that. Right, so, but, you know, I don't see anything wrong with flipping. That's why I typically buy more than one. Right? Like, so I don't feel bad.
