I think there's ten characters and then there's variances on all the characters, like, as far as, like, different traits and stuff like that. So they did like a. Like a semi reveal earlier this week where they just told you out of the ten characters, which one you got. So there is rarity within the ten characters. So I actually ended up getting a couple of pretty rare characters. And then within that, you'll be able to manually reveal the next level where you actually get the traits and stuff.

I started looking a little bit more, you know, I'll put out my. In the war room. Hey, has anybody seen these? And, like, jP's all over me saying, yeah, he's already flipped them once or twice already. So I ended up picking up, like, five of them, knowing that there was going to be a reveal coming. So I kind of was just waiting and seeing what the reveal was going to be. And then I realized, oh, it's almost like a half reveal. And I'm like, okay, well, at least let's see what.

Let me dig in a little bit more. But, yeah, no, the whole reason is just to flip them. So I'll wait till I think they said, January 3 is the day you'll be able to manually fully reveal your cartridge.

So I'm just going through mine. I bought, let's see, I got some of the, first of all, shout outs to our good friend mizzle from the war room. I bought a AI best friend dog yesterday whose name is Katie. I got that. I got some crypto painter, drunk Santas. I have three of those. Don't know what I'm supposed to be doing with them, but I think there was a snapshot. I bought some of these, like, I don't even know how to say the artist's name. It's these, like, glitch ones that are the last editions, like the trust and fucked or whatever the ones they are. I bought seeds. I bought piece of AI art from Vicki.

And then, you know, they actually did, um, you know, have some clout within the community. It wasn't just, like, some random guy saying, hey, this is an offshoot.

I can't remember who else has been saying it, but, like, you know, he, he said literally from the jump, like it was kind of a weird slash shitty move to like, announce that they're moving three months before they actually kind of plan to move with what's going on with Solana.

So that was just the vodka club soda, and when I was trying to do no carbs, that was so vodka Joe came to life, and I've got a comic book series coming out shortly, and the. And then I was always, obviously always a big craft beer guy, and I worked for Sam Adams for many, many years, so I was very partial to all the Sam Adams beers. I couldn't tell. Chamo. You're not a huge driver. I am not. You're not huge. You're not a huge alcohol guy. You're much more of a weed guy. But I do think that if I had to. So I don't know if I could peg you like, a certain, like, an actual recipe.
