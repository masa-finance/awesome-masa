I think Riggs is going to co host with them tonight because I can't make it because it is the day of my wife's birth, so I like to stay married. So I'm going to do that instead of talk football with J web. Uh, then after that, 11:00 p.m. eastern. We have night shift on our YouTube and Twitter as well.

Sorry for that super tangent, but this has been a little bit of a journey for me with this rebrand, both physical and metaphorical, because I was actually on a two week car trip with my family. I've got almost five year old, almost one year old, and my wife driving through national parks. And it was a great trip, but my routine was all thrown off, so I couldn't always be listening. But I was watching. I was watching the episode titles come up as you were putting out the new episodes, and they were like, we're calling it quits. I can't remember what it was, but it was like, what's going on? What is going on with these guys? So, I finally, on the second to last day of the leg from. I think we were at Zion, and we drove to Vegas, and I don't know if you guys have. Have done the sort of modern day car trips with the kids, where a lot of times, you know, there's discussions about what we're listening to, and, you know, sometimes you can just get the. Sometimes my five year old could just get the headphones on him and the iPad in front of him and get the earbuds in. I can just start cranking through these podcasts at 1.4 x. And it was great because I got to catch up on everything, but I had this experience of being like, no, guys, come on. Don't do that web three is the hook that got me to come find DJN and find you guys. And so how would other people find it? The beauty of the big reran. So far, though, I think the irony is you've probably talked more about web three topics with the news segments than you have in the last four or five months."

I think you're, you're totally spot on, though, of like, it's not, and we never wanted to get away totally from, like, web three and AI stuff that we're interested in. I think there's like, when the show is supposed to be all about that and commenting on that, and it's like, does it match what we're, what we actually do? And I think the answer was no, because we're some, we're, we're mostly somewhere in between. We're like, you know, we're, I would say we're hobbyists, or we speak like hobbyists, not experts. And, and, you know, going through news headlines and commenting in the way that we do is much different than, I think, like, what is deserving of a full on web three branded show.

And they're not only into web three stuff, they're into, you know, they're there like, a lot of us are having families or getting married or whatever, and they're going through a bunch of different things.

I mentioned asynchronous, and it's kind of why I'm pretty bad at Discord, too. I feel like this compulsion to always be caught up, and there's like, forget about trying to always be caught up on discord. And it's kind of the same way with, with any of this, you know, synchronous media. So be curious, those differences."

        "speaker": "A",

I think, actually, part of the whole thing that we do here on this show, though, lends itself much more to podcasts and listening later and being asynchronous, rather than, you know, you have to be here during the conversation where. Cause I think there's plenty of shows that are awesome in that format. But I think you're right. Like, we even just at DJ and we talk about this all the time, is like, how many of our shows are podcast worthy versus not where you're talking news of the day, topic of the day all the time. And if you are not there at the time of that conversation is, there's a good chance it passes you by. Right? So, like, you know, even with Djem bets, which we're doing for football, we're, you know, our Monday and Thursday show are kind of evergreen enough that you could catch up throughout the week. So we want to put those out of podcasts. The Sunday show, you have like 3 hours of window where the content is relevant. So we're not putting that out as a podcast. But I think this show totally lends itself to podcast forum because, like, that's where we started. Rect was just a podcast. No video, no spaces. Then TMC was video and podcast, and then, then we turned everything over to spaces. And I think that's part of, like, where that pressure came from, I think chamber, would you agree?"

It just gives us another layer of the show where, you know, we can have people like you, Ryland, come up and, and participate. There's like a participatory factor now that a lot of podcasts don't have. Like, I listen to, you know, six or seven podcasts a day, and none of them have, you know, guests. You know, they could be, you know, usual guests. And again, it always stems back to for me, at least, like the Howard Stern Show, I always loved especially that. I don't know, like the 2010s Howard Stern show with all of the, like, ancillary characters that were a part of it. I love that having. Having usual suspects come up all the time and people phoning in and the spaces allows that to happen. Right? Mister House on we can have, you know, you can have Ryland on, we can have Anthony on.

And then he's going to see if. I mean, talk about timing. If this movie does well, which I think it's projecting that it will, you know, there's an opportunity here for something. So he's got another screenplay, which is cool. The other thing is, I didn't realize he had never written an actual screenplay before, so I don't think I actually realized that. I didn't realize the movies that were made from his books were. He didn't write the screenplays. He just wrote the books that were adapted. So this is pretty cool that, like, you know, goats is in the first ever screenplay he wrote. And, you know, we. I drew and I were joking that we wanted to print out the manuscript and have them sign it for us, but we didn't think about it in time to do that, and Drew doesn't have enough inks to print out 116."

He was at Jacksonville State for a while and did some really good things with that team, and he got a big time college coaching job at Colorado University. And the impressive slash, I guess, maybe controversial to something that he has done, is, like, with the new transfer portal rules, you can basically kind of build a team like an NFL team would. Right? You can offer nil money and all this stuff. So he basically gave the team a facelift. There were 80 new players on the roster, and it's worth noting, Colorado was the worst team in college football last year. They went zero, 112. They did not win a game. And so there's been a lot of hype coming into the season about what he was doing. His kid is the quarterback. His other son plays cornerback on the team. They've got some really decent talent, right? And so kind of this underdog story led by Deion Sanders. And then they open the season playing TCU at TCU, which TCU played for the national championship last year, and TCU."

And then there was some controversy around Dion himself. I guess the coach of Colorado state was not pleased that Deon did not remove his hat and sunglasses when he speak. It, when he was speaking to him and basically called him out. What did Deon things? Deon did Deon things and bought his whole team sunglasses and, you know, just. Just really played it up. And then they went out and almost lost to Colorado State. It took them double overtime to win the game, but they won. So they are now 30, and that's all the d. Sorry."

Poor guy. Like, first of all, if those of you do not know, I have a giant man crush on Saquon Barkley. And he's had, you know, some injury problems throughout his NFL career. And the Giants franchise tagged him last year, so they didn't give him the contract. So he was playing this year to try to get his big contract. Then he gets hurt. So he'll probably be out a couple of weeks. I don't know if it, what the official report was, but that was three weeks is the official report just came out by Adam Scheffer. Okay, that's not bad. I'll take that. But still stinks to see him get hurt. But anyway, that's enough football talk for the day chamber. Did you see this story I posted over the weekend about the bees?"

And then I think the only other time I was camping and I was setting up a tent and I had stepped on, like, a ground nest of wasps, and I felt a little tickle on my foot, which was like, just in flip flops. And I looked down and there was four hornets on my foot and they all stung me simultaneously. That was terrible. But that, I think that's it. Like, that's it."

Yeah, no, hundreds of bees. And we had to call an exterminator and he came and he, you know, got. He killed the nest and all this stuff. And so we've been working through that. And then this weekend, my wife is trying to, you know, make some last minute tidying things for her family coming over, and she was outside straightening up the deck. I have the two boys in the basement, and I'm, like, watching the television. I got a lot going on. There's college football blasting on one tv. I've got two under three year old kids running around and crawling around my basement yelling, screaming, whatever. He's got the iPad going with a movie on, so there's a lot of sounds happening. And I'm standing there and I hear what, what sounded like a scream. And I was like, wow, that's so weird. And I look around, I'm like, I don't know what that was. I thought it might be my son's movie, whatever he was watching. And so I just go back doing my thing, and I hear it again, and I'm like, okay, that's definitely something. So as I. As I'm pulling out my phone to, like, text my wife if she heard anything, I hear it get more frequent and louder. And I'm telling you, it sounded like somebody was being murdered. And I'm like, what the hell is going on? And before I could get upstairs, she opens the door and screams at the top of her lungs, help. I'm being attacked. And I'm like, what is happening right now? I have no idea what the hell is happening. So I, like, leave the kids downstairs. I'm running up, and I go out into, like, I come up from the basement, and she's standing there, like, crying, and she has her shirt off, and I'm like, what the fuck is happening? And she's like, bees. And I was like, oh, my God. I was like, oh, my God. So I look outside, and she was out on the deck, and she was going to put the grill cover back on the grill.
