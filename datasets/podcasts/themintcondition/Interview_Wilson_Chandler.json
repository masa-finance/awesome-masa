And I had that Covid beard that was getting a little, maybe not job friendly. So I, after months and months of growing this thing, I'm like, I gotta shave it down. I shaved down about ten pounds of beer but found about 15 pounds of face behind it. So did not like that very much."

But first and foremost, let's talk about your journey into kind of the crypto space. NfTs, how did you, you know, how did you go from being, you know, basketball NBA player to NFT creator?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "I guess. I mean, for me it was easy. You know, I was in the crypto space around like 20 1718 kind of nice. Played around with it like everybody else, just being curious about it, you know, had some good times, had some tough times, lost money, made some money. So was always curious about the space and to learn more. So just, you know, engaging with different people and over time and just kind of staying in the, like, the know, all of just, you know, what's going on in this space, you know, I kind of, like, fell in love with NFTs once I understood what they were, you know, just from a, you know, it's a familiar place, you know, as a kid, you always have, you know, basketball, cars with Pokemon cards, collectibles in general, like if it's toys or if it's comics. So that was a familiar way, you know, for me to get into the space. And same thing with the NFTs that I dropped you. You know, I used to collect shoes. So, you know, naturally it was a good, you know, partnership, you know, and it was something that was simple and fun, you know, I didn't want it to be too complicated because I'm not, you know, expert in any space. So just something that I can get into that was fun, that was familiar. That was also a gateway for people who probably don't know what NFTs are, you know, but probably love shoes, you know, or, you know, the new game now is, you know, collecting shoes and selling them on a secondary market."

        "text": "So people just, you know, familiar with those, those spaces can kind of get into the this and kind of understand. So, like, kind of like a gateway. It's not, it's not too intimidating. It's something simple and fun, you know, and I wanted to do that. And I also wanted to have a physical utility tied to that. You know, I wanted to take those actual sales, my percentage for those sales for those shoes, to buy actual physical shoes for kids in my community and also have people come in, whether it's a, in the real time, what, not real time in the physical, or whether it's by something like this, and just talk to the kids in my community to teach them about crypto, nfts, blockchain as a whole."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So that's really awesome. I think you made a couple really great points there. One, the utility is fantastic, right? We've seen a lot of celebrities or well off people come in and drop nfts that don't really have an impact like that. So to hear that that's kind of what you're doing with those proceeds, that's really awesome. And that is, you know, attractive for people to get involved with and the other piece I thought was really interesting, and it's kind of what, you know, gets me about the whole NFT space and collectibles in general is the nostalgia piece. Right? Like you mentioned, you know, going back in the days where you used to collect and trade Pokemon and, you know, sneakers and things like that. I think the nostalgia piece of is what is so attractive to me about the space. It's because it's just so much fun, right? Like, you know, I got into crypto around the same time as you, 2017, and I believe we're around the same age. I think I'm actually a year older than Wilson Chandler, which is kind of weird to think about, but to me, it was like, and I've spent the last couple of years messing around, doing things like trading and, you know, things I'm not good at and don't love as much. And I think this is why I like the NFT piece so much. It's because it's fun, right? And I think you hit that right on the head chamber. Any thoughts there?"

How am I five years older than Wilson Chandler? This is impossible. But I look at guys now where, you know, I'm a big la guy. Like, look at guy like Taylor Horton Tucker. It's like 20 years old. I've been watching him for, like, two years. I feel like he's, like, my age. I'm like, this guy could be my son. It's crazy. All this time, man. I'm oldest time."

        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, no, it was a, which I didn't understand at first. I thought it was kind of like a normal sneaker drop where, you know, you drop and you got to be the first ones to get it. It was actually cool. And I think to your benefit, and the proceeds benefit that you did it, like, an auction style. So they went on the auction block, and then there it was pretty quick how quickly it ended, but it was awesome. And I'm sure you got, Wilson, you got plans to drop some more releases from this kind of series."

So, Wilson, to catch you up, we all, on a very lonely Saturday afternoon, decided that we were going to be land barons and bought a whole bunch of land in sandbox, which is similar to crypto voxels. Kind of like pixelated creation like this. And we bought it. And then that moment of, oh, shit, what do we do with it? What do we do with our land? And the first thing I went to was, like, something like this where you can sell these, like, it would be in a real life shoe store, but then you go play a pickup basketball game in the metaverse, and you get to rock these, or you trade in your moment, your NBA top shot moment, and you get the jersey of whatever moment that was, and you can rock that and play it. And so, yeah, I just, I think that's a really cool aspect. And that's what attracted me to these so quickly is like, oh, yeah, we can actually use these in the metaverse."

Sorry about that. Got a phone call, and I couldn't charge my computer in time, but, yeah, those guys are super easy to work with. We spent a lot of time just going back and forth over the details. It was pretty easy. They had everything already built out. So I just kind of gave my two cent on, like, how we gonna sell them colorways, different designs, stuff like that, all the easy stuff."

You know, they was already a great company before I came around, so it was super easy, you know, and I think it's something to be proud of on my end. Like I said, I'm not like a professional or expert in this space. You know, I just wanted to create something that looked good, that was fun, that was easy, that people who were, like, interested in NFTs or people who were interested but wasn't necessarily in, just kind of like, come over just from a sneaker standpoint and just like, oh, what's this? You can kind of dive in gateway, you know?"

So, Wilson, did in your NFT journey, were you, did, were you kind of in how all of a, you know, a huge amount of people got in via top shot or was your first kind of NFT experience with Zed? What, you know, what was that? And, and, like, where do you participate in top chart? Are you into it? Why, why not let us know what you think there."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "My first introduction was, like, from a participation standpoint, I knew about NFTs and kind of read up on them, knew what they were. I knew different types of NFTs, but Zed was my first actual time, like, getting in, buying one and using it, you know? And that, for me, is fun. Like, to be able to have a horse, not only can you race it, you can breed it, you know, you can let it sit there, whatever, like, and that's a, it's fun, but it's an asset, you know, for sure, kind of building your portfolio in that, in the Zed space, you know? So for me, it's easy. Like, I can have fun with it. The interaction with the community is great. You know, the founders are great to, you know, to follow, you know, they lead in a great way, being innovative in a space. And I think it's just like, it's super young as a, as a company, so much they can do, and they expand on, like, the great things they've done already."

When you guys were at Brooklyn together, was he in the locker room talking everyone's ear off about, like, crypto? And I don't know when he started investing in top shot, but was he in the locker room just running his mouth about all this stuff? And everyone was like, no, I don't care about that."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "No, I wouldn't say running his mouth, but he definitely was very vocal about it. Loving the space and being an investor in this space, you know, I think he was very proud of that. I mean, as he should be, because he was one of the early. Yeah, one of the earliest ones. And on top of that, he can sit here and have a conversation with anybody in the space, you know, and be impressive, you know, not because he's there, but just because he's smart and he knows. So, you know, even with me, like, I understood the space, but to the depth that he knew it, and he understood it not. Not nearly as much. You know, I was always impressed, you."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Know, whenever he talked about the space, he was chamber. Do you remember on our other show, we were reading articles about Spencer Dinwiddie, talking about, like, tokenizing player contracts and all that kind of stuff? Like, we're talking about, he's talking about that stuff. So that's no surprise. So, uh, Wilson, while he pulls that up, you know, we saw a couple other stories today and yesterday, too, about more professional athletes kind of getting involved in crypto, whether that be getting their salaries paid in crypto or we saw Trevor Lawrence sign some big deal with, with blockfolio, you know, in your, in your experience, kind of around, you know, professional sports, do you see, you know, more and more guys that might becoming. Starting to do that in the future? And what are your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, definitely. I mean, it only makes sense from both sides, actually. Like, marketing is everything, you know, crypto, nfts, all that is hot right now. So just even from, like, a branding standpoint, you know, it kind of brings attention to the player. But like I said about Zed, it's an actual, like, you know, store value now. It's an actual, like, thing. Like, you can't deny it anymore. So I can see more and more people getting into the space just from a finance standpoint and also on both sides with players and teams for fan engagement, you know, personal branding as well. So I can see players getting more into it and accepting cryptos as payment and also getting into the NFT space, whether that's investing in companies or creating your own nfts for your."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Oh, you're lord and savior, Sam from FTX. There you go. But, yeah, I think it's going to be a bigger and bigger thing. And there's just, I think the sports business as a whole has such a huge opportunity to do things with NFTs specifically. I think mostly that's because what we're going to see the most successful people do is engage their community and use it to be creative on how they engage their community, how they can take that to the next level. They already have built in fan bases, right. So they have the communities that they are struggling to touch now that this could potentially give them that, you know, push over the edge. What do you think about that, Des?"

It's not just a single owner, but it's a group of owners, it's a group of friends, and it requires just a little bit of maintenance for them, but they still get the excitement and the thrill of winning a race or having a great horse. And I think that's going to be so big for how Zed expands is the people who maybe don't have 4 hours a day to do all the analytics and race horses, but still want that feeling of having ownership of something really awesome. So I think that makes total sense, and I think that's where it's going. I think it's a group game. I think it's a community. And what you're going to see is these big staples come together and have a whole bunch of.

And, you know, however much you own is your share of either the governance or the profitability of whatever happens.

So say you, you know, you could do it the same way almost totally defi where you have the pool, right? You're providing liquidity to the pool so people can come in and out and buy, trade ownership. And then as much as you're staking, you would get rewards based on that or whatever, right? You know, groups like, there's definitely social tokens out there, like the whale token that have things like that. So, you know, I know it's out there.

There's a lot of other good stuff that they want to get going, like sponsorships. We talked about big races. It's funny, you know, purses for these races are relatively small to how much people are paying for these horses. And I can see that being one of the things that, you know, changes. The soonest is, you know, some sponsor comes in and goes, we're going to do a $20,000 purse for a class one race that's going to turn heads as soon as that, you know, that headline on Yahoo.

Right. Like it used to be. I was keeping a manual. Just a month ago, I was keeping a manual spreadsheet with all my odds, and I was trying to do it that way.

So my theory is that zabos were meant for something different. They were meant for either jump racing or the next evolution of racing. So they have, like, a little thing that's hidden that no one can see that's just going to explode as the racing explodes. So I don't know, maybe hold on to those. Maybe keep those unraced, unbreden. When they pop off, you'll, you know, you'll, you know, end up with a nice come up there. But I do. I mean, I do. I'm a big fan of racing, and I think you should race a lot of your horses. I think, you know, you said someone was offering you some horses if those were z eight s to z ten s, or even, like, z five s to z seven s. Like, maybe snatch up a couple of those, feel good about racing them, see where they are. But it's funny, the value, if you just talk about it from a fun standpoint, obviously, it's more fun to race. But if you talk about a value standpoint, if you get a winner, it's much more advantageous than just keeping it unraced and whatnot.

Your point there about racing them versus unraced is a good one, because I do think that even I, if it's not a good racer, it will eventually, down the line be, if it's a Genesis horse, be good for something, right? And I think if it's a Genesis horse, it might even might be a breeder or there's a whole bunch of stuff that aren't unlocked in the racing algorithm yet that we might see it be good at.
