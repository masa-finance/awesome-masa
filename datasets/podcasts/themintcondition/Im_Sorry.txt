Speaker A: Hey, everybody, chamber here. I know you're expecting a fresh new mid mic crisis this week, but I'm an idiot. And during our livestream, I was pulling audio from the wrong source. So my audio is absolute trash and I'm very upset. I'm at maximum rage level right now, and it's probably gonna ruin the week for me. So just wanted to put out this little note. So message to the listeners out there apologizing. I know you're all waiting so diligently every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for a new show of nonsense and laughter. Just know that I'm fuming with rage. My rage knows no bounds at this point, and I'm about to flip a table. So I apologize again. I hope you all have a great week and will be back soon with a brand new show. And hopefully I'm not an idiot. You guys would have really liked this episode, too. It was really, really good. But I'm an idiot. And because of that, you don't get any of that. So don't forget to like and subscribe. Leave a comment five star rating and we'll see you next week.
