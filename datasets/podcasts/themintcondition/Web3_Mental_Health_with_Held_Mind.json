You had actually texted me about this and, I don't know, a couple hours ago, and it was the third time somebody had told me about it today, and that was my signal. So I bought a couple. This is a open edition. There's already like 26,000 minted. They're like $8 a pop. But. So don't go fomoing into something like this. However, I know somebody who bought like a thousand of these things and they're. And there's, you know, might be worth an $8 flyer here or there watching what happened with checks. So I bought some.

    {
        "speaker": "H",
        "text": "Yeah, sure. So I'll try and keep this sweet and synced. I am from the UK. You can probably tell from my accent. I'm a licensed psychotherapist and I got into web three just over a year ago, and I was really struck that there were lots of kind of mental health spaces, bits and pieces in discords about mental health, but not always being done in the most kind of intentional way, in the most safe way, not moderated by licensed professionals. And I always say the minute you title something mental health, you are inviting vulnerability. So I got together with a group of guys in the states, Doug, Aaron, Dave and Seth, and we created held mind and we are a project dedicated to looking after people's mental health and sobriety in the space. We have a whole team of licensed mental health professionals from all across the world and experts in their own lived experience of sobriety. And we try to keep people safe in our confidential ticketed system. In our discord, we consult with other teams and projects in the space on how to look after their team's mental health, their holder's mental health, how to resolve conflict in their discords. And we also, in a more kind of business to business way, we deliver training to mental health professionals on web three. So how to understand web three because we don't believe that people who do go to therapy and have the privilege of being able to access therapy should be teaching their therapist about the space because that's their paid for time that could be used in a different way."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "That's super fascinating. I love that last part, too, as far as educating other therapists on the space, because I feel like, you know, sometimes we're speaking another language half the time, as far as, you know, some people outside of our day to day chaos here, and they, you know, it's probably very difficult to understand if you're not coming from a place of understanding, so, of the space. So I think that's really cool. Talk a little bit about the community alliance that you guys have, how it works, what people who are part of that have the. Have access to through you guys?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "H",
        "text": "Yeah. So from our discord, we do a mental health alliance, which is a discord to discord channel that sends curated content to our alliance partners channels. So that can be motivational quotes, insights into different aspects of mental health. Sometimes we share articles, we share reminders of access to crisis, help helplines internationally all across the world. And we just try and keep mental health alive within those people's servers so that people, so it's normalized to kind of destigmatize the taboo so that people know, hey, we're here, you can always come and talk to us. And sometimes it actually starts a conversation in those other discords, whereas people may not have wanted to do that before. So that's what our alliance offers in terms of content, and we tend to kind of pivot content to what's happening in the space. So, for example, when the FTX crash happened, we were very quick to kind of rally the troops and get some content out because we knew that some people were really, really hurting and feeling super vulnerable at that time. Sometimes Aaron posts out about maintaining sobriety in his own journey. With that and the kind of road that that's been, we know that there are lots of people in the space that struggle with that grief and loss is another one that we've pivoted to. We've seen a big kind of uprising in that with COVID and whatnot recently. So, yeah, that's what our alliance does. And we also, again, you know, pop into spaces like this when we're allied with projects to keep spreading the word, keep thinking about mental health. And you guys at DjEn Network do it in such an intentional way. So it's a real gift to be allied with you guys."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I appreciate that. And I think what you just said about, you know, opening up the conversation is really true. Right? Like we had you come into the Degen discord and spend, you know, 40 minutes with us just chatting about everything and kind of kicking off the alliance that we have together. And it definitely sparked conversations and I think it inspired some people to take some, some actions, and so it definitely sparked that conversation. And, you know, you don't really think about it sometimes until you're, you're kind of forced into thinking about where you fit in that conversation of your own mental health. And so I think it's really awesome what you guys are doing. I really love the, I love the aspect of the discord ticketing system that you have. So you touched on it briefly, but as a member of the alliance through DGEn. So, for example, if you have a Degen network warm pass, you can kind of for free go into the heldmind discord. And if you need to speak with somebody, you can open a confidential ticket and, you know, talk to some, talk to a professional. Can you talk about kind of what your experience has been with that? I think it's so incredible. Such an incredible thing to offer, you know, how has that been? Where did that idea come from, I guess. And how has that been so far for you guys?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "H",
        "text": "I think the idea came from. I have kind of experience of working on crisis helplines within the National Health service here in the UK. We were seeing kind of people wanting to reach out in a less overt way within our general channels. And sometimes people were in a genuine crisis and they really did need emergency help and direction to in real life care. So it's not therapy. We cannot deliver therapy in the space legally at the moment, but our ticketed system gives you access to licensed professionals who can help with anything. You know, we've had over 100 tickets open. We very rarely close our tickets unless someone asks us to because people might pop back with updates or just to say, hey, can I just have some space to share something? And we've had everything. We've had people who have had their bags wrecked and they've lost, you know, all of their money. They've overexposed themselves. And we've had people who felt comfortable enough to share their in real life locations. We have called emergency services to people's homes via the locations they've been happy to share with us because they needed crisis help there and then, and they did not know how to access that. It's really difficult sometimes to reach out for help when you are in a crisis. We've also walked people through the process of accessing other crisis help and support and reassured them that they won't be judged, blamed or shamed and sent them to help that we know is safe. We've had people who are struggling in their marriages. We've had people who are struggling with their work and their social lives. We've had people asking questions about mental health diagnoses and they wanted some answers and some signposting. Honestly, I think we've had just about everything and it's a real privilege to be able to provide that in a safe way and we hope that we can keep providing that. That's our plan."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "H",
        "text": "Yeah. So we are all volunteers. We funds, we fund whatever we need to ourselves. We all have in real life jobs. We do have a kind of paid branch of what we do in terms of some of the wider team consultation that we do. If people want kind of more tailored training for their team, then we offer that as kind of paid service. And obviously, the in real life training that we offer to web three, from web three to mental health professionals is a paid for training, because we do, we would like to pay our mods and our staff. That's our goal. And obviously, you know, therapists work a lot of the time and many therapists, myself included, struggle to say, you know, yeah, I, to kind of ask for payment for services. But we do want to pay the therapists on board our team because they are still offering a really important service. So over time, we will be kind of scoping that out in a bit of a different way in terms of how can we keep a revenue stream coming in and we're not a not for profit, but we will never be as such a kind of for profit, if that makes sense."

And the most difficult thing, the most difficult starting point is to ask for help. I would say check in with yourself. You know, it's okay to ask. And even if you just reach out to one of the communities that you're in or you can reach out to us, we're not making you docs, you can be perfectly anonymous in the confidential ticket. But please, all I will always say is reach out for help. Don't go it alone. You don't have to be alone, you don't have to be afraid. There are always people here that will listen."

        "speaker": "B",

So if you don't have that, if you're finding yourself feeling like you're alone and don't have that community in the space, I would, I would encourage you to seek it out. There's a lot of, if you're feeling that way, somebody else probably is as well. And, you know, I've known that from experience, so totally second that.
