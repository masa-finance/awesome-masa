That's like half the market cap. However, he does say, what's with the degenerate that locked 2% of the supply? Well, wouldn't you believe it, but the community takeover team, a bunch of us who hold a lot have been collecting and holding a bunch of the supply are going to be locking our tokens up in a Solana token locker and we're going to be doing that for, gosh, who knows, 30, 60, 90 days, I don't even know, six months. We don't care. We're just locking these tokens up where it is a signal that we ain't going anywhere. We're locking supply up to build some trust. We've had a lot of anxiety around people holding a bunch of supply. And what's more bullish than all of us locking it up and committing to the cause, I think west side crypto locked up 2% of the total supply. Wow. I'm going to lock up close to like ten, I think.
