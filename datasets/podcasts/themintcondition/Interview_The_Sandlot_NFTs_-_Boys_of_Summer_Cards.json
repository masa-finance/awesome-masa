So this show is, as you know, it's about digital collectibles and kind of bridging the gap between digital and physical. And we're the sports related as well. And before we get into anything, I'm really excited to check out what you have behind you. It looks like you've got a nice little physical collection right behind you."

So I myself have gotten into the memorabilia piece really lately as well. I like that almost, I think, more than, than cards at this point because it's just like we were talking about last week. It's, you know, more of a story behind stuff like that. Right. So, yeah. Are any of those musical instruments collectibles or. That's your own. That's your own collection?"

So excited. So let's think about what. What is the gap then, or the bridge between that physical stuff and then what you guys are doing? So you guys have the boys of summer coming out as a digital collectible and it launches on the. Or actually, I guess it's launched now and you can buy up until the 19th. Is that correct?"

Has hit the world pretty hard in the last, I would say, couple months here. So how did you guys, you know, what's the story behind boys of Summer? Where did it all originate from? How did you, you know, approach getting the guys on board, things like that?"

We've all got pictures, like, just these really awesome behind the scenes shots. And, I don't know, it's just, like, cool stuff. Like, it's a totally different perspective on the film. And, I don't know, just going through them, they're just. They're so awesome that we've always talked about, like, what can we do with these? How can we share these with the fans? But we didn't want to put them out in, like, I don't know, we just didn't want to put them out in the wrong way or just give up all of our pictures to somebody and let them have control. So now with that, this nft thing is happening. Like, that's one of the coolest things to me is that, like, the creators or the artists, like, have full control over what they're doing. And so this was, like, when this started going crazy, we go, I think this is the perfect opportunity to share this stuff."

It's so new and weird, and it's still, like, scary for a lot of people. I think it kind of feels like in the early days of, like, online shopping, like, when you were like, I'm gonna put my credit card into the Internet, and I don't know, like, is this stuff gonna show up at my house or not? Like, I feel like it's the same kind of vibe. So, you know, it took a little bit of convincing, but, you know, I think the fact that, like, the NBA is doing it and, like, there's some, like, really big, like, companies that are getting involved in it, there's some, I'm thinking, more confidence now around the NFT."

You can race them, breed them, buy them, sell them, and essentially it's a horse racing slash breeding game. You can bet on them, all of that kind of stuff. It's pretty entertaining.

So if people respond to it, if people like it, then we'll release some more stuff. But for this first one, we've got 40 pictures. And then as you can see right there, we got the three rarity levels.

Grant helped a little bit, so I'll give him some of the credit, but most of it actually goes to his wife. I mean, she did an incredible job with these."

You know, even, even just with, like, the garbage pail kids and the street fighter, too, and all that stuff, it's like, for sure. And we felt like we were in good company there."

More of a barrier to entry, I think, for regular people that just want to collect some cards. But I think wax is probably one of the easier platforms to use. I mean, I'll help you out a little bit here, Vic, but I mean, just getting that wax wallet is pretty easy. If you have, like, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, Gmail, you. You can get a wax wallet. It's very easy to get. So much easier than, like, setting up a metamask on Ethereum."

Just for like, the average person that doesn't really know a lot about the NFTs. They've heard about it there. Maybe interested in getting into it. It's. It's that. It's really that first purchase, like, once you get your first set of cards or whatever it is, it's like, then it just becomes really easy and it makes sense. But, yeah, it's like signing up for the wallet and what is this? And. And just that whole process of getting everything logged in and connected. But then it's super easy after that."

Because I think when you bring in these, like, cult followings, what you want to do is give them access into the people that mean so much to it, meaning you, the actors and stuff.

You even mentioned it earlier when you were originally doing this. You didn't know what it was gonna turn into, right. You obviously couldn't have known it was gonna be this cult classic. When.

But again, it's like, you just never know what is going to happen afterwards. And for me, it was like, it wasn't, like, a huge success in the theaters. And I think it took a little while to really catch on anyway in popularity. So for me, it was like the 20th anniversary was the first time that, like, Fox reached out to us and tried to, like, they brought us back to Salt Lake City where we filmed it to the original sandlot, a couple, like, little kind of promotional things. And that's when we realized, because we would show up at a place and they'd go, yeah, we think there's gonna be a thousand people, maybe 1500. And then, like, 15,000 people would show up really well. And that's when we were like, wow, this. Like, I don't think any of us realized the impact that the film had until then."

And I think that's kind of what nostalgia does, right, Des? We keep going back to nostalgia, and I think that's. That's a big piece of it. So I remember the first time I ever watched it. I was at somebody's birthday party, and we were, like, sleeping over their house, and that was the first time I ever watched it. I'll never forget it. And I don't know why I had to watch it recently, actually, because my wife had never seen it, and so I. I had to show her the sand lot, and I. We watched it, I don't know, maybe a month ago. So I was like, oh, let's do it. Cool. So. And she hates sports, so, like, she was like, oh, I can't believe we're gonna watch this movie. And then she loved it, so."
