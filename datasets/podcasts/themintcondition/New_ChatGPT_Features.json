This thing is absolutely ridiculous. Like, some of the things I've seen come out of this are incredible. So the TLDR of what it is is it basically allows you to set up a coding environment behind the scenes in which you can just now drop files in there, say you had an Excel spreadsheet or something of a bunch of data. You could actually upload this file and just say things like, visualize me something cool about this data, and it'll start printing charts for you. It'll tell you all about the data you have. It can run like models for you, it can do all kinds of cool stuff. I want to see if I could pin one that I saw from more of a creative side here. This one was from Chris, Chris Castanova. She's a creator with generative AI. And check out what she did with this. She had, this was code interpreter in chat GPT. This took her five minutes to make this game. She wrote a small prompt and it kind of just built this and ran the program for her, and she built this little asteroid game in five minutes. And it's doing all this for you. And the way it's doing it is it's setting up this, like, kind of self contained docker container of your own kind of python notebook, and it's just runs."

So, one thing related to crypto, nfts, not nfts, but crypto, you can remember I said that you. That you can upload a file. So yesterday I decided, oh, I wonder if this thing can help me make my trading bot better. And so I went and I grabbed documentate or a file from Kraken, which had all of the five minute history of Ethereum USDT trading. It has, you know, your open, high, low close candles, all the trading volume, all that kind of stuff. I uploaded it and I said, analyze this data and find me three profitable, moving, average trading strategies. And it took all the data in and it suggested strategies for me. And I was like, okay, now assume there's a fee every time you trade. Here's the fee, blah, blah, blah. Test the results on this. If you started with a $10,000 trading budget from 2015, what's your total profitability? And it tells you, and if you had a profitable one, you could have it, then code you the trading strategy. And so I'm going to be using it to upgrade my bots. I'm using it to clean data for my sports betting model, and there's a whole bunch of other stuff you can use it for outside of data analytics. It'll write you code, it executes code inside of it, which means that it can actually, like before, if you were just using chat GPT to code, it would write you code, but you would never know really if it worked or not until you went and tried to run it on yourself. But it can actually execute code in here. So you could say, I want to do x, y and z, write me a script and test it. And if it doesn't work, it finds out why it doesn't work, really iterates itself and it won't work. It's pretty crazy."

It'll test it. And if you can't, if it can't, it'll just do it till it works. Like, I've seen some really cool things about more. More art. Like, it can actually create videos out of your mid journey artwork. People are creating QR codes. I saw a very cool use case of, say, we have the night shift tonight, and you want to break the night shift down into the YouTube video, down into three small videos for YouTube shorts. You paste the link in there. You paste the link in there and say, convert this video into four two minute YouTube shorts, and it'll really, it'll create you new videos that you can download. The other cool thing is, like, you can upload a file, but you can have it, like, manipulate the file for you, and then ask it for something you can download back so it can change your file, and then you can download it back and you've got it all fixed or whatever you were doing to it, which is pretty cool. And, like, the one I, what did I just mention before the. Oh, so, like, the YouTube video one is really interesting. You could also do a YouTube video where you just said, hey, extract the. Extract the transcript from this YouTube video and print me this, you know, text file with just the transcript, and it'll do it in, like, seconds."

It's really interesting. So if you have chat QPT and you have not tried this out yet, I would recommend doing it. Watch a couple YouTube videos to get your mind going on all the stuff you could do. And it's pretty cool because you actually get to see it work in real time. You get to see it think through and reason what it's doing and it tells you what it's doing.

        "text": "So check this out. So the way I'm using it now is I'm actually, there's this great website out there. It's called college footballdata.com. and the hardest part for me was like, I'm not a data scientist. I've never done any of this stuff before. So the hardest challenge for me was like getting good, clean data that you could use. And this website, college football data, allows you to download everything to a CSV, which is really cool. That was like the first step. And then I was getting stuck on like how to clean data because I don't know how to do that. I've never had to do it before and it would like, holding me up. It took me a week or two to figure out kind of like what that all even meant and how to do it and things like that, and I still was running into trouble. I take these CSVs, I throw them into here, I'm like, hey, clean this data to prepare for a model. It walked me through everything I have, everything that I should be doing, and then it just does it for me and it'll spit back out a clean data CSV that I can now use to train a model off of. And so the next thing I did was, hey, what are the top five best methods to predict a college football outcome? And it was like, here's a list of models you could try to run. I was like, all right. And so I'm like, okay, let's take this and train a neural network on it with a target of predicting the margin of victory on each game. And that's where I'm at right now. But it actually coded. Like, it coded the neural network for me. And all I have to do is put this damn CSV in and it will train it on, you know, the data. I have to try to make the prediction. And my early results were pretty cool. There's some stuff that I definitely did wrong. So I'm going back to the drawing board, but I way over fit the model, meaning I basically, through the data, kind of gave it the answer. So everything actually looks like it's making the right prediction. And obviously that's not the case, or else I would be very, very rich. But point is, once I get to a point where I can create the model, which is where I'm doing now, the idea is to create a model that will help me predict margin of victory to some degree of confidence. Then I'm going to build something that will, like, compare that to the lines of the games. And based on that, what are the best opportunities? And then what I'd love to do is put a chat bot on that where it's like, I could share it with the DJ network and you could Jweb, go find me the best five plus EV bets for college football this weekend, and it would spit you out results based on it. Knowing my data, which is pretty cool. So that's my goal with this thing. But the other thing would just be cool. I keep thinking about from a sports angle is like the hardest thing for, like, a handicapper or somebody who's going to bet a game is like the research, right? There's data all over the place. It's not, you know, you don't really know what's good, what's not. But imagine if you could just come and I had just this massive, massive data set for you to, and you could just chat with it, like, oh, show me. Show me the five latest trends for the New York Giants, and it would spit it out to you. And it makes the research thing part of it all so much easier. So those are my goals with the sports betting stuff. What else do I need to build for you, Jay?"

The research side, for sure, because there's so many factors that people don't take into account, whether it's weather, whether it's officiating, and how that can move a total or a spread. I, you know, let's, let's get this going for baseball, too, right? Like, there's a big sample size now. We could, you know, we could start, start tweaking this thing during the, the back half of the baseball season. So if you need a guinea pig to follow your bets here to track progress, you just let me know."

But, like, in time, if I started with baseball, I'd be too late for football. So my thought was learn for the football, and then I could have it ready for, like, you know, to replicate this for, like, NBA and college basketball and things like that. So I don't know if I'll start or if I'll do baseball until probably next year. Cause I want to get ahead of the upcoming sports. But that's the goal, is to make something that, like, you know, it'd be really great if it makes, you know, super accurate predictions and you could win 60% of your bets and you're, you know, that's profitable as a sports bettor. I mean, 53 and a half percent is profitable as a sports bettor. And so if you're, if you got a model that can do that, you're in good shape. That's very hard to do. But, like, the fact that you might be able to, like, chat with this incredible ocean of data that people struggle with to find, you know, any nugget of edge is really interesting to me. So that's kind of what I'm, my goals are for that chamber. What do you think you may get some bets this year?"

It reminds me of, like, a couple years ago, I don't know, maybe even before we started podcasting, I was having, like, a mental breakdown. And the reason I was having this mental breakdown a long one. It was, was because I came to the conclusion that there's no free will, that basically all decisions are predetermined or not predetermined, but could be predicted. If we had big enough computers and enough data. So enough data and enough computing power, you could basically predict what everybody would do. And this just kind of is bringing up a lot of those thoughts. How far away from AI being able to do some serious predicting? And again, this is all too a percentage point, 91% probability. Is it a 78% probability? Like, these types of probabilities, you can really start dialing them in and kind of do long term predictions. So, yeah, it's fine. I'm sure it's fine. And I'm sure there'll be a nice window to make some money on football. But then, I don't know, does betting go away? Because we can basically just predict the outcomes and there's basically zero.

Right, but, so, but that's why spreads exist, right? Because you, you basically are creating a different market based on, you know, how good or bad a team is, and, you know, maybe everybody will be able to get predict spreads, but I don't think that's the case. Right. Because, like, even if you could build a model, right, like, even if I figure out how to build a model, my model is not going to be right 100% of the time because football is chaos. Right?

Now, now the difference is, like, if you're talking about building a product out of something like this is like, okay, you. You could build a really accurate football model and sell access to it. Because I still don't think everyone in their mother is going to have a football model. You know what I mean? You're going to get a casual person or whatever, people that don't want to do it themselves. So, like, the way you would make money on this thing is probably until they flag you bet your heart away. And then after that, you kind of have to, like, sell it as a tool or something.

But it gives, it's democratizing intelligence, which is commoditizing intelligence for dollar 20 a month. I am a data scientist all out of nowhere, right?

You put that in a zip file, upload the zip file, and now all ten are in your code interpreter thing where if you individually, you can only upload one file and it only works in context of that. But if you do it with a zip file, you can look cool. Yeah. The other thing too is like, think about the pro. One of the drawbacks of it right now is like, it only works in the context it has for a small amount of time, whether it's the context window being limited to the eight k and you run out of context window and you got to kind of start over or say it actually time out after a certain amount of minutes, right. Meaning it won't remember all of the context that it was already working with. So say you got a phone call, you had to step away for an hour or whatever, whatever, and you come back, it might not, it might have timed out, but you could actually ask it to give you a transcript and export it in a text file.

I've never done built anything with it. But the second I've been able to build something that worked for myself, it opened this whole new world of possibilities to me where in the sense of, I can now create something for myself. And this is the point I was making before about how I think, yes, it's going to disrupt a lot of jobs, but it's also going to create so many opportunities that it's going to take a one man team to do something it would have normally taken ten people to do. Meaning, Mark, you could build some very cool volleyball application that, you know, is utilizing. It's built on this technology, and once you know what the capabilities are of this stuff, you can start, like, literally your mind will open and sky's the limit and you won't run out of ideas, but you'll need to then be able to kind of hack them together a little bit. And you can do that just by talking to it. So I would, I would push back and say, like, it's not a field. As my answer, my answer would be, learn how to interact with this stuff to produce outcomes that are interesting to you. Right. So, like, for me, I started with this sports betting thing because it's something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to learn how to code. I've tried ten times times. I never could get myself to do it. This makes it easier. I've tried to learn how to build my own model a million times in the last ten years and I've never been able to do it. And now I can. And, like, it starts opening your mind to all of these possibilities of things you can do. And so, like, I think my answer would be less about a field you should go into and more about learning how to create output with this stuff, because something there will ignite a passion in you and you might be able to create your own way."

You're going to find, I think, because this thing is so good at generating generic content, not even just from the content creation side, but you'll find that there's going to be a need and want from authentic content. And so whether it's media creation or not, that's just the tool that's going to help you get to the end results faster.

There was a period where she was gonna go back to work. It doesn't look like. I don't know if she can. This is also the one that's dating. I forget the fake name we gave him. Kevin. Yes."

My sister, I want to do something to help her. So we had some mediocre success when it came to Amazon stuff and creating streams of income. And I'm wondering, I know the answer. I'm positive I can create and maybe I'll have a project for myself here, but basically an automated AI kind of stream of income that I want to kind of create for her to kind of generate additional income because some of these freaking things. She asked me the other day if $12,000 was too much for like a utility chair. And I was like, this is how much they're charging you for stuff. So, yeah, just a way to provide her some, some additional income. You know, I would front all kind of upfront costs for, you know, merchandise and stuff like that. But the income it generates, I'd like to send her away, but I think we can do that."
