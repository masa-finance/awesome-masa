Take the accessory in the charging port. So I went and finally bit the bullet today, got myself a new phone. Top of the line, state of the arts, iPhone 14 pro Max. So, like, literally. Yeah.

And then actually, when I left my last company, I just never sent this one back. So I kind of. I just swapped the sim card out and it became my phone. And so the. I haven't bought myself a phone in very long time. The last phone I had is a eleven. So we're on like, three iterations ago. Yeah. And I'll tell you, like, the size of my old phone versus this new one is night and day, and. But I am justifying it, which I think is very fair. I spend like 90% of every day on this thing, and it is basically the source of all my work. Like, everything I do is digital, whether it's forum, 3d, gen, personal stuff. I spend so much time on my phone, it's worth it for me to have, you know, a decent one. And I. I'm a sucker, though. Like, I am the Apple best customer.

We're actually doing a contest for DGEn network war room passes. So like, retweet above and watch that amazing video. You can win a Degen network. De Genesis passed. I gotta say, chamber, you sent this video at around 03:00 and I have been buzzing ever since. If you haven't watched it yet, give it a watch and I'll tell you why I'm so happy and proud of it. But first, I want to get your take on it as the person who pretty much made it all happen. Yeah, I mean, you coordinated, you coordinated all the equipment. You cor, you rallied up the troops.

A test run for some of the guys, see what worked, what didn't work, what we're going to use going into VCoM. But I was super impressed with it. Ken was working diligently on it and pieced together this little mini movie. Nice recap video. I was thoroughly pleased. I did not get any FOMO. You just see all the people. No, I was happy.

When Steve presented us a PowerPoint, like a total nerd, he, you know, we had this vision of like, hey, we can have all these shows, we can have a community. We can do, like, fun content. And one of the things that we talked about was like, oh, yeah, we can go to all these conferences and irl events and just kind of like, shoot what's happening in our experience and just follow our creators around and stuff. And, like, this is the stuff we talked about being able to do and produce. And it's really the first time we've been able to pull something like this off. And I know it's just like, to most people, a silly two minute video of riggs getting people to draw a dick on his book. But, like, to me, it's really a point of pride of, like, what we've built over these two years. And it's just so, so cool to see this all come together. So thank you for coordinating it all. Thank you, Mister House. Thank you, Dow Jones. It's just super, super cool to see. And it's like, it feels like it's just the beginning of the next kind of step in what we're doing here.

But now what I came up for was upon hearing with chambers tomfoolery and editing the podcast, and not leaving it in its true state of unarchived providence, I have a feeling if we conducted an audit, that we would go back and find out that this is not the mint condition. This is just the chamber show. So anytime one, two says something smarter, insightful, it just cuts out and goes straight to chambers punchline. So it's just like, I got a feeling. We come back Friday, we do the audit of the main condition. It's really just become chambers dark twisted fantasy."

And specifically last week, Ryland, when we were talking about music, suggested a very good draft. And then Ryland took the time to. Which I think you saw. Right timber in the."

And so I want to cover this with you and anybody who's out there listening, because if you want to participate Friday, you could throw your hat in the ring now, and we will save you a spot on stage on Friday. So just let us know if we got to make sure we have enough participants. But Ryland put out this very, very cool write up. So I want to check with you, chamber, on this live to see, one, are we good to go with this on Friday? And two, if there's any changes you would make to this. So here's Ryland's proposal for our draft on Friday. Traditional snake style draft with three main rounds, plus a bonus fourth round if time allows. The round one through three. Again, remember, if you were listening last week, the idea was that we would draft not only bands, but we would actually create a show lineup, essentially. So rounds one through three, the opening band. So this is a smaller band that complements the rest of the lineup. The middle slot, so low key headliner, probably the real best band, but not the headliner. And then the third round would be your headliner. So that's the big draw that would bring in your crowd. Fourth bonus category, if time allows, is the venue. And he says there should be thought put into the progression of the show, and otherwise, you don't want to draft Tom Petty as your opener for Blink 182. That's. That's the strategy. If you want to win the draft, you got to get. You got to get that. That cohesion, he says. Then he says, important time travel chip. You have one time travel chip that can be used in any of the categories for this. You can name a year or era for the band. So you must use your time travel chip if you choose a band with dead members that you want to join. And that's very interesting."

So, like, the example here is, I think, pretty clear. If. If you choose journey and use your time travel trip to 1981, so you could basically, you know, put a band at their peak. Right. You get don't stop leaving. Or you could choose 2023 Journey and get their current greatest hits iteration with the filipino guy on the vocals. So. Right, right. So, yes, your current year, if you don't use your time travel trip, which I think is a fun way to do this, you are getting the current iteration of all those bands, I think. I like that strategy that puts in there. So what do you think? You signing off on this for Friday?"

So if you don't know, Moonbirds today announced or yesterday, I don't know when it was. I think it was late yesterday, announced their ten member inaugural community council. These members were nominated by holders to present the wants, needs and desires of the proof and Moonbirds community. So the best part of this was that they were all nominated. So speaks to the very high character that those individuals have. So very cool. The council will meet bi weekly with proof leadership to give feedback, share ideas, keep an open line of communication between proof and the community. It was interesting coffee with Captain this morning. They had Forrest come up, who kind of organized and executed the council selection and things like that. And he was talking about how kind of these calls will go, and he said it's like 80% community feedback ideas, all of that kind of great stuff. And then probably about 20% of them pitching the proof team, pitching them and updating them on what's new and what's coming and details of what's going on in the project to be an extension of the team outside in the wild, which is pretty cool. The new community council total has ten members, as we mentioned. Three of them are DGen folks. So congratulations to those. And it's, it's pretty interesting. We've seen, you know, a couple of these community councils formed in the past. Other projects like Gutter Cat gang at a community council, Doodles has a community council and it's interesting. We'll see how this one goes. I haven't seen, I mean, apes obviously have a community council and the apecoin Dow. Are you bullish on these community councils in general chamber?"

Just helps keep the information flowing in both directions as far as feedback and disseminating the information down to the holders. I think you also have a layer of maybe initial feedback that you can utilize before making a misstep. Specifically in the case of proof and moonbirds where you can say, hey, this is what we're thinking. Council, what are your thoughts? And you can avoid missteps, I think, by having a council to kind of pitch ideas off of, especially if you're very close to the end of making that decision."

And that's not to say that you're going to kind of placate to everything they want. It's. But it's, it's sometimes, and I see this all the time in dealing with Odyssey. Right. There's just like layers to the program and there's, you know, the very top level. Sometimes they're executing these very big roadmap plans and there's a lot of things that go into that and it takes them out of kind of the day to day community sentiment sometimes. And I see it all the time with Odyssey and it's super, you know, I'm super fortunate to kind of be at the top and in the community very closely because we run the community with them. And so, you know, there's that direct tie and if, I'll tell you right now, if we didn't have that, like, it would just be the impact of having it, having that kind of immediate feedback loop that being able to understand what's working and what doesn't at that really deep like ground level is super important. So I think this will be a home run. Pumped for our friends and. Yeah. So onward community council for proof and moonbirds."

Do you remember like the t shirt jerseys? Yeah, yeah, there was. The t shirt jerseys were not, you know, that's maybe like back in like 2012, 2013 where they had like the long sleeve jerseys, they changed the ball. I don't know. If you, if you go back, I feel like back, it was like maybe like 0708, they actually changed the basketball to like this like slip resistant like material and it just made it slipper. And everybody hated and by like the 10th game of that season, like they got rid of it. But yeah, it's.

He usually fails and always seems to have something interesting to discuss. While you never know if you're going to get actual NFT content or some off topic debate, you always know it'll be something enjoyable to listen to. Chambers seems like he likes to play Devil's advocate and say the opposite of what he actually he thinks. I think he's a closet you the fanboy and knows deep down that the Celtics are way better than the Lakers. I'm hoping that last line was Trojan horsed in here far enough that chamber will read it on the show before realizing it because we know he ain't reading this ahead of time. Oh my God. Yes, mom. Anyway, I'm a big fan of the DJ of the show and like we, the guys at DJ network are building. Definitely the listen.

Of course, the HVMTL reveal is delayed until May, so the hvs will not be making their way across the reveal threshold until May, according to the official board ape yacht club Twitter account. So the Twitter account appeared to note the delay by cryptically saying, one turn right, one turn up, three down, two up. Fuck. Locked itself again. We'll need more time to figure this out. Wow, that's. That is cryptic. I would never. So that tells me that it's delayed till May. Of course, the actual site confirms the minor delay. And with the updated infographic now showing May rather than April. Besides, you know, another week or two of pent up anticipation. I don't really see too much here. No, you know, floors dropped across the board, but I don't know if it's because of the delay. It's just is what it is. So, um, that's all. But if you were waiting for that, it is not happening in the next week, so you can rest easy. But May is only a week away. May is only a couple days away. Isn't that crazy?"

So because I leave it up, I bank them sometimes and like, bring them to the next year. Like, I think in like 2023 I had like five weeks. So, yeah, so, yeah, I just don't take enough. So I took a week off of May. I'm getting my wisdom teeth out on Monday. So I'll have, you know, take a day off for that. I have, I only have two wisdom teeth. It's a weird thing. So I only have them on one side of my face, but yes, I have both of them. The only two I have are both coming out."

That's so weird. But. And then it also says it's an eleven ERC 1155. So definitely a scam. Thanks for jumping up and letting everybody know about it. And that's gonna do it for us. Chamber.
