And then we're going to talk specifically a little bit about a project that we're launching in conjunction with Djen Network and fantasy football related. So we're going to have our good friend premium carrots on for the last half and chat a little bit about that project and walk through it and see, you know, see what we got going on. I think it's a pretty interesting project here. So ape and pony show already asking when the kids are going to mint on the contract.

And whatnot and some real, like, deep stuff. It wasn't just, you know, when celebrities get in, it's very, I'm going to get a punk. I'm going to get a, you know, they weren't just talking about bitcoin and he was talking about some real. Some real. I think he was talking about farming pickles, if you. Which is a deep cut in the defi space. And I had reached out to him through our cryptocurrency show rec podcast to see if he wanted to come on. And he actually responded back. We chatted back and forth a little bit. I was losing my mind. I kept texting you right after, like, oh, like, look at this, look at this. And we, you know, he was, you know, there was a pretty good chance he was gonna come on our show. Obviously not anymore. But, yeah, it was, it was tough."

I mean, eth, you know, obviously, we just almost reached a new all time high, but we didn't quite get there, and then it dropped down and. But it's just still so funny because you get perspective. And like 3300 on ETH is still phenomenal. You know, just a few weeks ago, month ago, we were at 2000 and before that, 1700. So, you know, eth crypto, I think is still strong despite maybe what you would call, you know, a correction or just a small dip. I think it's just a tiny pullback before a slingshot, honestly.

I've been talking with a bunch of people and we are way oversaturated on new projects and people are starting to take losses, which I think for the overall health is actually pretty good because like I said, the cream rises to the top. I've kind of shortened my investment window into some major brands and major back products, good teams. And so I think we're actually approaching like a really, that's, of course, where chamber, you know, bounces out. You know, talking about good, steady investment metrics and chambers like peace."

In the last couple of weeks, NFTs really slowed down. Now, like that said, we were oversaturated. There was a ton of stuff going on on the NFT side. So, you know, it kind of met at an apex. And I think a lot of people were pivoting to either holding their crypto or, you know, flipping their NFTs for Ethereum. But the other thing we were seeing, too, is Solana really getting into NFTs. Say what you will, you know, I don't have any Solana NFTs personally, myself."

        "text": "So, well, I think I said, I don't know if it was the week before last, but it totally reminds me of pancakeswap, not in the sense that, like, it's a bad, you know, it's a bad product, but when it's free and it's easy, you get a lot of scammers that are going to participate on that. So Pancakeswap was the same. That was like a binance Dex, and a lot of, like, defi projects were launching on that. There was a ton of rug pulls there. So it does not shock me that we're seeing that on salon just because it's cheap and easy. So scammers can really, really take advantage. And if the sentiment is going that way, obviously you're gonna have a lot more participants. But I mean, for myself, I'm holding my nfts. I'm selling where I can. I'm not, you know, I'm not setting it to the lowest possible price that I want to go. I think I've set mine to, you know, maybe 25% off of where maybe I would have sold them at kind of the height. So they're there to be purchased if, if they want to be. But I am kind of waiting, like, once I start to see those start to pick up a little bit, then I take some off just to see where the market goes from there. But, yeah, it's, it's tricky. It's a tricky thing. It's not like crypto, because you can't just liquidate everything. Right."
    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "It's a very difficult thing to do, actually. I mean, it's the whole non fungibility of this. Right. It's, it isn't as liquid. And, you know, what I've noticed is the opensea emails have dried up a little on a lot of these projects. And there's also, you know, I would say panic. The floor undercutting happens, and then eventually the floor gets to a spot where a good project's going to get bought up and people are going to entertain and bad projects are going to slide, and there may not be any comeback from those. And so I think to both your points, is going forward selectivity and getting into putting holdings. Like, if you're going to hold, like, the blue chip, top tier stuff is where you need to be. And I also think the biggest thing that you could be learning right now, if you're new ish, is take profit. Right? Like, you need to be somewhat liquid to kind of keep going in this. In this game, like the. If you're flipping or whatever. So. But you, like, I'm. I was sitting here about a week and a half ago with just like, all these paper gains that are not realized in ETH in my wallet, right."

So anytime I feel the need to show my wife how much money we potentially have, I try to sell 25% at that point because it's hundred percent going to be a correction. It's every time. Every time there's a correction, whether it's crypto, nft, doesn't matter. I'm like, oh, look, I just sold this cat for this much money like this. You know, it's crazy or I don't know what it was, but it was. It was definitely something. And then I showed her the WGMI, and I was like, you know, I got to sell some of this stuff."

And there was that, you know, exploit of the contract where somebody minted a thousand of them and you were only supposed to be able to do one per transaction, all of that. But what I think is crazy about this, so that, that doesn't surprise me from, like, the 24 hours or, sorry, the seven day volume. But look at the 24 hours volume. 83% up, and it's, you know, 400. So 83% up in the last 24 hours, which is kind of weird. Is that guy, like, sold out and are we bouncing on that, like, floor of what? Point 73, it says here. I don't know. What were your thoughts on the sevens? Obviously not a project I'm interested in buying, even at this point, for those reasons. But it looks like somebody is in there buying."

Dropped down to, like, 0.4 something. Now it's back up to seven. So it feels like things are maybe, I don't know, recorrecting. It's kind of interesting."

But, like, where. How many listings were down there? Right. Like, is the floor there? Because there's 200 listings at 0.2, or is it five?

In crypto terms or charting terms like these support and resistance levels for these, for this kind of price action that you're seeing. Right.

And I was like, oh, could you grab me one? And he was nice enough to do so. And I missed the entire run up, like it was going crazy, and it was over. It, like hit two e and bounced all the way back down, like 0.8. And so I kind of panicked and put mine for sale at like 1.2 or 1.25, and then it just went nuclear from there. It was insane. Ran all the way up to 17 eth and, and now. And now it's all the way back down to 6.75 is the floor.

You know, earlier you guys were talking about kind of over saturation in the market and like the bear market and stuff. And I think it's because there's just too many projects that are coming out that are kind of offering the same thing. And when we launch, or rather when captain launched this fantasy football league as part of the digital network, we have all these, you know, we have 16 different communities, we have all these great communities involved. I sat here and thought, you know, why wouldn't we basically make a trading card token that represents the league and use all of those proceeds to buy up the floors of all the different league members, give them out as prizes every week. People can follow along in the league. It's basically like a new kind of derivative or form of fantasy football. We have our representatives or 16 captains of the different projects that drafted these teams. So now people that are out in those communities, out in those discords of those projects, they can follow along through either owning an NFT token for that team or they can buy, sell, trade, pick up other ones, see which teams they think are going to be performing the best, scoop those up and have chances at great prizes. So like a high level. But really the way that it works is we'll be launching 7216 nfts. So there's 451 nfts per team. So there's 16 teams."

So Des and money Mac are involved in this league, too, which makes it super fun to have some actual, you know, NFL representation in this fantasy league. So those are all the teams? Yeah, those are all the teams that are in this. So there's 16 teams, all represented by either, you know, founders of the community or big, you know, community members or community managers who have all drafted teams. And then based on that, this idea is giving all of the communities or anybody who wants to get involved an actual stake in like, the performance of the league from week to week.

Within each card we have six different positions. So we have head coach quarterback on down to flex. Each of those positions provide a different rarity. So you'll have a different amount of entries into our weekly prizes, giveaways that we do. So the total mint proceeds, well, 97% of the total mint proceeds are, is 490 ETH. We're taking all 490 ETH and we're going to be buying up nfts from all of the projects that participate in our league. So if you divide that out by 15 weeks of the season, we're looking at about 24 and a half, 25 ETH a week. Week to be buying up these projects, which is just freaking nuts. So, you know, some weeks you might be giving away like 100 and 5200 unraced dead horses you know, some weeks we might be giving away a few gutter cats or mutant apes.

So what is really cool, I think if you are one of these community members that's represented here by your team, uh, we're going to be buying up floors, right? So, like, all of these projects, you know, are going to be seeing some, some benefit here from just being in the league. So for, as a project, it's really cool. Um, because, you know, one, you're represented with all these other communities, there's going to be cool crossover trash talking all that with just in the fantasy league, but then, you know, we're going to be spending 24, 25 eth a week on, you know, going to buy 100 goats or, you know, like you said, 100 Zed horses and.

You can burn that card and the first 1400 will get the mint cost back of 0.07. What I love about this concept is that say, like, my team as an example, I was one of the lower draft grades.

Maybe I'm scooping up the higher rarity ones of certain teams I like more than others. Because you see this QB card here on this infographic, right? You see how it's in like the PSA slab here. Yeah. So these are, these are rarer versions. These are rarer versions of the card. Right. So the QB card has a rare, is a high rarity in and of itself.

So point being, right, if you're playing the long game here and you want the most chances to win the board ape, it could behoove you to have a, you know, a slabbed card of the quarterback. Right. Though, because those will be super valuable. You'll have ten chances to win, you know, if you're holding the championship team there other thing too is there the head coach card works as almost like a wild card. So if you hold one of. There's only 16. If you hold one of the 16 head coach cards, you are in every drawing all the time, no matter what. Right. So that is your kind of trump card. There's only 16 of them. They will be very rare to get. But the reward for having one will be that you are, you have a very high, I would say, positive expected value here on what these giveaways are. Right. So that's another cool nuance here. But this is an example of what we're looking at for like a spotlight matchup. So PC, walk us through kind of week three here."

        "text": "Yeah. So week three is we're kicking off with the bang with bored apes and arsop. We decided to go with mutant apes just because we're giving away a board ape for the grand prize. And with 25 ETH budget, we want to have multiple prize. We can't buy one board ape, so we're buying two mutant apes. That's going to be the high scoring prize. And we're going to be getting 71 Arsop Royal Society cards pretty much each week. How this works is that, like, the home team will be the spotlighted prize that we're buying and the away team will be the high scoring prize that we're buying. That might change if a team is represented twice. We'll kind of flip them. But. So in week one, that's what we're giving away. And your probability with just one card of winning the spotlight prize for sort of winning a Royal Society of players card is almost 30%, 29.5% probability. By owning just one cardinal mid to zero seven, you hold entire Handsworth. You're looking pretty good. Your ev is positive for sure. And that's just in the first week. So pretty like each week we are changing up. We're gonna. As you go on, like week four, we have 20 g vols. 180 goats. Week 5170, unraced zed horses."

        "speaker": "D",

If we're sick of seeing, you know, 180 of a project for some reason, maybe we go bigger, right? Like, look at week six. We have six board ape kennel clubs and five gutter rats that we're giving away."

And that's kind of what we're looking at here. However, there's going to be other ways to win as well. Right? So, you know, from a, the idea is to give kind of this daily fantasy feel to a year long league amongst all of these communities. Right? And so how do you do that? Right. We can do a lot of stuff here with, like, proph. Like prop challenges. Right? So, okay, now you don't have any cards in the spotlight matchup, and we put out a challenge that says, okay, if you're holding the card of the highest score of the team with the highest scoring wide receiver of the week. Right now you're looking at, okay, let me look at all the wide receivers in the league. Who's got a good matchup in fantasy, who's going to be, you know, scoring high, and maybe you go pick up that card. Right. And those are another way that we can implement prizes here. So a lot of really cool kind of DF's challenge style stuff that we can, you know, incorporate into the game mechanic here. And then, you know, like as you said, there's a really that kind of prevents a little bit too or presents you also with a decision on whether or not to burn my token. Right. Because you may be able to play a prop challenge that way without if you. But you couldn't if you burn it. Right. So lots of other cool, cool things here. What, uh, what did we miss here? PC anything?"

Once you start thinking about it, I think we're gonna find a lot of unique kind of buying, selling strategies that people will be doing. And I think anyone that's played fantasy football, however your team looks in the beginning of your is not what your team looks like at the end of the year. That's almost a guarantee. So chamber, if you start buying up quality, just be careful. You might need some, some intel there as the season goes on because once they're running back wide receivers out and injured, that landscape is going to look a lot different."

You know, if QUALLA's the best team, it might make a lot of sense to just pocket one koala for a while, but once the injuries happen, they might not look as good. So I think everyone will have to be quick on their feet and making TradinG. What's actually one thing we didn't talk about, what's going to be really interesting is we're going to be announcing. So we'll be doing the random DraWing and announcement of the card or the NFT id on Tuesdays, but we're not actually going to provide or transfer over until Wednesday. So from Tuesday to Wednesday, those cards that won might be in the market and, or maybe someone owns a card that is a winner and they want to put market for whatever, you know, say they win a gutter rat and they're like, you know, I don't want a gutter rat. Let me just throw it up at the floor at one five and take the payday. That could be happening. So there's going to be a lot of interesting kind of, again, like strategy going on throughout, throughout the week and season."

If you're a card holder, you're going to want to go into that channel the discord, provide input, you know, give intel on trades, on free agent pickups, all that good stuff. But we'll be posting matchups and scoring the discord. And then our website will also have each team's rosters, how they were drafted, and it will be upkeep live. So anytime you want to go check out a roster for a week, you know, say you like, I don't know, you like Count Ridley on the week or you like MacLaurin and you want to go see what team that players on, you can go head over to our website and scoop up that, that roster."

I mean, it just, I mean, kind of. It's kind of like riot races, right? It's just different. Obviously not like right races, but in the sense that it's completely different than everything else. I love the utility. You guys really thought like this. There's so much, there's so many layers that are impressive to me that play to the degenerate gambler side. Who loves fantasy football? Who loves fantasy sports like the prop side, but also to the NFT collector. So I think it's such a wide net you guys are casting with, you know, like a quality. With quality work.

So somebody asked me earlier and I thought it was a good question, is there any incentive for league owners to tank or lose on purpose? And the answer to that is absolutely not. And here's why. One, you are representing your entire community, so you don't want to let team goats down from a bragging rights perspective. But two, out of the operating budget of what our secondary sales might bring in, we have designated for each 25% of our supply that we sell out, we're putting one eth towards the Mat league managers prize pool. So you'll be playing for a potential four ETH prize pool to incentivize the league managers so that you're making the best decisions for each of these community teams. Right. So the founders are putting that up. It won't come out of the mint. That all goes to the prizes. We're putting that up as incentive for you guys to keep running your league or your team as best you possibly can so that people, you know, can, can really get into this league.
