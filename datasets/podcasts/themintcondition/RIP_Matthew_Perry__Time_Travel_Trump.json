I think they played on the same day. But it was definitely like Seinfeld. Friends were the two big shows to watch back then. And I watched them. I mean, just like any other schmo back then. As I got older, I realized one was significantly better than the other. Obviously, Seinfeld being the better one. And friends was just really unwatchable as I, you know, as I got into my twenties and into my thirties. Just terrible. So I wasn't a fan. The rewatch ability wasn't there. But, I mean, I've seen every episode at least twice, you know what I mean? And my big takeaway from it because, you know, as the passing of Matthew Perry provided a lot of best of clips from friends, and he really represented the nineties, and I forgot how sarcastic the nineties were and how it influenced me a lot. I think a lot of characters from that time were a lot of sarcasm, a lot of flippancy, and I forgot. And I like how we are now. I feel we're a less sarcastic. You know, people in the, in the twenties, I don't know, the tens and the twenties. Did you see much of that in the nineties and early two thousands? Have you seen the transition away from the sarcastic?"

Look, this one, it kind of hit me a little bit of, like, you know, I was saying to my wife this, you know, celebrity deaths in general do not faze me much at all. And if ever, I can't remember many specific examples where I was super upset about a celebrity death. Mostly I feel like I am totally just removed from that. Right. So it, like, it doesn't affect me much. And this one is interesting because. And I feel like part of that, part of why I say that is most of them are much older than me, so they weren't people that I appreciated or grew up with in the same capacity. Right. So, like, my mom, like, cried and watched the entire, like, you know, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson's funerals on the couch and, you know, like, they really affected her. I don't have those same kind of connections or experiences, and those people were not part of my life in a meaningful way. Friends. Because of all the reasons you just described. Right. It was, like, the most popular show on television. It's still syndicated everywhere. It's one of those shows you just always have on reruns and it's just like, it's never gone away. Right. So, like, even though he is kind of out of the spotlight, the show was never. Right. So, like, you have all these moments where that show was part of your life, and then that happens and it's unfortunate, but, like, it makes you reflect on why. Right? Like, this one actually got me a little. Not because I was a huge Matthew Perry fan or anything, but it was just more so, like, oh, our childhood icons are dying now."

It could have not been, but, like, it makes. It's not. It makes more sense. You know what I mean? Like, it's not this crazy freak thing. So it puts it into perspective a little more. I do have a funny story specifically about Matthew Perry, which is when I still worked at Sam Adams back in, gosh, decided to be 2015 or 2016, maybe. We had our national sales meeting in Cancun. One when you take first fun fact, we, as a company, drank more beer in that week that we were down in Mexico than the entire country of Mexico drinks of Sam Adams a year, which can tell you how much fun we had down there."

Why don't we just stay in the room for a couple hours? We'll grab a nap or something. And you're, like, bunked up with somebody. So me and my buddy Tim, who I was staying with for the week, we're just, like, laying in bed, separate beds, but we've got the tv going on and friends is on, and we're like, all right, this is good. Should we see what else is on? And so we switched the channel, and friends is on that channel, and we switched the channel, and Matthew Perry's on a talk show, and we switched the channel again, and it's one of his other shows that he had done after friends. And we're like, what the fuck is happening? Is Matthew Perry Mexico's national treasure? Like, it sure seemed like that. And so we thought, you know, we must have flipped, I don't know, ten or 20 channels, and he was on, like, half of them in some capacity. And so we're like, oh, okay. Well, Matthew Perry is very famous here in Mexico. And so we just started referring to him for the rest of our friendship as Signor Perry. And so I texted my buddy, you know, the other night and was fondly reminded of Signor Perry. And our hearts go out to the entire country of Mexico."

There's an illustration in the book that slightly resembles Barron Trump. That same author wrote another book a few years later called the last president, in which a strongly opposed New York politician surprisingly gets elected as president, and the people protest in a state of uproar. That politician in that book lived in a New York City apartment on Fifth Avenue, the same avenue in which Trump Tower resides. Now."

So if you hear something that seems weird or there's a conspiracy theory, I always research Snopes, and they've done a lot of digging into the validity of a lot of fantastic claims. So this is from Snopes. Barron Trump's marvelous underground journey and the last president are both indeed real books written by Ingersoll Lockwood. Quote here, we haven't been able to uncover any evidence proving that Donald Trump and his family have access to a time machine. However, both of the books are archived by the Library of Congress and can be read in full@archive.org. dot Barron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey was published in 1893. The last president was published in 1900. A few years later, according to the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Lockwood penned at least one other book about Barron Trump's, about the Baron Trump character, and that was titled the Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and his wonderful Dog, Bulger, which was published in 1890. So there is a prequel to that particular book. Now, I have seen, and I haven't, you know, I haven't checked the evidence on this, but I've heard of. Are you familiar with the inventor Nikola Tesla? Which, you know, obviously the Tesla cars, right? So, Nikola Tesla was one of the great minds of, you know, humanity, and, you know, discovered all sorts of great inventions that we still use today. But towards the end of his life was really, I don't know what's the best way to put it, shunned by the same people that propped him up. Westinghouse, being one of them, always had big problems with Thomas Edison, who was, you know, of light bulb fame. I don't know if you're familiar with Thomas Edison, so, obviously, we all know Thomas Edison today, but for a long time, the name Nikola Tesla wasn't a household name like it is today. And there is a talk that Westinghouse and Edison kind of put Tesla out the pasture, ruined his reputation, and he died with nothing. But one of Tesla's landlords was actually Donald Trump's grandfather, which is interesting. And there is the through line is, did Tesla have some sort of time machine that was left in his apartment, or maybe some blueprints, for one? And that's how this was all was able to be done. Um, what are your thoughts there?"
