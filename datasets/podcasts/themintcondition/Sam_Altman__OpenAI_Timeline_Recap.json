And then Friday afternoon it comes out that the board has decided that they are removing Sam from CEO and that he will no longer be working at Openaiden. Internet just exploded like it was wild.

So, like they didn't even know. And because I'll tell you right now, if they did know, they wouldn't have done it before closing on Friday in terms of like, having this stock impact. Right. So they. That caught them off guard and everything. And so then it starts to, like, the wild accusations start coming, like, because you can't imagine how this happens without it being something just insanely catastrophic or in the wrong from Altman or whatever. Like what was hiding all this stuff. So all the rumors started flying. There was some rumors that were from, you know, months ago about some potential, like, sexual allegations. There were, yeah, but, like, those don't make sense for being the reason because it's been out there for months. Right. So, like, to be so abrupt last week doesn't make so, like, that one I kind of immediately ruled out. But then there was, you know, how is he doing something weird with the financials or all this stuff. But OpenAI, when they did this, they came out with the statement, and the statement was like, full on, like, attack almost. I mean, it was very, it was not the typical, oh, we've, you know, we're very thankful to have had Sam and, you know, parting on our separate ways, blah, blah, blah.

Like, did they discover AGI and somebody on the board gets spooked and decide that this couldn't be out in the wild and all this stuff? So that was, like, Friday, and by Saturday morning, you have now Satya Nadella, who is the CEO of Microsoft, stepping in to, like, mediate this process. But in the meantime, OpenAI named a new interim CEO, which was, I forget her last name, her first name. Murray. M u R. Yeah, she was on the board. Well, just wait. Oh, just wait. Because they. So the board consists of, like, I think it was two gentlemen. One was this Ilya Sutzkiber, and then somebody else. I forget. And then there was two, two women on the board as well. And they named this woman the new interim CEO, but apparently didn't even tell her the full story. And so she's the new CEO for the time being. It comes out that, like, Microsoft is in full on mediation, negotiation, all of this stuff. And by the end of, like, Saturday. By the end of Saturday, it was Sam and Greg Brock. Oh, so Greg Brockman is the guy that you were talking about before who resigned with Sam. He's one of the co founders of OpenAI.

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Correct. So, like, the only way it would have or could have been that is like, was there some, uh, you know, private investigation that was going on and it came back proven true and, and, you know, all of that. But like, again, I don't think it was that, but it could, it could have been. But, um, you would think the rest of the story wouldn't have unfolded this way if that was the case. Right. So, so now you're at Saturday, they get offers from Microsoft and they're actually like going to work at Microsoft now to lead and be the CEO of this new AI research division, blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, all this is happening. And like all the, like, I've never seen a rally of employees do this, but basically Microsoft said any OpenAI employee has an open offer from Microsoft if they want to leave and that there would be jobs waiting for them. All of this stuff, really what I think was happening is the leading narrative, I think is OpenAI, don't forget, started as a nonprofit with the mission of, you know, creating AGI for the good of humanity. Right. And what it has become is obviously this massive entity that it now has a pretty large for profit arm. Right, for. With chat, GBt and GPT plus and all that. And to me it feels like there was a friction point. And the reason I brought up the dev day earlier was the rumor is, like, dev Day was a step too far and the board wasn't aware of the GPT store and launching all of this stuff. And so that was the story. That kind of one makes sense to me a little bit for a couple reasons. There's this other guy on the board, his name is Anthony D'Angelo or something. He's an actual Anthony."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It's amazing. Anthony D'anthony?"

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I think we reported on it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Back in the day, maybe, probably, but. So Poe's like this app, and it's almost like this aggregator of all these little AI apps, different LLMs people can build kind of these custom chat bots, very similar to what GPTs were. And so part of the theory was like, oh, this guy got pissed because it just obliterated his product."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "For the record, I just looked up Anthony D'Angelo on Twitter and got Tony D'Angelo, 6ft tall, green eyes, horny af. It is not. This is not."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, that's the guy. That's the guy."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "He's in construction and. Yeah, has a hammer."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "That's the guy. Same guy. All right, Tony D'Angelo. Yeah. Anyway, so I don't know if that ends up being the real case. I don't think it is, because turns out, like, this guy's staying on the board after all of it. Right? So, like, I don't think that maybe would have been it, but that was the initial thought. But I do think there's credence to, like, this profit nonprofit thing, because part of what this means is, like, first of all, like, once you saw between Dev Day and the time you got fired, chat GPT saw a super increase in users. And they actually. So the quality was actually kind of degrading. It was going down a decent amount and just wasn't working like it normally did. And so the resources were clearly being strained a little bit, to the point where they actually had to. They've. It's still like this today, so it's been a couple weeks. They actually suspended signups. You cannot go buy a chat GPT plus account right now if you wanted to. They suspended signups because they couldn't take any more users with the resources. So actually you could go buy a chat GPT plus account on eBay. Really? Yeah, absolutely. So anyway, so this stuff's happening. And so when you think about, like, what the implications of that are versus, like, the nonprofit arm, which is really dedicated to resource or, sorry, research, you realize that, oh, there is a push and pull in the company of, like, where these resources should be allocated in terms of GPU's and compute. Right? Because it's limited. You only have so much compute power in the company. You can't just go buy more GPU's right now. There's this big GPU squeeze from Nvidia, which is basically the only people that make the GPU's that actually can run all these models, et cetera, et cetera. And so if you don't have them, you are forced to ration between one and the other. And so there's always. So the Zen theory became like, oh, people felt that it was being too commercialized and was not against the initial mission. And that's why he initially got voted out. Right. That, I think is probably the best theory. But so this is how wild the story is. And it all happened since Friday. So they fire him. We've got the new interim CEO. We've got them going to work for Microsoft. And then you've got this open invite for all employees to go work at Microsoft. And then all of a sudden it's like, well, we're actually, so this Ilya Sudskyver guy, the one with the bad hair, tweets on Monday morning, I think it is that he deeply regrets participating in this decision. And like, so now the tides are kind of swinging back a little bit. And now it comes out that they're trying to bring Sam back. And this is actually Sunday that this is happening. So apparently the new CEO, like I said, she wasn't totally aware that this was going to happen. She ends up being on team Sam and is kind of trying to get him back at OpenAI. And now Satya and Adela is, like, mediating this entire discussion between OpenAI, Altman, all of this stuff. And so this is what's happening on Sunday. They initially did decide, hey, Sam will go back if you replace all of the board. And the board is replaced with, you know, X, Y and Z people, yada, yada. They gave them a 12:00 p.m. eastern or, sorry, 12:00 p.m. pacific deadline on Sunday to kind of, you know, make a decision. The board, in theory, agrees at the time and then goes totally silent and says they need till 05:00 p.m. pacific. And so now they're totally silent and the clock is ticking. Everybody's looking around like, what's going on? 05:00 p.m. passes. And turns out during that time, they removed the interim CEO and hired a new CEO from outside the company. Guy's name is Emmett Shear, I believe, and he was actually the co founder of Twitch. And if you look at this guy's history talking about AI, he's, he's not, I wouldn't call him like a doomer, as in, like he thinks, you know, AI is going to be the end of society as you know it, but he's, but he's not, not that, right. He's much more conservative in terms of how he wants to approach the speed of AI development. All this stuff. He's on record with tweets saying it's going at a ten right now. I would slow it down to a two, which again, kind of supports the theory that it was more about this consumerism of it versus research and safety. Now you got this guy coming in as the CEO and the woman is out. And so this is all happening on Sunday, and it's just a total shit show. And so they finally. Then on Monday, Ilya tweets that he deeply regrets it all. The employees start tweeting out. OpenAI is nothing without its people. And there's like this big, long Twitter chain that goes on. It's like when you see a bunch of apes, quote, quote, tweeting each other, you know, that's kind of what this was like. And so this is all going on. And then you get this kind of, you get this news that the new CEO basically asks for written documentation of, like, why Sam was removed. And then he says, like, if you can't provide me that, I'm a, I will not be CEO. And nobody could provide anything of the sort. And so this whole thing turns into, you know, another shit show where still uncertain. Then Satya and Sam come out and say that they're talking about him rejoining OpenAI. Sam tweets this picture of him wearing a OpenAI lanyard that says guesthouse. And it says, you know, first and last time I'll ever wear one of these. And, you know, so it's kind of cryptic, of like, is he coming back or is he just gonna say f you after this or whatever? But he was. I feel like he took the highest of high roads almost the whole time. But it turns out in the middle of the night last night, which I pinned to the top, this was 15 hours ago, it says, we've reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as the CEO with a new initial board of Brett Taylor, Larry Summers, Adam D'Angelo. Sorry, it's Adam."

And, um, you know, I guess no harm, no foul. We'll see. But, but we still no we still don't officially know. Um, but I think you can kind of. Oh, so again. And so then they replaced those initial board members, which this Adam D'Angelo guy was on the board initially. He's not replaced, which tells me that Poe thing is probably not correct. Right? So, but the people who were, were the two women on the board. One of them was. One of them was some actor's wife. And I don't really know what her credentials were outside of that. The other one is. Was a researcher and big into like, the AI safety stuff and all of that. So the theory is, oh, by the way, my wife just walked in and handed me the irig."

        "text": "Is that what we're saying? Yoko AI was what they actually intended to rename it. But I mean, this is probably the best case scenario, right? Like, there was a lot of up in the air things over the weekend where like, all right, well, what's the scenario if they go to Microsoft because of the partnership, it's like, okay, what do they have access to? Do they have access to model weights? Can they just kind of use and build on what already exists? Do they have to go build their own and train something themselves? All of this stuff? And now what you have instead is these guys back at OpenAI with what will seem like kind of this renewed focus. Because now everybody in theory, is bought into Sam's vision, right? They brought them back. They're all tweeting in solidarity. Like, it's probably all systems go now, and you're probably going to see them, like, build and ship crazy shit in the next because you gotta think, like, whatever was the friction point is now gone, right? So I don't know. I think the story ends as well as it could for Sam Altman and probably the. Probably the world, I think. I don't know, the. It also came out that, like, this, the woman that was removed from the board wrote this big long essay or whatever, kind of describing what was wrong. And she said somewhere in there, I don't know, exact detail, basically, that the decision to potentially blow up open AI was what was best for humanity. And like, oh, well, that's, that's quite the statement, right? So, like, what, what could the reason have been? Maybe it is this AGI stuff and it's happening just way faster than, you know, people are comfortable. Some people were comfortable with, but you don't really know. We'll see. But, I mean, he did kind of on the dev day, he said, um, you know, I hope you come back next year, because what we just announced today is going to look quaint, comparatively, which really, which is also quite the statement. Right. So, you know, and there's also been these things in the past where, like, a couple weeks or a month ago or so on Reddit, he posted something that said, like, AGI has been achieved internally. So, like, there's all these rumors going around, like, what the actual thing is. But that's the TLDR 40 minutes version of TLDR on all of the OpenAI saga. What say you?"

If it happened where they ended up at, Microsoft ended up having to kind of like retrain models and things like that, there's a huge time gap that happens. And if OpenAI was then leaning towards, okay, back to research, well, that means your chat is probably going to not be supported as hard. Your APIs might be not supported or degraded or things like that. And the products that we've been building on or using would probably suffer greatly.
