And it makes me want to bring up this tweet I saw from our old buddy cred today. Uh, and so I think, you know, as you mentioned, like, keep your number and your target in mind. I would also say, think about this tweet. I really liked it today. Think about this tweet heavily. Decide which camp you're in and be okay with your outcome. Knowing you, you stuck to one of these. These things, right? And so, cred, one of the best traders, I would say, out there, he's been around since 2017 ish as well. Bull market regrets take two main forms. One, not betting enough to not keeping enough to fix. One, you size up and bet more, including more overall portfolio leverage, less liquid bets, and holding through unreasonable price moves and valuations. The cost is higher portfolio volatility, higher risk of ruin, and a likely significant haircut of your portfolio all time high. If done well, you make a lot more, but keep less. I would say that's what I fell into last cycle. That was me last cycle. My all time high was wild. What I ended up keeping out of that made me sad. Like, you know, but this was, and I can't say that I was purposely doing this. I was doing this unconsciously in terms of, like, I don't think I had a plan. Right. And so, but I would say I fell into this bucket number to fix number two, which is not keeping enough. You take profit on the way up, generally become more conservative the longer the trend continues, fewer illiquid bets, less leverage, more taking profit and trade management. The cost is less upside and potentially wasting a cycle of opportunities. If done well, you make a lot less but keep a lot more. Crucially, you're unlikely to fix both at the same time. Thick. Pick your poison. I think that's a very important message at the end. Would you say that's accurate?"

The video specifically I was watching, it made so much sense to me that it's like, holy shit, I can't believe everyone is not doing this.

And I thought was really interesting and the common thing you hear of, oh, why people don't want to buy bitcoin versus a stock is like, well, it has no cash flows. It's just this greater fool theory. It's a Ponzi blah blah blah. And he's making the argument in this video of, yeah, cash flow is actually a bad thing in terms of how do you value a stock? Because he's like, that has to happen for a company year over year over year over year and it becomes impossible over time to beat what you did last time in terms of cash flow and earnings and dividends and all of these strategies that these companies use to boost their stock prices. And hes like, you dont have to worry about that shit with bitcoin. He goes, bitcoins property and if it becomes 100 times the price it is now, its 100 times more valuable. Simple as that. And im like, oh, okay, this makes a lot of sense. And the line he says at the end is like, so mind blowing to me, because I talk about this. I use this phrase a lot. Digital transformation. He calls bitcoin the digital transformation of capital. And I thought that was, like, very mind blowing to me. And so I'm orange pilled from Saylor again.

Nobody's ever viewed your gifs and laughed or gotten upset or anything else. They have one reaction. I have received a reply from someone between 38 and 54 years old. And then there was, like, something, like, in the comments. There was something in the comments, basically along the lines of, yeah, the worst is when you see that person and you go to their, like, replies or their media or tab or whatever, and it's just the same reaction jif on every post they have. I was like, oh, my God, that's fucking me. Oh, man. I was. I was shook on this one. What do you think?"

That will give me more, you know, I'll appreciate you a little bit more if you're using the right gif. So this is offensive to me. I don't know what the kids are doing. So what are they.
