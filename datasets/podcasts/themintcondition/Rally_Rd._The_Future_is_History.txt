Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by.
Speaker B: Degen Network, the only community based web three media network, bringing you the very.
Speaker A: Best content in the NFT and cryptocurrency space. Please visit dgen.net work and check out our other great shows. That's Degen dgen.net work. Welcome to the future.
Speaker C: Today on the mint condition, we are joined by Rob Petrozo from Rally Road, talking all things collectibles, NFT, and the future is history. Drop. Let's go. Hello and welcome to the mint condition. I am bunchu, alongside my esteemed colleague and co host, Chamber. Chamber. How you doing, buddy?
Speaker B: I'm doing pretty good, man. Mike check, I think.
Speaker C: Check.
Speaker B: Holy shit. Was I mad last week.
Speaker C: Please explain to the people what happened.
Speaker B: So, you know, we're pretty technical guys here, so I have multiple options for microphones, you know, in my whole setup here. So I don't know what happened, but something got reset where I was pulling a different camera. So before yesterday's show, I fixed that. And for whatever reason, my own stupidity, I forgot to check if the microphone was set up properly. And if, you know, if you're. I don't hear my own voice, you know, during this, you know, through my. Through my speakers, but, you know, I'm talking away. We're having a. We have a great show, I think a phenomenal show. I would say like an a, if not a plus show last week. And we finish up, I go outside. I have my post show cigarettes my backyard. I immediately, because, you know, I'm a psychopath. I immediately go back and listen to the show on YouTube, and I noticed that the audio is not coming from this beautiful, beautiful, sure, you know, professional podcaster microphone. It's coming from my webcam, and the audio just sounds absolutely terrible. And I'm a really. I'm a big stickler for the quality of our audio, especially on the podcast side. And I was so mad. Like, it ruined at least 48 hours of my week last week, and I deleted it. I didn't put it out as a podcast. I actually, which made me feel a little bit better, actually put out.
Speaker C: It's pretty aggressive. You were like, absolutely not. No interest whatsoever. No, I thought we should have put it out anyway, but you were just.
Speaker B: Our listeners deserve better than that. And. Yeah, so I actually sat down and put out a little apology pod for the listeners, so hopefully they got a little laugh about that.
Speaker C: I think we should just do that every week. It's just, you apologize. It's just one pod for two minutes, and you apologize for something new each week.
Speaker B: We got a ton of listens on it.
Speaker C: We did.
Speaker B: It was like one of our best episodes.
Speaker C: Highly rated. Two. Hey, look, I think we should just start doing that. You should just apologize for something new each week and we'll go from there and that's it. But yeah, so you've got the proper bike going on. I'm apologizing today. It's my turn to apologize because as you can see, I'm in a new location. If you're watching at home, this is my new office. We finally finished it and I am, I have no furniture in here yet, so there's no furniture. And it sounds that way. So we are rolling with this. I promise I'll get some things on the walls to absorb some sound and. But you'll have to deal with me today. And that's gonna, it still sounds like.
Speaker B: Ten times better than my audio sounded.
Speaker C: All right, well, there we go. But before we get started and get into it today, just a reminder to like and subscribe here we have the DjEn Network newsletter that goes out once a week. Make sure you're signing up for that. We have all great kinds of articles, including my favorite article from this week so far was the boots, boots Thanksgiving family article, chamber did you.
Speaker B: Amazing. I did like that one very.
Speaker C: Check that out@djen.net. work. Listen to all of our family of shows. We have some amazing shows going on right now. We've got coffee with captain every morning at eight on Twitter spaces. Then the NFT night shift twice a week, Mondays and Fridays, alpha afternoons, beloved jouelzy and the airdrop sports report on Tuesdays on Twitter. So we've got a ton of awesome content for you. And starting next week, Chamber, we're adding to the, we're adding to the mix. Big news. Tell the people what, what we're doing.
Speaker B: So with all the kids on Twitter these days, you know, Elon has resurrected the app as a whole. Everybody wants to be on spaces. So we're actually going to put out a Monday space. Monday. 04:00 hop on Twitter. You guys can, we're going to pull people up. It's going to be great. It's going to be very different than this show.
Speaker C: I'm really nervous about it, actually, because I am no Steve when it comes to hosting Twitter spaces. So we'll see how that goes.
Speaker B: I'm not bring Steve on to reset the room if we need.
Speaker C: Yeah, right. Exactly. We need that. But yeah, super pumped about that. I hope it'll be more casual. We were looking for names for this Twitter space today and throwing some stuff out in the, and I suggested the mint condition Monday edition and I think that was it.
Speaker B: Like, I never said it out loud. It, I just looked at it and it looked kind of boring.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: When you say it, when you say it, it's way better. I know. Thank you.
Speaker C: That is good.
Speaker B: That is, that is the winner.
Speaker C: That's the winner. But we have an amazing guest today. We're going to bring him in right now. We're getting right to it. We've got Rob Petrozo, the CEO and, sorry, chief product officer and co founder of Rally, with 15 years experience as a digital designer. Experience lead creative director and product specialist. He's worked with a broad spectrum of content in a variety of industries, including music, publishing and biotechnology. Joining us here to talk rally collectibles and the future is now drop this week. Rob, thanks for joining us, man.
Speaker A: Yeah, I thought I got a promotion as CEO. For a second I was excited. I don't know. Thank you for having me. You guys have a million things going on, too, so thank you for making time and appreciate it.
Speaker C: Absolutely. We're, I'm super psyched for this conversation. One, because, you know, I personally have been a rally user for, for quite some time because before, before I got into the NFT space, I was big into physical collectibles, sports cards, memorabilia, all that kind of stuff. And when you guys really kind of started the wave of this like fractionalized assets and, you know, there's, you guys, there's collectible. And I was dabbling in, I was dabbling in all of them because it was just such a cool thing to, you know, you start collecting and you want these grails, these grail pieces, right? And they're very unattainable for a, you know, a lay person like me. So a simple podcaster. So, but you could, but through that, you know, securitization and fractionalization, you can get your hands on some really cool stuff in a portfolio and you can kind of live trade them back and forth. And it's, it's no surprise that like, you know, graduate from that into digital collectibles. And we're going to talk all about that today. So I'm super pumped to have you. I guess. Let's get started with your background. So it's funny, I came from a background of like corporate sales and I always tell this story of like, before I got into web three full time, I was selling adult diapers to nursing homes. And now I get to like, do stuff with collectibles all day. So how did you get from where, you know, growing up to working in the collectible space? Starting rally.
Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, listen, your journey is not that different than mine. I didn't have as many adult diapers to deal with as you probably did, but to keep it real. Like, everybody, you know this. Like, everybody's a collector of something. Like, everybody nerds out on something. And it starts when you're super young, and there's always that nostalgia that goes with it. I think for me, when I got out of school, it was like, mid two thousands call it. And, you know, like, technology didn't exist the way it does right now. So if you want to find a job or do something cool, you either have to just start, like, working and putting out, like, for me as a designer, put out as much of work as possible, or you had to go that corporate structure and, like, find a friend at a company who let you intern there or, like, figure out a way in. So when I got out of school, I was doing, like, as much freelance design as possible. I put up, like, a nonsense website that looked crazy. And everybody around that time was, like, self taught with HTML and, like, making little programs or whatever. So I had this garbage website. I had, like, three or four clients that I picked up that happened to be, like, in music in some capacity. And by chance, one of Kanye west managers saw a thing that I did. Like, a design I did for a flyer that was at a print place in Queens and my numbers on the back of it, and he called me and was like, yo, we have this kid, Kanye west. We're starting this label. This is 2004. He was like, we need designers. You want to come in and do some work? And I was like, I knew who Kanye was at that point. The album wasn't out yet, but he's like, come in. So I went in there. They had this office in the Sony building, like, tucked all the way in the back of the 17th floor. It was like a little bullshit mini startup with, like, a bunch of interns. And then I just, like, started hanging out and getting work, and that kind of led to, like, new conversations. Then Kanye took off, so it was way easier to have any other conversation with anybody else in the space. They wanted that same kind of magic. They thought anybody around it could provide it. I absolutely could not provide that magic, but I will absolutely take the check and do some new designs for you. So that led to, like, you know, all of a sudden, startups took over New York, met a bunch of people working on cool stuff. And eventually every graphic designer turned into like a UX and UI designer. All of them turned into product designers. Every product designer now found their way into web three, one way or another. And collectibles along the way were always a part of that because you meet all these people and you're learning all this new stuff, you want to have, like, these physical things that go along with it. And that was like the real trajectory of the business. And then myself, my co founders, Max and Chris, we've known each other forever. We knew that finance would play a part in that. At some point, like 2014, 2015, we sat down and it was like, do you want to quit our jobs and figure out a way to do what Robinhood started to do and a few others with retail investing and bring it to the things that we actually care about? And then that led to rally in like, 2016.
Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny. I mean, the, just the thought of the trajectory of like, this alternate asset class that you have with these collectibles. It's funny because, like, you really facilitated a whole new industry because before there was no liquidity in this stuff, right. And people collected it because they loved it and, but what you guys really were able to do is bring liquidity and a market to that where you could actually do this as, as a actual investment and really treat it as such. Before, it was really just, you know, collecting nostalgia and it was, it would have been a ton of, you know, work to actually do this as a investment and build a portfolio around it. And, you know, what you guys have done really facilitated that. And I think where we're seeing kind of move this into web three terms, it's, it's only going to get easier to facilitate these kind of things. And so just kudos to you guys for kind of seeing the future there and building something really cool. And I'm super pumped to see how you guys take a web three approach as it keeps building here.
Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate it, man.
Speaker C: Yeah. So talk a little bit about your beginnings here. Like, where did the, I guess, idea come from? The, like, how did the fractionalization of assets where you started come into and evolve into what you're doing now in web three and the initiatives you're taking there.
Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, you hit it, you hit a little bit on the head in that, in the thoughts that you just put out where it's, everybody collects something, but this is the web three problem, too. And this is like what happened with nfts at rally and with everybody that works at rally too. Inevitably, you buy garbage the first time that you, like, spend money on any collectible or anything. You always buy something where it's, like, something you like and you see it, but you're kind of chasing a little bit. So the impetus is always to, like, accidentally make a mistake the first time, which is natural. Everybody should do that. Hopefully, it's a cheap mistake. You don't get hit over the head with it later.
Speaker C: Wishing, yeah, seriously.
Speaker A: And, I mean, I've made many expensive mistakes, so. But that said, we always knew there would be a world where, like, the museum quality stuff starts to get way more interesting to you. The blue chip stuff starts to get way more interesting to you once you start going down that pathway. So buying that first, like, bad thing, for me, it was. It was with comic books and cards. Early on, I bought, I thought there were two or three cards and comic books like this. This issue of Superman where he dies, and it was in, like, this black vinyl, and it was like this, this $7 comic book I thought was going to legit pay for a house. At a certain point, me and my friend chipped in and got two. We opened one to get the armband that came with it, kept the other one sealed. Like, this is it, guys. We just made the best decision of our lives. Then you, then it turns out they made 17 million of them. You're not gonna make any money on it. You know what I mean? But then you start thinking like, all right, there's obviously something to comic books. People care about it. There are these massive franchises. It lives forever. It's generational. It's always gonna be relevant. The best examples of Superman number one and some of the earliest, earliest books of the highest grades, they're in the hands of, like, seven or eight people, and they're tucked away and no one ever sees them. So for us, it was like, we want to have those two worlds. There should be that tactile, tangible thing. I own it. It's the one that I care about. Maybe it's one that's not graded or it's a lower grade or it's not the exact one, and it's a reprint, but you have that kind of connection with owning and holding something. But then there's a portfolio piece where we always thought that this idea that you live in your passions and you invest in your passions should be something that translates to more than just a ticker symbol. So when we sat down with, like, our lawyers and started thinking about what this was going to be as a platform, it was explaining that to everybody, whether it was an investor, a new hire, family and friends, like, listen, I understand the things that you love. You want to have and you want to see it. You want to have that in your, whether it's in a metamask wall or it's sitting on a shelf behind you, you want to own it. But there's this other stuff that a lot of people have made a lot of money on for a long time that I'm confident we can get access to with the community of people and make it the portfolio worthy, museum worthy piece. And that was kind of where everybody kind of understood a little bit better when we described that you can still have the things that you love and hold them and have the tactile, tangible piece. But there's these crazy examples that have been going up into the right for a long time. Those should be in any portfolio, not just stocks, not just crypto. It should be alternative assets too. And that's where we kind of pitch rally as the opportunity for that third lane that wasn't going to be the other two chamber.
Speaker C: You ever dabbled in anything like this?
Speaker B: I've been thinking about it. Obviously you, you know, obviously knowing you for so long have, you know, kind of tickled my curiosity when it comes to these collectibles. But I guess at the end of the day, I think really the only thing I collect now, I got used to collect comic books when I was a kid, hockey, cars when I was a kid. But definitely now is, is basically just albums, records, you know, that's, I have a good amount. I probably have 400, 5500 of them now, you know, and I mean, I do have some, you know, some choice pieces in there, but I'm not the, you know, I'm not going out looking for super rare stuff. I got a couple of first presses from, you know, from Bob Dylan. I got a first pre, I got a first press thriller. It's kind of a cool one. It's. Quincy Jones is the only executive producer on it. I think three. Yeah, that's a good one. So like, I think three months after thriller was released, Michael Jackson was put as executive producer along with Quincy Jones. So I have a Quincy Jones only. So, yeah, just like a cup. Nothing too crazy. Like once. You definitely have like a better assortment of collectibles.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. You just said nothing crazy, but you deserve super crazy, like way you described that. You obviously care because like vinyl is a thing and it is such a specific, like, you trigger these moments and, you know, it's the first edition because of x, y, and z, you just.
Speaker C: The word first press. Right, exactly. Just first press is a term I didn't even know. And so that's totally true. But it's funny you. You even said it, uh, in Rob when you were just talking about, like, having something that you care about that you hold. But it's important to you, even though it may not be the best version of it. Like, for me, one of the coolest things I own is a 1979 Wayne Gretzky rookie card. It's a PSA six, right?
Speaker A: The tops one or the op?
Speaker C: It's the tops one, because, again, I'm just a lowly podcaster.
Speaker A: Yeah, you're playing that role. Well, I know you probably got the stash somewhere.
Speaker C: Like, well, the other one. The other cool thing I have is at the beginning of COVID and I'm sure if you were into the card collecting space and comic books and is like, you know, there's all these kind of, like, black market marketplaces that pop up and these illegal Facebook groups that are raffle that basically just. Basically just raffle stuff off illegally. Right. And so, you know, I was in one of these Raz groups, and I was just bored on my couch at, you know, the beginning of COVID and I jumped into for $180. It was like a raffle of a raffle. Of a raffle. It was like a. It was like a mini. Right? Like. And it was like a satellite reception raffle. Yes, exactly. It was. It was a satellite raffle to get into the main raffle. And so. But it was $180, and I won the spot in the main raffle, and there was these guys that had, you know, thousands of dollars invested in this raffle, and I won it. I won it with this one spot for $180. A 1940 Babe Ruth signed baseball. No way. It's one of the, like, it's got to be, since it's the. From 1940, it's probably one of the last ones he ever signed. Right?
Speaker A: You talking about, like, 50, 60 grand.
Speaker C: Probably sitting on it was. It's. Well, it's got multiple signatures on it, so it's definitely worth less. But it's like. But so I literally drove from my house, like, 8 hours to meet, I remember this dude, to meet this dude in a rest stop so I could pick it up. So I could pick it up by hand so he didn't have to ship it. So, like, that was my. That's my pride and joy.
Speaker A: Yo, you just. You just described, by the way, like, the. The added. The benefit and potentially the downfall of the blockchain technology. If this was all on chain, that entire transaction would never happen. You have to go into, like, a creepy little Facebook group, right? The raffle for the raffle. Meet somebody without a name or a face in the middle of a highway. You just described, like, the customer service experience that gets lost if everything went full on chain.
Speaker C: Totally. Right? So, well, before we keep going, then, I. Since we got on the topic, I need to know what youre. Your pride and joy collectible is that you got.
Speaker A: I mean, I'm into, like, super weird ones. I bought, and I'm into, like, especially in New York, like, financial, like, the meltdown of tech and, like, finance and all these things. It's always this moment of intrigue. I bought a. I bought, in a weird auction, a box of stuff from Bernie Madoff's office. And I have, like, all sorts of, like, random forged stocks, stock receipts. I have, like, a bunch of his business cards, weird stuff from his desk. So I do stuff every now and then. I have. Every now and then I'll do, like, a weird purchase like that. We have in our office. We have a Theranos machine.
Speaker C: I was gonna say. I heard you say yesterday morning you had a Theranos machine.
Speaker B: So what is that? What is that? I don't know that.
Speaker A: Is.
Speaker B: It, like, thanos from, like, avengers?
Speaker C: It's, like.
Speaker A: It's, like, similar in that it's, like, very destructive in the way it was.
Speaker C: Put together, in that it's not real.
Speaker A: Yeah. It's almost fictional, but it was a Elizabeth Holmes, so there's a. You should read a book. It's called Bad Blood. There's also a really good documentary. She was this titan of sort of industry and tech cover of Forbes. Very similar to.
Speaker C: She's the SBF of healthcare.
Speaker A: Yeah, she's the first issue of SBs, if you. SBF, if you want to get technical. But she. This huge fraud that was diluting blood samples and was claiming to sort of be able to cure the world and detect cancer early. It was this massive, massive blow up that she just got sentenced to eleven years in jail. But the machines were these things that, like, the centrifuge machines and the testing machines didn't actually do anything. It was faked. And so there were two machines that were about to get shipped right when they closed it down. So I bought one, and. And a friend bought the other one. They were, like, $250 each, really, in the office, anybody that comes in always stops and, like, takes a picture and talks about it. Yeah, so at some point that might wind up our rally.
Speaker B: I'm getting lit up. I'm getting lit up in the chat here. I feel like that's not a. I know. I'm a man who knows things.
Speaker C: Yeah, you are. I'm very surprised you don't know who Elizabeth Holmes is.
Speaker A: Yeah. Nobody could get mad at that, by the way, you know, the exact moment that Michael Jackson was added to the executive producer line of an album that nobody has, nobody could get mad at that.
Speaker C: It's actually, it's a really interesting cab, like, tangent here, but it's very interesting of like, something like that or the Bernie Madoff stuff that you just talked about. It's really interesting to think about what actually makes something collectible or what makes a collectible. Right. And I've been really thinking about this a lot lately. For one, how I kind of am restructuring my NFT strategy, but to like, just maybe in how NFTs will age over time. Right. It's like, so I'd love to hear kind of, especially with things that are so niche, like a Bernie Madoff business card or a Theranos machine. Rob, what do you kind of think makes something collectible?
Speaker A: I mean, we think when we get. When we buy anything or we acquire anything or do any deals at rally for the, for the assets that we offer, there's a couple of sort of check marks that go with it. And whether it's an NFT and it's, you know, a bored ape or any of the digital products that we have or it's, you know, the Triceratops or the Declaration of independence or some of the crazy older stuff on rally, we have to find something that a has returned. So it's shown that it can be a viable asset. But at the same time, one of the biggest pieces is that it's relevant right now, but that it will be relevant in the future. So when there's like, technology or storyline or some sort of like, item that changes trajectory of like, perception or changes the way that people spend money or changes behavior, that to us is always like a huge signal. So we typically wouldn't go into an asset class that's really new, that's months old or a couple months old. But we started doing nfTs. Like, the first NFT that we put on rally was, was a crypto punk, was crypto 9670. And that was during this time where it was just starting to hit. Hit its stride. Floor price had jumped from, like, I remember what ETH was back then, but it jumped from like, the equivalent of 20,000, probably 75,000. And we made that purchase knowing that it was like the rookie card of these things that were about to go, that felt like they were about to go crazy, where the liquidity of the conversation was so active, it made no sense for us to believe that it wouldn't be important in the future. So even when it's a more volatile or riskier or newer asset, that relevant score that we apply to, it means that the majority of people that are in the conversation, in finance or finance adjacent, would know what it is now. We'll know what it is 20 or 30 or 100 years from now. So that's always part of the belief, what we buy and why we get it. And any of these, like, crazy scandals, especially in tech, it kind of has that same feel. It's like they're going to be telling this story of this massive blow up 100 years from now. It's kind of weird and cool and interesting to have a piece of it, knowing that it was a very specific moment in history that shaped a bunch of financial culture for the next ten or 15 or 20 years.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's super interesting. And I think you nailed it. Right. Like, I've been trying to think of personally just doing some thought exercises around, like, is there a formula for collectibles? Right? And it's like, to me, it's a, like time. It's storytelling, it's community and maybe utility when you think of, like, nfts. Right? And then, and I think that's super interesting for, you know, people who are listening now that are into the NFT space and web three. And you see all these new things come out every day. And I think you have to start framing it as what story will either this collection have ten years from now, or what story will, you know, some of these individual pieces have ten years from now. And I think that's a really interesting way to approach this space. And I think you guys are doing an awesome job with that, with, like, identifying that stuff early with the punk and the bored ape. And I just think it's, like, such an easy thing to think about. Right?
Speaker A: We have.
Speaker C: We have choice.
Speaker A: Like, it was, it's, it's. And the examples, like, like, moonbird is a good example. It's something where now, like, doing crazy expensive mints and doing, you know, 10,000 pfps. Like, it's way, way tougher than it was. But now it's also impossible to have, like, a team that's not docs that people believe in, that understand how to raise money. You have these dynamics of like the business elements of the most of the, of the more important projects. So we did, we put moonbirds on rally super early because we were confident in the team behind it. And that the idea that the future, even though it's going to get rocky, was starting to get very volatile at that point, was kind of like the inklings of what was to come in the NFT market. It was pretty clear that that wasn't like, you know, a B's project. It didn't feel, it didn't have that. It had a really high relevance score and to your point, like really high storytelling score where it's not just a discord that's flooded and a bunch of bots talking shit. It was a real team that people respected, that people knew outside of just the NFT space. So we, we believed it would withstand the test of time, even though it was way new, you know?
Speaker C: Yeah, that's interesting. So maybe before we get into what you guys are doing on Friday, we've talked a lot about rally. We've talked a lot about this awesome culture and stuff behind collectibles. Talk a little about how rally actually works. Like what is it, how does it work, how is it legal? Because that's another thing that we always talk about in the NFT space around this topic of fractionalization and things. And it'll be interesting to see how that develops as far as the DeFi version of that. But talk a little bit about those things first. People who are maybe super nfts and didn't know where existed.
Speaker A: Yeah, so I should have started with that. My bad, too. The long, I'll give you the long and short of it. So we're, we're basically the original platform for buying and selling fractional shares of collectibles. So we run our version of ipos basically every week where you can buy actual ownership shares in these museum collectibles. That's everything from where we started with classic cars. We went into baseball cards and sports memorabilia really quickly. Dinosaur fossils again, like the crypto punks, board apes, all that type of stuff that goes with it. Now that that is considered investments, but those are, to your point, all treated as real securities in the eyes of the SEC. So it's all available to anybody in the US around $10 a share. Right now. The way we did that was we leveraged a lot of the same regulation that crowdfunding used early on. It's called reg a plus. It's something that the SEC put out that was really intended to bridge the gap between accredited investors, the super rich and non accredited investors, regular people who don't have millions of dollars but want access to new investments. So we sat with our lawyers, figured out how to do that, and add this secondary market component to it as well. So as an example, like right now, there's a Batman number one comic is a $1.8 million comic book at IPO.
Speaker B: Looking at that right now.
Speaker C: Yeah, right here on the screen, right?
Speaker A: Yeah. That IPO went public at $10 a share. So there's a couple thousand people who own shares in it right now. Like 90 days or so from now, it'll open up for trading via bid, ask. The same way that, like, the stock market works to a certain degree on our marketplace, all through registered, registered broker dealers. So we took any asset, and we can do this with anything. Now, whether it's digital, physical, cash, producing real estate, whatever it is, we found a way to sort of create and turn it into an LLC. That LLC is qualified by the SEC and becomes shares that trade like stock would on our marketplace. So that was, like, the background, the complexity of it's all tucked away. If you get into the app, it's just like a living museum that people can go through and pick and choose what they want to buy and sell and own actual equity in it. But the behind the scenes work that Max and our financial team and our lawyers did was to make us so that pretty quickly, in ten or 15 days, if we target an asset, we feel like that's a collectible that should be on rally. We can get through this process in a really easy, transparent way super quickly and turn it into stock super, super quick.
Speaker C: Wow, you can do that in two weeks?
Speaker A: Yeah, sometimes quicker. I think we've. We're at, like, 4400, 3450 assets right now, and that's 20 different categories inside the app. And it's everything from tangible to intangible. There's, like, ens, domains and nfts, but there's also, like, you know, typical standard, like Mickey Mantle rookie card, the stuff that people would expect to invest. And that's a tangible asset. All of it is in one form. So if you, you know, transparency is key. We are the trusted third party in between. But, you know, the trust, the idea of, like, a trust list system, it only works in my mind when there's trust already established with the community. And these little, like, SBF ish type things, they mess it up a little bit, and they made the conversation way, way different. Not to dunk on it, anymore. Beat it to death because everybody already has. But we've been doing this for like a really long time at this .7 years in. We have a great relationship with all the powers that be when we submit these assets and submit that paperwork. It's kind of one template now where we're just changing the risk factors, the pricing mechanics, the name of it, and adding like a brief description of what the asset is. And then it goes through the same repeatable system. It all shows up on the SEC's website. So if you went to like Sec dot gov and search rally, you'll find like thousands of pages of documents. You can kind of like do, do a command f and find like dinosaur or NFT and see all the paperwork that we submitted and all the sort of risk factors and the elements that make it real is all part of that submission process as well.
Speaker C: Very cool. I just pulled, you said Ens domains and I was like, oh my gosh, I got to see this.
Speaker A: I mean, these are all things to like, especially with nfTs. Anytime we started buying personally at rally, it turned this like, yo, we got to get this for the platform and here's why. And it's like it never with NFTs in particular and with Enf domains really in particular with the and S domains. After the airdrop, everybody was so hyped that they got free money.
Speaker C: It was like a year ago Christmas day. We like right around Christmas, everybody had this massive airdrop.
Speaker A: Yeah, everybody walked into the office so happy that day. It was bonkers because Rory Tate, who's on our team, who was like our resident expert from day one, was telling everybody like, you have to buy your own name and reverse match it to your metamask wallethood right now. And no one, everyone's like, fine, rory, fine, we'll do it. We'll do it just to get him off our back. And then everybody woke up with like eleven grand for free and was like thanking him as soon as they walked through the door.
Speaker C: That's amazing.
Speaker B: For the people, for the people that are listening right now, like what we're looking at, you have 105 ETH and Ens domain alongside the tickets from the Jesse, the 1936 Olympics where Jesse Owens wins gold medal 1st, 1st edition copy of Treasure island, first edition copy of Doctor Jekyll Mister Hyde, and first edition copy of a Tale of two Cities. Are you kidding me?
Speaker A: That's the idea. It's like, yo, everybody, what a world.
Speaker B: What a world we live in.
Speaker A: Dude, this is what all of this was built for. The way information travels. Now, there should never be a situation where there's something I care about, I truly believe in as an investment. And I don't have access to it for like ten or 15 or $20. So if you have an opportunity, if we have an opportunity to bring that to a community, whether it's like a giant, everybody knows it type of thing, like with certain baseball cards and with now with like Enes domains or it's small where it's like that Charles Dickens book group, like the book club of 100 people really want to have access to it. We're just trying to find the best stuff and make it available. Let the market decide what that price should be.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's super cool, I think. You know, it's funny, I haven't been to on rally in a while and it's so cool to see how the assets that you guys have gotten into have one, differed and two, just the sheer volume. Like I was a very early rally user and there was a handful of things on here at the time and it was so it's really, really cool to see how this has evolved over time. You know, part of this too is one, there's a trading aspect to this that's really cool, right? You could, you could have conviction in something, buy a share of it and you know, trade it just like anything else. See it go up and down. And then to like, you know, you could have just such a portfolio of cool stuff, right? Like, I don't have enough room in my house to have all these, you know, these, these cool things, right? Like, but you could really own a piece. You can kind of own a piece of a museum. You know what I mean? Like if you, if you spread yourself out with things you like, I think it's really, really awesome.
Speaker A: But I appreciate that that's what you just described too, because we, we had our first museum here in New York on Lafayette street under our hq was around like 800 small space that we had an eighties era Aston Martin in the middle of it. And then like game Warren Jordan jersey, a crazy expensive Birkin bag. We had all this cool stuff in there, but it was just like the middle of this block in Soho with the doors open. We didn't like ever promote it. It was just retail. Like walk in and then people walk in and be like, what the hell is all of this? Why is this here? So now with the future is history. With the new project that we're doing, we're building our second museum space specifically around like the NFT drop and the assets that are associated with it will be in this giant, brand new museum that we have on Broadway and Howard, like a massive space with the idea that, like, everything should be, this stuff should be in a museum, but it should be accessible too. It shouldn't be tucked away in like some random museum somewhere behind like a bunch of closed doors and 4000 guys with machine guns. It should be accessible to the people who know and care about it most and the people that are invested in it. So that's gonna be the next iteration of the museum.
Speaker C: Yeah. That's really cool. I think I remember when I first was on rally, like, it was mostly cars. I believe it was. It was mostly these. It was mostly cars like this, I think. But that's an awesome segue. Let's get into the future is history stuff. Before we get started with that, we are giving away courtesy of Rob and rally. We're giving away 20 allow us spots. We're giving away a free futures history NFT, which is a $600 value, which is awesome. So the way we're going to do that chamber, drop the link to the, drop the Twitter link into the chat here. All you got to do is go retweet this link. We'll pull winners after the show and we will reach out to you. So we're at 20 allow those spots and we've got one winner for the top winner will win the free NFT. But let's get into what's going on with the futures history. I'm going to bring this up on screen. So talk a little bit about like the background of it, how it came to be. What I love about this so far is that it ties so perfectly into what you guys do as your core, at your core of rally. So I love this idea. Talk a little bit about the origin of it.
Speaker A: Yeah. So I mean, this whole collection really is like a natural progression for us as a business to open up true and new utility in a branded collection. So we reconnected with Kenan Wells, who's the designer behind Pixel hall of Fame, who does this amazing eight bit and 16 bit kind of Nintendo style designs, massive nostalgia behind them of a lot of legends in sports and a few other, like, in history. So we did know it was actually a year ago. We did it on Black Friday in 2021. We dropped a 720 card set with him based on a bunch of assets that were on rally and we had like signatures in them and holograms and all this cool stuff. And they sold out immediately. They were on eBay literally 20 minutes later for $1,000 and super liquid. Even to this day. Individual cards get sold for a ton of money and PSA started grading them and it became like a whole thing. So we were like, we got to follow up on this. We have to do something that really opens us up to more people, but do where there's a digital component too. So the long and short of is that we got this incredible art from Pixel hall of Fame that matches the nostalgia of rally in terms of look and feel. So it's 3500 nfTs. They're based on 15 characters from throughout history. That's everything from like George Washington to Gandhi, to fictional characters like Rosie the Riveter, big brother from 1984, Van Gogh, Edgar Allan Poe. All these different kind of legends from throughout history. All different trades, rarities, all one of ones. And that's going to be in the reveal. Those NFTs are connected to trading cards. So those are part of the NFT purchase. So it's a five card pack. You're one of one NFT that you get on that reveals, guaranteed to be in the pack. And then we add a bunch of random holograms, autographs, historical documents embedded in those cards. So you're getting something really unique in every single pack as well. Then the last piece of it are the equity offerings. And that's what we know best. That's what we've been doing really well for a long time. So the, every single one of these characters will have assets and equity offerings opening on rally that are tied to the character in the set. So you get a chance to get real equity and real assets, and we're doing real ownership. So we're gonna have like collectible giveaways, got a bunch of pieces that go with it that if you own George Washington and there's a George Washington signed check, then you guys will get to be the ones in the raffle that goes with it. All the elements that we put together start with the NFT, they end in that equity. And then there's the museum and all the physical experiences tied to it. So, you know, it's a $600 mint price, so it's expensive. I'm not even going to be the lie to anybody and say that's a cheap mint. In the environment that we're in right now, we theoretically could have, at the height of all this, probably done a significant project, minted out super quick, not promised anything on the back end of it. That's just never ever been us. We've been a business for seven years. We handle real securities. We know how to. How to bring things to life, how to run events, how to source assets. That's been our bread and butter forever. So we really want to tie all that together. If you're a new rally user, we want you to come here and start with the digital and work through it. And if it's something that you feel like you're getting value out of it, awesome. If not, you'll be able to sell it on whatever secondary market you want. You keep anything you got along the way. There's not like a burn or any type of stuff. You're getting the pieces each month we have our roadmap that's in the white paper on the website that he pulled up to that kind of explains that we're gonna start delivering ASAP. As soon as this is done, then the museum opens. Q one, that'll be the first set of events that go with it as well. So, I mean, there's a lot, there's a million things going on within a reality to us. It's all part of that core mission of opening the doors to new types of spends and new types of investments and new types of collectibles. Whether it's digital or physical, it's all the same to us, you know?
Speaker C: Yeah. So, one, I love it, too. I wanted to bring it back to the actual rally site here because I'm looking at an example, I believe, of how this is going to operate on, you know, the. The connection between the physical and the digital here. So what we're looking at here is a 918 60 Lincoln Telegram check. Autographed, I guess, signed, right. So, but it's got the, you know, the Pixel hall of Fame PFP of Abe Lincoln here. So is that what you're saying? Is that the tie in from the physical to the NFT, is that only holder or only people that actually have this Lincoln PFP will be able to be equity owners in this specific item. Is that how it's going to work?
Speaker A: We're going to do a bunch of things. So there's going to be certain things that are just for the holder, certain things that are for everybody, but you're guaranteed to get in. There's a little elements of it that we're building out with the giveaways where there's stuff that goes on rally right now that'll be like, you know, the million dollars and up. And we have a calendar that's pretty well set for the next six to eight to twelve months. Right now, we're going for those specific items and it's hard to change that now because that's part of our roadmap. But we know there are deep communities that love Lincoln and want access to the Lincoln stuff, so we're going out and getting that for them. And part of the secondary market that we set up, too, is that, you know, the sales and any of the royalty that we get from that secondary market is going back into buying individual assets that we could distribute back to the community, to those holders of specific assets and of all the assets. So it's not going to be like there'll be token gates set up and there'll be ways to sort of get in and out to make sure that it's, you know, verified that you own that. NFT. But at the same time, there's going to be elements where it's for everybody, and whether that's merch or museum experience or giveaways, all that's going to be for everybody. Broad stroke, regardless of the character you have, too. So it'll be both.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's really interesting because in theory, I mean, you know, I've witnessed some of these rally ipos, right? And they go, some of them go insanely fast. Like you can't even, you can't even get in if you, if you're not, I mean, seconds, right. And so when you describe something like, you know, this, where it's got this massive community behind it, but you're kind of allow listed because you have the Lincoln PFP, like that's, that's value. Right. Because you're, you're essentially being able to get in at this ipo price for something that, you know, is kind of going to have this very liquid, very active secondary market on it and, and that's, you know, obviously outside of the collectible. But just having access that to something that, you know, is in theory, going to go very quickly is actual, you know, pretty, pretty valuable, I would think. Right?
Speaker A: Yeah. And we're trying to do something a little bit different with this, too. We're taking a page out of like nouns, down a few others in terms of the way governance works, we've, for the last six to twelve months, we've been trying a lot of new stuff in preparation for this project in particular of, you know, we've always done like voting on exits when a buyout offer comes in. We started to do live voting in app where you can watch the tally real time. That's gonna be part of the, that's cool. We're starting to do things where if we feel like there's a market, and we could bring something to auction with one of our auction partners, we could do something. We feel like the market is right, allowing individuals who own this equity or part of the project to vote on whether or not we take those assets, send them the equity, and find the distribution for all those when it sells. So there's all these elements that are like, really about a our community who knows us well. They're the ones who've always been the base. They're gonna get access to this starting on Friday as well. And they're going to be one of, you know, our loyal users will make sure that they get in and then opening it up. If you have sort of been curious about equity ownership, fractionalization, any of these pieces, but the NFT is way more interesting to you as an entry point. We want to make sure that new communities can come in and get this deeper understanding of what the collectible marketplace looks like in a fractional world like ours. So it's really like as much or as little as you want it to be. The NFT itself is, to me, is dope. And it's something that I look at and I'm like, it's been my avatar since we started doing any of this, any of this work. When I had Keenan, he's been working on the art for six months at this point. Like, the first one he sent became my avatar immediately. Because to me, it's this nostalgic, awesome thing. And I've been following him for so long, and I've been a fan. All the cards, the equity, the giveaways, the museum piece, everything that goes with it is part of that $600 entry for the mint. So if you want to sort of come in, you know, rally, you want to pay with credit card, you're done. You want to come in, link a wallet, just be part of the NFT community. We're going to build that whole thing out. You can be a part of it, too, but it's as little or as much as you want it to be, basically.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's super cool. And I think there's really unique kind of flywheel of offering that you have here, right. Because it does really tie in so well to your core business and this idea of collecting and owning, which is really what we're all here for in the web three space. You're either here to collect, or you're here to own, or you're here to buy assets that you think are going to appreciate. And on top of that, you're here for the utility that those things provide. And you're very uniquely positioned because you're this business that has been operating successfully outside of the space for so long to kind of, you're really positioned to be a very unique community that ties all of those things together. And that's what I'm super excited about. I, it's funny, I have, you know, I mentioned earlier I was a really early rally user. Like, I was on there in 2018, 2019. Yeah.
Speaker A: If you, if you remember the cars, you're early, man.
Speaker C: Yeah, right. It was, it was mostly cars there. And, and I have gone away from it for a while because I got into, you know, kind of collecting things on my own and then getting into the NFT space and collecting and buying there. And I'm, and this is going to bring me back. Like, I'm not even kidding.
Speaker A: I appreciate that, dude. That's what we're going to. For. I mean, just, yeah, but we're also, we look at it like, right now is a really trying time for anybody who went all in on crypto or all in on nfts, you know, twelve months ago, 18 months ago. And for us, like, we believe in the long term viability not just of web three, but of nfts as digital collectibles. So for us, we, we didn't. Building in a bear market, it's like the old, it's like an adage and it's a, it's a buzz term now. It's like, yay. But now it's time to build whatever. Like, we, there was no reason to think with that crazy meteoric rise that we wouldn't see a time like this where quality is going to matter way more than quantity. And then the idea that there's always this market for, like, memberships and community that people care about, it's not, it's not specific to crypto. Our community has, has been through one or two of these pullbacks. At this point. They stuck with us. We provided returns everywhere we can. We've hunkered down. We had to. And now, like, you know, no matter the size of the business, you have to be building brand and building experience. There's no better way to do that with our existing users. Bring some people back like you're talking about, but also bring some new people in who maybe want to sort of add some physical collectibles to what they've been buying and what they've been investing in in the NFT space for twelve or 18 months now that we're in this little retrace period. So we wanted to sort of be personalized. And the idea that we can bring people back and reactivate community that's always cared about us is a huge part of that, too. So I'm glad to hear that.
Speaker C: Yeah, well, there's also, I mean, like, just this joy of collecting stuff, right? Like this. Of really cool things. Like, we were talking in our dj network discord the other day, and, you know, mostly we're a group of, like, NFT D gen flippers, right? But we started talking about. I was bringing up the subject of, you know, physical collectibles, and we really struck up this conversation about who owns these really cool things and what people are into, and we ended up deciding we need to spin up a physical collectibles channel, and so we could kind of talk about that stuff. And I think this is a really interesting avenue, even just internally, for our community to explore together, which is pretty cool. So, yeah, I love this chamber. Before we get to our last bit of nonsense that Rob doesn't know about yet, anything to add?
Speaker B: No. I mean, I was. I'm interested in. Is there a way. What I really want to know is, I don't know about you guys, but I'm way I spend my crypto riches way quicker than I spend my, you know, my. In real life. Is there a way where I can. Can I purchase any of these? I just want to buy everything. I don't want just a little piece of it. Can I dump my eth, can I dump my USDC and get, you know, take $2.8 million of my, you know, my wealth?
Speaker C: $2.8 million.
Speaker B: I was just looking at the Declaration of Independence.
Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. You could take. You could take this. You could take that small percentage of your total liquid eth net worth and dump it into a rally. And we have a. So, in each of these individual assets, there's a little button that says, do you want to buy the whole asset? Let's talk. And that opens up a form that shows you what the FMV is right now, what the field to put your offer in. It goes to our team. They qualify that offer really quickly, and then we bring it to a vote with our investors. So there's a 48 hours window that we allow all of them to kind of voice their opinion on whether or not the price is right. Once it's kind of more than 51%, it goes to our third party advisory board to kind of ratify it. And then we get everybody that distributions quick, and we will hand deliver you the Declaration of Independence should the vote go through it's cut the whole white gloves.
Speaker C: Do you meet at a random rest stop in.
Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I would want if.
Speaker A: It was one of you guys. We want to make sure, any way that you're comfortable doing it. If you're comfortable doing deals like you are on the side of the road, meeting a guy in an early eighties Honda accord to drop off, I'm down to do it. I'll make it happen.
Speaker C: That's funny, man.
Speaker B: That's terrific.
Speaker A: All right.
Speaker B: That's good to know. That's good to know. Okay.
Speaker C: I want to. I want to now see what music pieces you're going to buy here. Chamber?
Speaker B: I think so. I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been studying for our next segment, unknowingly to you guys, and none of it is music. There are some, there are some things that I really, I'm a big history guy, too, so most of them are going to be historic things. So.
Speaker C: So, Rob, what we do here every week on our show, sometimes with our guests, sometimes with just us, we do a draft and we do a little snake draft, and each one of us will go, we'll pick an item and then we'll put that out on a Twitter poll and see who won, who does the draft the best. So, you know, we've done things like Halloween candy, we've done things like scary movies or, you know, anything like that. Today we're going to draft actual assets here on rally that we would want to own. So chamber, I want to let you go first. And Rob is the expert on his own platform. So we usually have to guess go first. But you're going, you're going in the middle this time because it's snake draft. So chamber and I will get two on each side and you'll have to.
Speaker A: Kind of navigate the wraparound move is what you want. So I'm kind of pissing.
Speaker C: Chamber, I'll let you go first.
Speaker B: So there are, I definitely recommend everybody hop on this fight because there are so many things on this. I didn't even get to all of them yet, but from what I've seen right off the hop, I brought it up earlier. I'm going to take the 1936 Jesse Owens gold medal tickets. Not only the Jesse Owens, just you demolish everybody at that Olympics. That's also the Olympics that Hitler got all butthurt and walked out on. So it's a twofer. You not only to get the Jesse Owens stuff, but you also get to own, you know, not own Hitler, but like, own him in the. In the youthful way, but, yeah, I think that one off the hop is going to be my first pick.
Speaker A: That was almost too easy. Dude, you picked. You picked one of the most demonic characters in all of history that everybody has one singular opinion on, and you went with it. I'll give you credit for that.
Speaker C: Yeah. But can he fit. Can he fit all of that into a Twitter poll is the real question. Rob, for context, though, also, Chamber has never won one of these polls.
Speaker B: Never. Never once.
Speaker C: Not one time has he ever won.
Speaker B: We've done dozens of them.
Speaker C: Chamber, when we do these on Twitter, we should grab a picture, like, a screenshot, like I'm showing here on screen, and put them, like, underneath, so we can actually have, you know, context to what we're talking about. Okay, Rob, you're up.
Speaker A: I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go in honor of chamber, I'm gonna go with the Beatles love me do single, which is the first single. I think it's signed, too. And it's also.
Speaker B: That's a good one. I actually named. Both my kids are. Have Beatles references in their middle names.
Speaker A: Nice.
Speaker B: Yeah. Miss that.
Speaker C: Really? I didn't know that. That's very interesting.
Speaker A: A young ringo, perhaps?
Speaker B: No, I have. So I have. My oldest daughter's middle name is Rigby, and my youngest daughter's middle name is darling from.
Speaker A: I'm sorry for doxxing your children, so I apologize.
Speaker B: No, that's all right. They're on here all the time.
Speaker C: That's really funny. All right, so that's a good one. I'm going. So I may. Prior to. Prior to being in NFTs, I was a big, you know, physical card collector. So for me, I'm actually going with the. I'm going with the t 206.
Speaker A: I forgot about that one. That's a layup, too.
Speaker C: I'm going with the Honus Wagner T 206. You know, Chamber, we should. I'm not sure that we should just straight up put the value of these out there, because I'm afraid that might sway.
Speaker B: I agree. I was looking at that, too, because there are some things that I like that the value is not necessarily $1.8 million. You know what I mean?
Speaker C: Correct. And that's fine. So I think we should just like. The idea is to. For the poll is to evoke the emotion of the thing. Right.
Speaker B: So, like, what's the year of this card, by the way?
Speaker A: That would help. It was between 1907 to 1909. So it was in a good cigarette pack in that first run.
Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And there, yeah, there's not very many of them that exist, which is why it takes a $1.8 million here. So I'll do the. I got the wraparound. I think I'm going to play a little bit to the home crowd here, and I'm going to go with the VR crypto punk here. Punk number 8103, because I'm, again, lowly podcaster. Can't afford my own crypto punk. Always wanted one. Might as well legally grab a fraction.
Speaker A: Of once going with the value play. I like it. I like it.
Speaker C: So that. That's my second pick here. There's so many cool things here. It's going to be crazy to see how the people vote. So, Rob, we're back to you.
Speaker A: I like it. In honor of an NFT pet of the NFT rock selling at a massive discount over the last three days, I'm going to go with the. I'm going to go with the gold nugget, which is a 172 grams gold nugget on that one, which is like, the idea of digital gold versus tangible gold. I'm going to play that role on this.
Speaker C: Oh, I love that. Yeah, I love that. All right, cool. That's a really cool. Oh, you see this chamber? Yeah. You see this down here?
Speaker B: Oh, no, I didn't see that one.
Speaker A: Oh, that's got sandbox. Simpsons cars are dope, though. That was like a real childhood thing, too.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker C: By the way, chamber, you actually used to own a whole one of this, right under that, the sandbox estate.
Speaker B: I sold my. I think I sold mine for more than that.
Speaker C: You might have. You sold the top of the sandbox.
Speaker B: Well played, my friend. So for my pick, for my next. Oh, I get two, right?
Speaker C: You get two. You close yours out right now.
Speaker B: Okay. So I'm gonna. I'm actually going in the same, you know, no pun intended, vein as the gold nugget here. I'm gonna go with the 561 to 546 BC first gold coin. We are on the cusp of the digital currency eradic, so I might as well have the other end of that with the start of the first gold coin era.
Speaker A: Smart man.
Speaker B: Yeah, I like that one a lot. I think that's very cool. My second one, or my last pick, I should say, is going to be the lunar meteorite, which is very cool. I found out a cool fact the other day that because of the way the. The atmosphere of the moon is, or the lack thereof, the last. Let me make sure I say this right, the last proof of existence of mankind. So say everybody's all gone, you know, a billionaire a billion years from now, everybody's gone. There's no. There's no trace of buildings or anything left. The only thing that will let anybody know that we were ever around is the footprint of Neil Armstrong on the moon. On the moon will still be there a billion years from now. Very cool. Very cool. Fun fact for you kids out there.
Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm going to meet some friends in a little bit. I'm going to get them in a huddle and tell this story. They're going to think I'm the smartest person in the room. Thank you for that.
Speaker C: That's awesome. So you wait. So chamber, you're done. What are your three?
Speaker B: So I have the Jesse Owen gold medal race tickets. I got the first gold coin and I got the lunar meteorite.
Speaker C: Right. All right, so, Rob, you're finishing yours out right now.
