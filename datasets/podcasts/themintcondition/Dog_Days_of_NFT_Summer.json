I do radio ads and video ads and stuff like that. And it's always been super fun, but it's always been on other people's terms. And web three has enabled me to make content that I want to make just because I think it's funny or fun. And the value is never been, it's never really been like a monetary value. It's just been. I finally feel like I can create stuff that other people would care about. And so my web three journey started around, like, right before vfriends. I had made my own nft just to see what it was like. And then Gary V announced and I had followed him for a bit. I knew some people that worked for him and I was like, this isn't easy mint. And I knew how to do it, so I was able to mint a really great v friend right off the bat. And then from there, I went and got a mutant ape and some other things. Missed the board. Ape.

I'm a yes guy. That's what I do. I say yes, and I say it often. And it's exciting for me. If my friends have anything going on, I want to be part of it. So that's it. So I helped launch a project called Thingdoms. And me and Luke and Owen created a radio station called Thing FM. And it was a lot of fun, and it needed more margin than I could give it. And that's, that's the duality of having a real life job at the same time. I'm sure you guys have no idea what that means. No, I'm kidding. Trying to navigate real work and fake work is what I call it. And here I am. I did, I did a stint. I did three months with sup ducks. I did a radio show with them called Waking Sup. I'm still kind of finishing that out, but that will be kind of the basis of some of the people I bring over from the, the morning show. So that's me, and I'm excited to be here. Really am. It's really great people. I met so many of you in Minnesota. A few of I know I met Steve and Chris in Minnesota, but me and Steve had talked for a bit. Just a great guy.

We're going through this crypto winter and lack of liquidity and people selling everything they have, and moonbirds have held very steady because of the nesting mechanism where people don't want to sell, they want to lock it up there. And, you know, the other thing is, you're so early in this life cycle of what they're going to release as product. Right. So, you know, if you had, if I had to trade all my moon birds for a bored ape right now, I wouldn't do it, because I think the return of things that I'm going to get in this ecosystem is better than what I would get if I bought an ape right now because of somebody are in their life cycle.
