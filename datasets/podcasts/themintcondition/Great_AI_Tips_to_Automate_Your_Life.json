So Google is introducing a feature called Pixel screenshots that uses on device AI to make screenshots. Searchable which is interesting. So the AI will analyze and save metadata from your screenshots to enhance searchability and provide useful information. This is interesting. Chamber. I'd always seen kind of, there was a couple years ago where I feel like we got spooked about how much data you actually can find just from somebody taking a picture on your phone. Right. Like Apple shows you now the location and everything like that. So, yeah, so there's a lot you can get from just a picture or now. But this is interesting that it's pulling metadata from screenshots. So pixel screenshots will be used for AI to summarize and process details. The processing will save metadata such as web links, app names and timestamps. All that data is going to be processed and stored on your device. So that's ensuring kind of your privacy and security. Users can turn on or off this AI processing in their app settings if they prefer not to use it. And. But ultimately this is going to enhance the ability to search for specific information within screenshots. I don't know if you're like me, chamber, but how many screenshots you got on your phone?"

So practically, like, you'll be able to now locate important details from this without manually searching your photo library. For businesses, this could possibly enhance productivity by allowing employees to retrieve crucial information or save and search all of that kind of stuff. So pretty interesting if you.

So, you know, we keep seeing these insane advancements very quickly in terms of assets you can create that used to take very specialized people with skill, with a certain set of skills that would take you a long time. Right? So this matters because this is an advancement in AI, 3d modeling, which not a lot of people have gotten right so far. So this has obviously the potential to revolutionize a bunch of different industries that are reliant on 3d assets such as, you know, like gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality, and just, you know, video creation, animation as well. So, you know, for personal use. Obviously this is a super interesting creative tool for, you know, projects, hobbies. I could see you trying to, you know, create some teeny tiny little puppies out of this and showing them to your kids.

This particular one. They have partnered with the estates of these folks like Judy Garland, James Dean, and the like to bring their voices to the reader app. So the reader app is the other thing I wanted to point out to you. If you haven't seen this yet, it's actually really compelling. So this mobile app that you can download, you can actually like drop a link to an article you're reading and it loads it in there and it actually will read it to you out loud rather than you actually having to read it. So it basically turns any article into a podcast. Really interesting. So I've used it. I actually really enjoy it because instead of reading, I'll passively listen to stuff while I work, which is interesting. But the eleven Labs reader app is so what it does is converts digital text into voiceovers using AI. So there's a bunch you can pick from. And now some of these famous voices like Judy Garland, James Dean, Burt Reynolds, Lawrence Olivier Reynolds is dead. I don't know. Or he's just. Is he? I don't even know."

All right, two more quick stories here from the world of AI. This one also comes from the creative realm, from Runway ML. So chamber, the last couple weeks we've seen these crazy video models drop, we've seen commercials being made and Runway says hold my beer. They have introduced the gen three Alpha, which is their new AI video model, generating high fidelity, controllable video content. And this is to enhance video creation capabilities with consistency and motion control. Have you seen any of these videos yet?"

But this supports text to video, image to video, and text to image transformations. It offers fine grained control over structure, style, motion as well. And some of these new safeguards include a visual moderation system. So you're not going to be able to do any copyright stuffed, but, and it's, I guess they're saying that it's integrating with existing and upcoming tools for more detailed content. This is interesting. So again, significantly for in this technology, easier for creators to create high quality dynamic content and video. This stuff keeps blowing my mind every day. It's just like, it's wild. Like what do you think when you see this? Like you've seen now full commercials and stuff with this, but yeah. Really?"

So that's why you've seen people do things with like memes on Luma, because you can start with that frame the keyframe image here. No, you can't. I don't believe you could do image to video here yet with three. So yeah, these are all generated I love just from text prompts. It's friggin wild, isn't it?"

So this is interesting. So if you've ever used perplexity, it's a really cool user interface pain.

Users can upload and analyze unlimited files, integrating them into their search queries and pro search ensures high level accuracy and relevance in its responses. This is super cool. I mean, I could see how students, researchers, data analytics, analysis would all use this perplexities already. I think the best way to search. But you can see here, it gave you no give you a correct answer, right? So, but then did it give you sources up top too? So it like goes a little further. So normally what you would get here is like in Google, it's your five links, they're usually all ads and whatever, and then you got to click through everything to find your answer. And here you've got all your sources up top, and then it kind of synthesizes everything to an answer for you, which is really cool. So this is just the basic perplexity, not the pro that we're talking about. But that pro sounds like process, it does exist."

You want to get to the article, just go click one of those and you're good to go. It actually kind of remembers what you're talking about here. And so here you can ask follow ups. It actually will suggest, it actually will suggest related articles as well as some follow up questions potentially for you as well, which I really like. And so, like, if you're asking about something that you're trying to learn about some of those like, follow up prompts that it gives you is, is really interesting. Right. Because you kind of like go down this tree of learning and rabbit holes. Chris wants to know, why are you messing with my head? When did it change to Wednesdays, Chris?

So Zapier's tagline at some point, I believe, was the glue of the Internet, because all these companies, all these SaaS products, all the things that you use every day, are connected to the Internet and can be, and can talk to each other through APIs. And so when you have these API connections or when you have these APIs, it basically means that all of them can talk to each other. They've made these no code platforms like Zapier and make.com, so that people like myself. Or you can connect different pieces of the softwares that you're using every day to create these automated workflows or to just do things that do nothing, you know, normally connect. So here Chris says zappier linking chat, GPT to all the wonderful tools we use day in and day out. And that's correct. Yes. So that's what I've been obsessed about. And it's got me thinking about all of these things that we could do to automate a bunch of different processes in our lives. So I'm going to show you one chamber. This is the tip of the iceberg that I've been working on for you. We've been doing this show together for so long, and I just take, take, and I never give, I never give back to you.

Then once it does that, it's passing to Claude. So this is Claude, and we are activating the Claude Opus model here. So one of the brand new Claude models here, you've got a prompt. So in this prompt, I'll kind of walk through what each one of these does. In a second, you got a little more code. This going out to YouTube. This is updating YouTube. And this one is coming back to airtable to finish the job off at the end. Right. So what's actually happening here? I'll show you this in a second. So we're going to start with our airtable. So super easy. It literally looks like an excel sheet, right. And I've just created here YouTube link, video id, chapters, etcetera. So I took one of our wonderful podcasts. I've got the link here, drop it here. It's automatically going to grab me this YouTube id, right. That's because I just did a little formula. Now, once I have that in my airtable, I'm going back here and we're going to then pass that id into the python script. The python script is going to basically get a transcript of the video. It's going to pass the transcript and timestamp. It's going to pass the transcript to Claude, who is going to read it and timestamp it."

You know, push cars with their feet, and the little one had, you know, a smaller baby one, and the big one had this very cool other version of one, and the baby started riding it, and, like, because now he can ride it, and it has caused so much chaos in our house.
