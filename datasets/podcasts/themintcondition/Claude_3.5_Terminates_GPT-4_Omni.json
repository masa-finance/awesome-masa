So, first story here, this comes from Twitter, from a user at Perry Carial at Perrikryal and chamber. When I saw this, this blew my mind. This is like, AI plus. Like, we've seen a ton of, you know, advancements in technology in the last couple months. In the last year, last 18 months, I had known things like this were coming and possible. You've seen, you know, Elon, talk about neuralinken, and I've seen some crazy things where people are doing smaller versions of what you're seeing here on the screen. But Perry tweets here from June 22. We did it. Shadow of Erdtree, first boss completed with mind control and zero hands. I can't believe it. This was the hardest thing ever. We've come so far. Let's go. And this is a video of her beating a final boss in a level with, literally, her mind. You can see her hands on the screen all of the time, and then she posts the full video underneath it. She was doing this live on twitch, and. Pretty incredible. This has all been done with her brain. Uh, what. What do you think about this?"

        "speaker": "B",

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, so it's funny, I had seen a video on this, I don't know, about a year ago, where a guy puts one of these headsets on, and essentially how it was working was he was turning his thoughts into HTML and JSON, and he is filtering it then through, like, chat, GPT, and things like that. And he was taking his thoughts and putting them into words, which was crazy. I hadn't seen anything quite like this before. This blew my mind when I saw it. So mind control coming to a theater near you chamber. If you could do this, if you had this. This piece of hardware here, what is the first thing you would do with your mind?"

But I think this is a real life thing where they can kind of manipulate, you know, they have dexterity using their mind. So I'm assuming it's probably something similar to that, but not sure it is. It's mind blowing, though."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "It is mind blowing, in fact. So. All right, we've got next piece of AI news. So this is coming from more of a marketing advertising creative lens here. So we've got a tweet here from boring ads. I'm boring ads. And this news is coming from TikTok. So we've talked about TikTok on this show, how the platform is obviously blowing up, not only in terms of the content platform, the algorithm, but TikTok shop has been blowing up. Have you done much research or looked into TikTok shop lately?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I was on your to do list, like, a month ago. I'm pretty sure. But if I go back in our text messages, I think I probably told you to look into TikTok shop a month ago. But if you haven't looked into TikTok shop yet, it is 100%, like, the fastest growing e commerce trend. It is following this trend of, you know, Twitter spaces with social audio. But it's social commerce. Right. And it's. The idea of social commerce is huge in China already, specifically, even, like, live social commerce, where people are live selling you things on, you know, on TikTok. And the sales are astronomical. Like, the volume that these companies are doing, small companies, niche companies are doing on TikTok shop is wild. And what's crazy about it and why it's happening is they've created this insane kind of affiliate flywheel. So you're familiar with affiliate marketing, correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So it's, you know, pretty standard. It's been around forever. That part is not groundbreaking. The thing that's super interesting about Tick Tock shop is right now, tick Tock's growing this platform and really pushing the shop aspect of it. They are subsidizing a ton of on platform discounts to the tone, to the tune of, like, 20, 30%. Meaning if you are a yemenite seller, you're getting the full amount, but tick Tock is actually subsidizing those discounts. So it's incentivizing people to grow or to come and sell on the platform. But then there's this crazy flywheel that's going on tick tock. Creators. I think the minimum you have to have on followers is either 1000 followers on tick tock or 5000. It's gone. But it was 5000. They switched it to 1000. I feel like they've gone back, but I'm not quite sure. But if you have that amount of followers, you're eligible for like the creator shop and all of this stuff. And what companies are doing is basically seeding products to creators to make viral videos and selling their product. And the creators are getting insane commissions to the tune of 20, 30% commission, everything they sell because of the volume. I mean, you've got people, you've got kids that instead of working fast food jobs are pulling in fifty k a month from TikTok affiliate stuff. And it doesn't take a lot to go viral and make sales on this platform if you know what you're doing. And so this particular story is kind of the next version of where this is going and how easy they're making. They're making this for creators. And so this tweet says this is what the ad platform of the future looks like. TikTok is releasing symphony, it's creative AI suite. This is going to level the playing field for advertisers around the world and build multiple eight, nine figure success stories. Remember how much money it was to work with creators for UGC footage? Did you have to go back and forth, make sure they understood the brief? And so this is basically a way for a brand or a, a, you know, small business owner to create this type of user generated content style videos with AI. So TikTok's the first to do this. We've seen people doing this with, you know, kind of patched together AI tools like, you know, mid journey and eleven labs and things like that. But now TikTok has created a full on AI suite here. So it's got the ability to essentially take a product URL, write a description, give it the proper tags, all of that. Then you can set your video recording and voila, you have a user generated content video style with a custom avatar and all of those types of things. And now you've got an ad in seconds. What say you on this chamber and the future of advertising?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I do think TikTok is, you know, the forefront of this type of thing. I've been, you know, I've been captivated by some of these ads I've seen on TikTok. I've purchased at least like five things from TikTok in the past. I do think it's the most, you know, out of all the current social medias, I think they're on the, on the, on the precipice or are on the, they're leading the, the charge when it comes to all the different aspects that social media can bring. So I'm very interested to see what happens, like, in the US. Like, I know there was a lot of talk of, like, tick tock, ban, and that type of thing, so we'll see how that affects it. But yeah, they are leading the charge when it comes to kind of next gen social media. We'll see if anybody else comes around after this. I'm sure there will be, but as of right now, you're, I'm hard pressed to find a better social media app when it comes to this type of thing. So I'm impressed."

        "text": "Yeah, I'm not sure, but the tick tock, it's so early for this. They're doing like 10 billion, I think, at the moment. So there's a lot of room for this. T row says that whatnot is another app that's doing this. He says it benefits the seller, possibly a little better. I have not checked out what, what not. But he also says it's a garage sale on steroids. That is a good way to describe it. So tick Tock AI generated ads with avatars automatically done for you in the style of UGC. Pretty crazy. So a couple more store, smaller stories here. Then we get to the big topic, which is going to be Claude 3.5. But next up, we have more in the AI video. We talked about this last week with some of these new models that were coming out. And here you're seeing a tweet from Mario. No, not. How do you even say this name? Naw. Fall."

        "text": "But there was a movie theater in lend in London that canceled a premiere of a film called the last screenwriter, which is what you're seeing a trailer for on the screen right now from Mario's tweet. And this decision came after receiving 200 complaints about the AI written script. So this was a film that the script was completely written in AI. It says here, in a quote, I think people don't know enough about the project. All they hear is first film written entirely by AI, and they immediately see enemy. So a private screening for the cast and crew still takes place in London. But this goes to kind of this backlash about AI being the enemy, taking potential jobs, taking creative jobs first. And we've kind of seen this as a theme. What I thought was really interesting is the juxtaposition here with the tweet from Alan, Mister Allen T yesterday. So Mister Allen T, if you don't know, I know him personally. One of the most talented AI creatives out there, makes incredible videos, does just really, really incredible AI gen AI work. So shouts to Alan, but he tweeted this yesterday, which got 4.8 million views, 3.5k bookmarks, 7.4k likes. And this is a actual commercial that Toys R Us released using OpenAI Sora as the. So it's the first generated brand commercial. And this commercial here, it's, you know, about a minute long, and it tells the story of how the founder of Toys R Us created, essentially, Jeffrey. And I guess the story of Jeffrey is that he came to the founder in a dream and then he ran with it. So really interesting here, though. So you've got on one hand, a AI written film script that's getting taken out of theaters because of backlash, totally juxtaposed with a high generated television commercial for a brand. What are your thoughts on, I guess, both of these things. Do you ever wonder how to."

And, like, toy Story obviously was the first big one, and it was amazing. And it's, you know, it changed the game, but there was a lot of shittier versions of that. That's what this reminds me of. So I don't doubt in a year from now if Toys R us did the exact same commercial, it would look significantly better.

I'm interested to see what, like, if you're making a story about AI taking over, it is very interesting to use AI to write that story that is, you know, for that specific movie. I think that's a really, really smart idea. But I still think it's, you know, again, in my mind, it's like 510 years. But in reality, it's probably a year or two in AI world, everything happens so fast. I'll be interested to see if AI can come up, and I know it comes down to the prompts that you're putting in and what you're asking of the AI, but will we see AI come up with unique storylines?

There's going to be a reduction in quality for a certain amount of time. Whether it's the quality of this commercial we're talking about, whether it's, you know, somebody putting out a movie script or putting out an animated tv show saying, like, another couple years from now where it's completely age AI generated with AI voices and an AI script, I'll be interested to see what the quality of that show like. I do. I anticipate it's the next Simpsons or South park. No, probably not. They had people thinking outside of the box to come up with storylines. You know what I mean?"

Anyway, all right, we're on to our main AI topic of the day, which is Claude 3.5. So chamber, you know, chat GPT. I've gotten you on the chat GPT train.

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, so Claude is, you know, a chat GBT competitor created by Anthropoc, which is the name of the larger lab company. And last week, they. Oh, gosh, was it even last week, June 20? Yeah. So about a week ago, they just released Claude 3.5, a new model that surpasses GPT four O on multiple benchmarks while being two times faster and 80% cheaper than their highest level model. So right now, Claude has. So just like GPT, right? Just like opening eye. They have open AI, has, you know, GPT 3.5. They have GPT four, and now they have GPT four. Oh, which is for Omni as. So they kind of have three different tiers of models here, same with Claude. They have a base model, I don't remember what it's called. And then they have sonnet, which is the mid tier, and Opus, which was their top tier prior to this. And so this new model they came out with, um, is faster and cheaper than their, than their prior top model was. And so you can see here on this tweet of kind of like where the benchmarks have been in the past, and they use this kind of benchmarking system. If you go down on this tweet here, paying a little, scroll down a little more, you can see the benchmarks here for what, 3.5 sonnet is compared to the other kind of leading models out there. So, um, graduate level reasoning, it beats both GPT 40 and the old three model from anthropic undergraduate level knowledge beats them all as well. It's the same as, uh, GPT four oh coding. This was the big one. It. I've never seen any of them code as well as this model does. It's insane. We'll do a little fun experiment here in a second. Multilingual math. We're talking pushing in the 91 percentile, 92 percentile of accuracy on. If you see these like zero shot, that means first try, no errors, one single shot. It's right 91% of the time. It's insane. So this is beating everything on all benchmarks just from the modeling standpoint. Right. Then they also put out some new, like, user interface innovations with this release, as well as some, I would say, kind of catch up things that OpenAI had prior that they did not. So now you could basically make GPTs, custom GPTs with anthropoclad as well. But the one thing that is very cool that they introduced from a user interface standpoint is this thing called artifacts. And you can see it on the next tweet there pane of in this coding example, where the person is generating code and it's popping up like you've got chat GPT. Everything is done in this one flow of chat. But when you're looking at this now, you can see that it's going to, not only are you able to kind of upload documents now, everything like that, but watch what happens here with this code. You're going to, it's going to pop up on this side here, and we'll do this in a second and you'll see it, you'll see a bigger, a better live demo. But it's pretty incredible from a user interface standpoint. So now you can do, you could do shareable projects. It's got a 200k context window, meaning it's got, see, there's what I'm talking about, that code thing on the side. So now you've got this kind of like side copilot here. That happens. We'll use this here in a second, but we'll run through some of these examples in a tweet that you shared from proper prompter. And I mean, it's incredible what this thing can do. So it's been able to create full operating games in, like, one, one prompt. I showed you something the other day, uh, that I did in three prompts that absolutely blew my mind. Um, did you kind of understand what I was doing there?"

I'm not the only one. Here's what I did today. You want to see? Look. Ever using. Ever using AI. I went and said, my kid is obsessed with Spider man. So I said, my child's a huge fan of Spider man. Lately, he's had a hard time of listening, and he's been talking back, pushing boundaries. He's three and a half. I want to write him a letter from Spider man to teach him about why it's important to listen and behave when asked. Help me draft it. Remember, it should be in the voice tone of Spider man and reference. Spidey is amazing. Friends spinning ghost, spider, etc. Etc. I think it did a pretty good job. Tell me what you think. Hey, there. A little web spill. Web slinger Spidey here. I heard you've been having some trouble listening lately. I know it can be tough sometimes, but I want to tell you why it's super important to be a good listener and follow the rules. You know, my friends spin and Ghost Spider and I work together to keep the city safe. Well, we couldn't do that if we didn't listen to each other and behave. When Ghost Spider tells me there's danger, I have to listen right away. And when Spin has a plan, we all need to follow it to save the day. Sometimes green Goblin or Doc Ock try to cause trouble because they don't want to follow the rules. But we know that's not the right way to act. Even the Hulk, who's super strong, has to listen and be careful not to break things. Your parents are like your very own superhero team. When they ask you to do something, it's because they want to keep you safe and help you grow up to be awesome. Just like how I became Spider man. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. That means when we can do special things, we have to use them the right way. Your special power is being an amazing kid, and part of that is being a good listener. So what do you say? Want to join me in being a superhero? By listening and following the rules. I bet you'd make an amazing spider, kidde. Your friendly neighborhood Spider man. P's keep being incredible and maybe one day you'll join Spidey and his amazing friends."
