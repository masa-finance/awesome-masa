Whether it's just like a thumbnail, a lot of the videos I watch on YouTube, the thumbnail, I can tell is 100% AI generated. Maybe even the voices. Some of them are put together fairly quickly. Where I can kind of tell it's probably an AI generated voice. Also kind of creating, like, these YouTube videos, I see that a lot. I see AI imagery in, like, articles that I see pop up on social media where, like, again, the thumbnail is AI generated. But I would say that's probably it. That's my level.

On this episode, the host discuss, and then I just literally type in. So, like, the last one was bitcoin Blood by American Fud. I put here on this episode, the host discuss a recent turndown in the crypto market, focusing on bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin.

I would say these AI models should be thought of more as reasoning engines, a sparring partner almost, right? Like an assistant a. So you're for show notes. You're using it in a way that would resemble an assistant, right? Which I think is a good use case. But if you went tell me five facts about the roman empire, I would tell you that you are using this stuff incredibly wrong, right?

        "text": "Yeah, pretty much so. But that's why you shouldn't use it as Google, right? It's not supposed to be used that way. So, because, like, think of it like this, I actually used this analogy today, and I actually thought it was a pretty good one. I used it in the context, though, of like information retrieval, in terms of like, being able to provide one of these, you know, custom bots, your own data, right? Like chat GPT doesn't innately have your own personal data. It's just working off of its training set, all of that stuff. But with like custom GPTs, like we were talking about a couple of weeks ago, you can actually load your own knowledge base into it, et cetera, et cetera. And now it's got context of your very specific data. Does that make sense?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So I used the analogy today of like, think of your kid, your oldest, and or you in school, right? Teacher asks you a question and you've had a homework assignment that you were supposed to read chapters one through three, and the teacher calls on you in class to ask you to tell you about chapters one through three. Right. You, who does not have the, who did not do the homework, right. Has no context of what's actually in chapters one through three. However, you're going to try not to embarrass yourself and you're going to try to work through the answer anyway, right. So you might make up a character that's not in the book. You might cite something that's not actually in a page, et cetera, et cetera. You're going to answer the question to the best of your ability, but it'd be very clear to someone who has read it that you're bullshitting. Right? Yeah. I think that's versus them calling on me, who's just hash builtdifferent, who did their homework, read chapters one through three and can tell you precisely what's inside chapters one through three. Three, right. Like you can spot the differences of that, right. So like the hallucination, quote unquote, that chat GPT is doing, it's filling in those gaps where it does not have all the exact information, right. So, like when you ask it about a research paper, it may cite you a research paper that does not exist because does that make sense?"

        "speaker": "A",

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Oh, yeah. It was citing research papers that don't exist or, and then people would actually use it in their own work and get called out on it. Right."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So, like, and the citations would be."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Obviously false and that's wild. But so point being, the actual better way to think about it is not for, I don't think as much for very specific data on, you know, a normal query. It's more so to me, like reasoning and strategy and like a sparring partner or assistant. And like you're going to see agents and all of that kind of cool, crazy stuff. Crocs mentioning in the comments that he finally got GPT four today. Perfect timing, crocs. We did this episode just for you. So first thing you want to do crocs is not ask it questions. You would ask Google. Use it for specific use cases where you have domain expertise. So like chamber, if you were trying to market your cannabis brand or create a social media strategy or things of that nature, that is how you would actually want to use chatub. And so, or many of these different AI. It's not just chat GPT. It goes for, you know, Claude, it goes for any of these other models too."

Rather than just write copy, right? So, like, for example, why don't you ask it some things about creating show plans and all of that kind of stuff? And so the way to prompt that, right, so where you want to give it a little bit of information is just like you did with the show notes. You gave it a role and you gave it a goal, right? Like, that's it. You want to give it a roll. You want to give it a goal at the very base level, and then it's going to use all of its training data to help you complete those goals. So, like, imagine you are talking to somebody who has all of the knowledge that's ever been put on the Internet. That's more knowledge than you have, right? On a base level, would you say?"

Encourage open feedback sessions to address any issues or improvements that can be made. And then third part here is interest alignment.

It provides me a lot of flexibility, not a lot of stress. And both of us have worked in corporate companies for a long time. And when I was in my twenties and early thirties, I wanted to climb that corporate ladder. And as I did, I really found out quickly it's not all it's cracked up to be.

It's walked me through the entire process to the point where now I have working prediction models. Oh, there's a great example. Right? Like, do you know how long that would have taught me in fact, forget how long, I literally could not teach myself. I've tried it. I've tried to teach myself many times over many years, and I've never been able to do it. And so not only was I able to use this as a companion to kind of help me walk through the steps, like, first, I didn't even know what the hell the steps were, so I had to ask. I went through what are the steps? If I want to do x, y, and z? And then, okay, help me do it, and then, okay, help me write the code. And then, okay, this piece of code didn't work. Can you tell me why? Oh, and then code interpreter comes out. It's like, okay, this piece of code doesn't work, and it'll try it itself until it does, and then you just copy and paste it into your own environment. That's something that I've done that I literally had zero started from zero skill level on and was able to complete. So, like, when I talk about it being a reasoning engine and a sparring partner and ideating and all of that stuff, that's what I'm talking about.

I mean, not exactly that, but, you know, all of Reddit, all of open source, you know, book knowledge, all of the, all of these things, right? All of aura, and, you know, it's got a lot of knowledge in there that means some of it's really, really, really good and some of it's bad. So you're actually just taking it and you're kind of niching it down a little bit. And I mean, there's so many more advanced techniques like custom instructions, all this stuff like retrieval of your own information, all of that.

But I can tell you that when I was kind of thinking about kind of like a next project to spin up here, using chat GPT as your strategic advisor is amazing because it can start to give you, here's some ideas that you can go and pursue and then let's narrow it down. Let's elaborate on these things. Tell me what I need to do. Great. Now what I did then, actually, there's this embedded AI search within Google.

And their annual revenue is that. And then you can take all those answers, pump it right back into chat GBT, and say, all right, here's my competition. How do I differentiate?

I'm like, dude, what are you doing? He's like, I'm stuck on this bit of code. Like, similar kind of thing. It was like he was trying to build, like, some little roblox hobby game. He needed some code. The youtuber, like, the YouTube video he was watching was not 100% helpful. And so he went, like, he took the code from that the YouTube guy had posted, put it in chat GPT, and said, hey, make this work. And it made it work. I was like, oh, that's cool. So my intro to chat GPT was almost, like, using it as better Google. Before Google had their AI thing that I just talked about, it was just using it as better Google and. Okay, well, that's cool. Then I was using it as idea generator. Come up with ten possible names for this, come up with ten ideas for that. Come up with ten possible family vacations that we could do with a budget of $2,000. Right? Like, just give me lists. And that's what it was doing for a while. Then I started using it to plan out, like, social media. So I was running, you know, socials for the company. I was running at the time and I was like, I need ten tweets about this and I need a, you know, scripts that I would then put into, like, video AI generators to create AI videos. Like, just do my content for me. And then after that point, I was like, okay, this is like, giving me, like, pretty good stuff. It's been trained on my, my company, it's been trained on all this. Like, tell me what I should do with my company next. And that's actually what led to me, like, selling my first one. And then I was like, oh, like, okay, this was pretty cool. I'm starting from scratch. Let's start at day one with chat GPT and see where we can go with this. So it's been awesome. But, yeah, like, it started off with me and my ten year old using it as a better google to me, using it, basically, it's like, you know, I've hired, you know, air quote, hired a team of people via chat GPT to help me think through strategy and marketing and operations and things like that."

And because it's, it's just smart, like, and I think you're actually, some of the shit will scare you. Not gonna lie like it will. You're gonna be like, oh, once you know how to talk to it. And so, like, I think the other cheat code here, if you are a beginner with this stuff, is really thinking through the way you speak to it. And I would say that in the experiences I've had so far, the times I get great. The times I get great answers are the times I'm really thoughtful about my inputs, right. And the times I get meh answers is the times that I'm lazy about it. And I think of it, like, when I started noticing that it's really, I use the, I use the analogy earlier in the show chamber about, like, calling on someone who hasn't done their homework versus calling on somebody who has, right? And so, like, it's, the whole thing to me is treat it like you're talking to the smartest person you know. Meaning the communication has to be that way as well, in term. Not that it has to be fancy and, you know, high brow, but, like, you speak to, you should speak to it like you're talking to a person. Meaning if you give, like, let's put it this way, if I'm telling you something or I'm talking to you and trying to get an idea across, if I give you, if I am explaining it to you poorly, and then you go out and try to do the task I gave you, there's probably a disconnect and you're not going to like the result. I'm not going to like the result. I get back because I didn't properly explain something to you. Whereas if I gave you instructions that were super clear and asked you, do you understand this? Can you read it back to me? Uh, can you make sure, like, tell me what you, you know, took away from my instructions? We can be very clear on the task prior to you actually performing it. And I think that's super important. Like, treat it like you would a normal conversation. If you explain something poorly to your buddy, uh, they're not going to understand you or your wife. Uh, you. They're not going to understand you if you, if you."

He linked the 30 or the three minute video. The video says that. Hold on, let me read the exact disclaimer. It says, we've been testing the capabilities of Gemini, our new multimodal AI model. We've been capturing footage to test it on a wide, on a wide range of challenges, showing a series of images and asking it to reason about what it sees. Here are some of our favorite results. And so this video, this demo video with the duck took the entire Internet by storm that day. Everybody was, you know, floored. You got tweets like this from, you know, very well, wealthy, influential vc types and then it comes out later that this video was not how it was presented."

They put out their benchmarks, the Gemini ultra benchmarks, against chat GPT four. This is what, like, most of these models do when they come out. They want to do the similar tests and see how it stacks up to, like, 3.5, some of the open source models and GPT four. And nobody has really come close to GPT four levels yet. And what's crazy about that? I mean, like, think about what you're saying. What I. What I just said there. We're like, chat GBT has been out for over a year, right? It just had its birthday a couple of weeks ago. So, like, this model has been out for. Well, GPT four came out, what, January or February or something?"

And, like, obviously you would assume it's better than four, but nobody can even touch four yet. So, like, the lead that I feel like OpenAI has, which is why this, like, you know, CEO kerfuffle stuff was so impactful and detrimental. Right? Like you, they had such. They have such a huge lead, and, like, that's literally the only thing they could do to fumble the bag and they're doing it, you know? But, like, I. These benchmarks, like, if you look at this tweet with the benchmarks, right? So they do, you know, general reasoning. And, you know, the description of their general reasoning is representation of questions in a 57 subjects including stem, humanities, other things. And it. They say gemini ultra beats it by 4%. Now, the crazy thing on that is if you look at that a little closer, the chat GPT number says 86.4% on five shot. Do you see that? Five shot. Now, do you know what that means?"

So, uh, you know, just take everything you're being shown here in this video and all this stuff with a grain of salt, because, um, just even by their benchmarks, it's. It's very, very different.

I don't know what's going to happen with them, but there's a lot of reason to kind of, you know, take the Google grain of salt. However, one big difference that Gemini will have that the current version of GPT four does not have is it's built in, like, it's built natively multimodal. Do you know what that means?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, remember when you were using this, even just two months ago, you had to go and kind of select and drop down all those different models, right? If you want to research the Internet, you had to select a different model than if you wanted to use code interpreter, than if you wanted to use Dolly. And now they've, I assume through their own kind of like, function calling, they've been able to kind of duct tape these models together. However, you know, future versions are probably going to be multimodal from the start, right? So, like, that's the one thing right now that Gemini has as a potential advantage, right? Because, like you, if it's innately multimodal, you could think that video is possible at some point, right? Like that video you see is possible, but I mean, whatever the next version of GPT is, is going to be that as well. But, yeah, that's kind of the real quick TLDR of Gemini and what's been going on. There's also different versions of Gemini. Like there's this ultra, which is what they're touting here, which is, I guess, what they're saying is most comparable to GPT four. There's like pro, which is, I guess, closer to GPT 3.5. They are giving API access, actually, I think today was the day the 13th. But even the API access that they're giving, which they made a big deal about, is only for the pro model. So a little. Another little kind of somewhat deceptive thing there."
