We were able to execute and launch a new website here, bringing you guys some content for the NFT and crypto space. Djen.net work. That's my article there. Go take the, go take the how NFT are you? Test and see how many points you scored. So we're going to be tweeting stuff out here. We've got a ton of awesome content creators on board, bringing us articles about everything NFT, crypto, defi, all of our shows are going to live there. It's going to be pretty cool. We're going to have our own Twitch channel too where, so if you are actually saved, if you're not a writer, you want to produce some video content, hit me up. We will be looking for some people to do some content on our twitch as well. But yeah, we launched this today at noon. So we Chamber manned the ship getting this all built and stuff. So we did a, he did an awesome job getting this ready and it is live. So please check us out@dgen.net. work so that's my, that's my two minute bag pump for what we've been working on.

So, Ben, you are, you are involved in the community here at Chicken Derby. You're kind of in an advisor role. So tell us a little bit about. Oh, actually, that's a good question.

Those are the kind of things I see big longevity in. So I found this kind of early on and I ended up speaking with one of the co founders. And we just developed a pretty quick relationship. We had almost 3 hours of phone calls in the first day and a half of introducing ourselves to each other. And so it was a pretty quick relationship and it's grown from there. And each step of the way, it's been great to see, you know, from the beginning and then seeing what the end product looks like. I think everyone's going to be really excited."

So it's going to be a little over 13,000 dropping. And what's dropping is the NFT of the chickens themselves. So it's a pretty standard generative drop. The blind mint. Where there's different rarities, there's different traits, there's different circumstances of value that you'll be able to find in randomization, but also you have the Zed like racing atmosphere around it. So you're not just getting the color of something, but you're getting traits around it. And eventually you'll be able to customize them. You'll be able to name these as well. So you can name the first ones that you get in the drop. And so there's a lot of exciting things happening around it. But if you look at the roadmap on that website, you'll see after the NFT drops themselves, that's when the game and the phases of the different gaming aspects start being released."

And they said it could be, you know, on the earlier side, but they'd rather not, you know, over time, under deliver, but, yeah. So each phase, they're giving about two to three months buffer between them. So you're gonna have an alpha phase, you're gonna have a beta. They're gonna release breeding and customization, and there's gonna be a whole metaverse application to it. So there's a lot of longevity to this."

But I think the best thing for us to do is probably just go right to that written tutorial and they've laid out everything that you need to know for the most part about the NFT and the game and the drop."

But I will say anyone who's doing a gamification of their NFT has some real, I mean, has some real power in the space right now because that is just such a untapped, I mean you see what Axie's doing but there's, there's some mid levels and it's just. Yeah, utility. I think we're going to go through a next wave of utility and gamification is definitely going to be part of it. I.

So the heritage is. You can kind of consider bloodlines a little bit of. So the serama would be like a Nakamoto all the way down a buterin. So that's. That's the way that you can understand it. The serama is more rare sultan and is each more common down the line as you go. But the difference in this would be you're buying into a random mint, so you don't know what you're getting. You're not going into a drop looking for something specifically to purchase it. This is going to be randomized traits. Rare breed, sorry, heritages, all that. So you have the four here, from the most rare and strongest performers down to the most common and worst performers. And there's four of them."

So if we're looking at Zed run as you know, your nakamoto's are the most pure. And then as you breathe down, it gets less and less. Almost like that mutation.

So, honestly, you could just keep scrolling, and it just gets more interesting with each scroll of the mouse. So if you look here, there's sections. Talent, terrain preference, consistency. So, terrain preference is important. You have dirt, grass, road, rock, sand, snow, and track. And there's preferences for these chickens that they have inherent within them. So discovering. They said discovering your chicken's preference can lead to more consistent winds, similar to the way that Zed has it for distances. Right now, the first thing that they have introduced is terrain."

So you have 100 meters all the way up to 200 meters, and there's six of those. So your chicken, you also can figure out which of those distances and terrain combinations are going to be best. And then the pecking order is your class system. So there's a pecking order, which is your classes, and pecking order points, which are your class points. So the way that it works is each chicken starts out with a certain amount of pecking order points. And as you win, you gain points. As you lose, you lose points, and you stay within class systems. And so they do have the chick, which is the unraced class, which you do, which is kind of like your Griffin races. And then you're put into a class, and then you move up or down within them. And I'm sure over time, a, B, and C will probably not be enough, and they'll be hearing all kinds of suggestions on how to approach it. But, you know, we're really looking forward to seeing, you know, what people think about this, what they say, how they think to approach it. Uh, it's very interesting."

So each chicken gets one talent. So that's randomized. So you don't know what your chickens talent is until it's revealed in the metadata upon the purchase. And, yeah, there's going to be animations to it, but the randomization is also in what talents are used by which chickens in a race. So in a race, there's eight chickens, but not all of them are gonna be able to use their talents in every race."

I don't know, fatigue is the best word to use for talents, but, like, if you race your chicken a bunch of times, you're. You're not gonna get a talent every time you race, but your talent may come out every few races. So over time, you know, it should even out, per se. And that's the way that I'm thinking about it."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "This is. This is a question you probably don't know the answer to, but speculatively. So, then, would it be possible, or would it be safe to say if you have one of the better rarity, like, I forget what the most rare heritage was? What is it? Is it safe to say that a sarama may be able to, in a randomization of a race, use talents more frequently than one of the lower style heritages? Would you think that is something that would happen, or is it completely random?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Well, one of the things that they wanted to make sure of is that the gamification is fun and entertaining, and there's going to be nothing fun and entertaining about getting your ass beat every single race. Right. So they have a class system that's going to help distribute among the different, you know, not just rarities, but performance. And so, while a sarama is much better than a dorking, on any given day, you know, you can have the randomization or the. I guess the variance is a better word that anyone can win on any given day, but over time, it should even out that the better will beat the worse. And so they say that in there that, yeah, you know, the better or more rare heritage is with the better traits and the better talent all that lined up, you should win the majority of the time. But then you start facing other chickens in your class that have similar types of rarities and talents and stuff. So the idea is that it's fun, entertaining and balanced. And, you know, they're, they're very open to suggestions and I don't know. I'm not a game developer. How long it takes to implement fixes and bugs. And maybe if something's one way, how to make it another way without breaking things. I don't know how long these things take."

        "text": "I think it would be unethical if I knew the answer to that, but what I would say is, as far as I'm concerned, all of this shit is being randomized. So we're dropping, you're getting a blind mint of the random heritage, the random trait, the random talent. And like, you get what you get. You know, you have your PowerPoints and everything, but then you race, you figure out what's the best terrain, what's the best distance. You're not going to be able to change your talent, but I've brought up this suggestion to them over time that maybe they should have more than one slot for talents, or maybe you should have the ability to buy and sell or barter and trade your talents, like as a, as a. Almost a wearable kind of. So there's a lot of potential here, but they have a rough roadmap that they've showed you. They've done this stuff before. And along the way, if people have suggestions to provide to them, you'll have plenty of opportunities. And after this drop, they're going to be a lot more out in the open and talking and doing Ama's and stuff like that. But they want to make sure this goes smoothly. They're doing testing up until the last minute. And if you wanted to see one of the founders of Chicken Derby, we did an episode with crypto Poppy a few weeks ago."

But beforehand, like you can't just transfer over .033 from ETH to Polygon because you're paying gas fees and you might end up not having enough. Definitely fill the order and then you can't buy it and then you have to wait longer and then you're done. So I would say start as soon as possible. Make sure you have enough over there to, to project using a maybe 70 to 100 gas gui. You know, I would just say like, that's probably where I'll be at. You know, that's higher than normal when starting. But I, in my first grouping of whatever the max transaction number is, I usually try to just hit high gas right away because high gas early on, you know, fast gas, advanced gas early on is a lot cheaper than slow gas later on."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "That's the tip that I like to use. I like to go. And you don't have to use 300 gui early on either. I usually like to go like 20 or 30 above whatever the average to fast gap is. So I would say make sure you have enough for the gas fees to transfer your wheat, your eth to polygon. And then once you have it in there, you're pretty much good to go. Right. So you just need to be around for the drop time. Be on the website, make sure you understand how to use your metamask when it comes to connecting your wallet. And really for the most part it comes down to just clicking connect wallet. So we've run a bunch of tests on these. You know, as Des knows, when, when you're doing one of these projects, you like to have testing to make sure the minting can go through. So we've done those and I've seen, you know, random kinds of chickens that would be in a test set. And, you know, it's really cool to see the way they come out. So I'm super excited. I think really, really everyone's going to be excited about this being an NFT in general, right. This still is a blind mint. And there's, there's almost two thirds left of the supply of traits that are going to be randomized. There's going to be a lot of speculation on what else is coming, what are the combinations going to be, you know, so there's going to be strategy and community engagement all the way leading up to the game. So there's going to be multiple drops and within each drop there's going to be more demand generating as well. So each drop is going to be significantly more difficult to get into. So your best chance is getting in now and then hoping that the secondary falls. Right. That's. You don't want to speculate on that. That's very difficult to do because something like this can fly. And you got to be careful. At a price of 0.033, these things can get up to 0.1 by the end of the day. Easy. I'm not projecting that."

And knowing that Des kind of just went through this and you guys were involved in being in that drop. When it comes to, like, gas wars, do you think it's better for a project to limit the amount of transactions or nfts per transaction or to raise it higher than, like, what we've typically seen?"

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "For sure. We had to, we had to weigh those options. It's, it's for sure a balance. Right. Because if you go too high, you know, then you're just gonna, you're gonna absolutely kill your ability to get out to more individual holders of your NFT. So it's a balance. I think bulls was trying to be innovative and did the ten max because they wanted more individual holders. But at that point, and I brought this up yesterday or two days ago on the limited edition, is you basically just doubled your transaction volume because people that want 20 bowls are, are now going to have to submit two transactions for that. And if you did it 20, then that's half the transactions. And when you're talking about multiplying the number of transactions, that makes a huge difference. So that's why we decided to stick with 20. We thought 40 was too much, so that's what we did. That's just one factor of gas. You can't control all the other things. I mean, you look at what really drives gas, honestly, a huge portion of it is how much is being swapped on uniswap at that given time rather than just let's say, you know, how many nfts are dropping. So there is a little bit of randomization in there. We looked at time windows. Time windows don't actually have that big of a factor into gas costs."

It's something that I'm curious about as well, and I think it will have to do with what the mechanics end up being for that customization. So if there is a burn mechanic like in the forging, then I'm sure there will be. If it's, you know, something like ethlings where all you have to do is just swap and, you know, buy and sell, but the. The amount in the pool is, you know, cemented at whatever it is. I'm not really sure yet. That's a. But again, great question.
