And, you know, with these types of projects, you need to try to create some partnerships, and it's very hard to do as a community takeover because it means that you kind of have to use the supply that you've collected, and that requires you to trust certain individuals, and those individuals are sometimes bad actors. So these giant red candles that you see on our chart here are the results of said actors doing bad and not living up to their promises and instead market dumping their entire supply. So that's where you see on the chart, community rallied. When was it? Friday, Saturday, Sunday? Nightish. And we're just kind of chilling back where we started last week on what's today? The. Basically at the beginning of the month, May 1, we're back to where we were. So that's the mic minute. So we've had more just tomfoolery, ballyhoo antics. Community takeovers.

Basically, it's like, um, I don't think it's counterproductive to it, but I just wanted to say, like, my thoughts on it were, it was the genesis of a lot of, a lot of people getting into that culture, but it wasn't a good culture to base an entire ecosystem's innovation on. And so while we might have more people coming in to be potentially adopted, we have to put forward good shit in order to keep them here.

I'm just going to add to it my daily, like, brain exercise off of making money out of this and being part of something that's like, not Salesforce because I hated working with Salesforce. And so I think overall, like, you're not going to have the right people doing it by and large, because most people aren't the right people. That's why they're the right people. But I think overall, like, there's definitely an appetite once you get in to something where you're part of it. And you can make money out of it. Like, you see number go up. You're like, how else can I do this? Well, crypto is crazy. I don't know, why don't I just go figure something out about them? I have a weird cousin. I'm going to text him.

I mean, he didn't put anything in this tweet about it, but this is true insider lore about this piece of OSF artwork. He actually created this piece of art for me back in 2021.

And so we, myself and Morgane had to source artists in the space to recreate each one of these pieces of work that was stolen. And so OSF was actually going to be part of this project. This is the piece he did. It was never released because the project was never released. So it was really cool to see him tweet this this morning because it is a, you know, two or three year old piece of artwork from him that had never seen the light of day, to my knowledge, which is pretty cool. So there's some. There's some lore there for you that nobody knew, and that is exclusive to this podcast. How about that?"

So I had a couple thousand shares, sold it. I want to say it was a $2 at the time because they had a reverse stock split, I think. So I doubled up on it, thought I was, you know, doing great. So obviously, if I held onto that, I would have been sitting pretty. That's one, two. I split that investment I put into Cardano and to matic, doubled up on both of those. Also sold those, I think. I think Cardano was at maybede $0.05, got out at like $0.20 or 15 ish, maybe. So then I had like, eh, good, nice chunk of change. And then I shorted Tesla for the next four months and lost it all. So, yeah, so that's. That's. That's my. My story of AMC. And also you can see, too, ii Gme and AMC. I sold all of what I had left, which was a lot for my beautiful project.
