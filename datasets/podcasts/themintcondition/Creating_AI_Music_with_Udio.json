But, yeah, Chris, you know, we are far past the 69 420 market cap, but we are right around where we're going to play round two of 169 420 market cap. So we're literally at 173.2 right now.

And then it literally gives you kind of like a little prompt. This one right now, it says a song about the heartache of a good goodbye is what it's currently giving me. You can literally plug in anything you want and then it gives you prompts for styles of music. So, you know, hip hop or rock or indie folk. You know what I mean? Like anything you want. And you can add. You can stack types of music on types of music. So I'm like, oh, let me, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I'm a sucker for dreampop, which is dream pop.

How. How exactly for that one specifically? I wrote the lyrics, and it was. It was a minute long with a minute's worth of lyrics.
