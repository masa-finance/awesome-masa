I've seen many, many iterations of the ebb from bunch, so I think we'll be okay. But I need a catch up week. I've been. I haven't been on Twitter. I was in a little bit of a period of mourning with the Lakers last week, just unplugged. I had a. This weekend, I had a memorial service for my father in law. He had passed away back in January. So we finally. I don't know if anybody else has to deal with this, but my in laws live fairly close to me. Maybe about an hour, hour and a half away. But their, like, plots, like, where they want to be buried is like 7 hours from my house. Like, I don't like no rhyme or reason. So I had to travel basically to northern Vermont, but, you know, just across the border into Canada. And I was there all weekend, but I got back yesterday. I'm feeling refreshed, you know, swam and swam in a pool. It was hot weather. It's like 86 degrees here today. It's hot. It's hot for May."

The big weekend, you know, it's her dad. So she was obviously a little bit, you know, emotionally drained. So she went to bed early last night. I couldn't watch the series finale of succession, which was upsetting. I didn't hold it against her. I'm not a monster. But we did. We did watch it first thing this morning.

So feel free to come up if you guys want to talk about succession. That was great. But I have no idea what's happening in NFTs right now, or crypto, for that matter. I just looked at the chart this morning, and it looked like we saw a little bit of a pump on Ethereum, and I'm assuming, and bitcoin as well, seeing a little rejection at 28,000, roughly. I think we got up to about 28 five. Now back underneath, 28, uh, 28k on bitcoin. Um. Um, I don't know. We're just kind of hanging around in the. In the chop at Ethereum right now at about $1900.

Um, so we're right around 1900 right now. So I could see, like, a move up. But, I mean, these, this type of movement is not for. Oh, should I buy a bunch of Ethereum right now or should I sell a bunch of a theorem right now? This, this range here, I mean, this is for people that day trade, uh, Ethereum. Right? Like, you're either going to be long. You know, I could see some people taking some, some long positions last week that probably paid out fairly well. And I think we're kind of in no man's land. And then if it gets up to that 21, 2200, I could see some shorts being taken out again, just for the short term. But I don't think these prices necessarily should weigh any decisions, whether it comes to long term price action for either bitcoin or ethereum. I think this is just last week was probably, if you wanted to fool around, was probably a good place to get long, but the margins are super thin still."

I think that's cool. I think it's unique, and there is some value in doing that on bitcoin, which almost inarguably is the most decentralized, most secure blockchain. Do I think that it warrants some of these valuations that we've seen and all of the speculation in the many bitcoin that have traded on them? No, I don't think so. I think similarly to the 2021 bull run of ETH NFTs, most of them are going to be worthless. You know, just rubbish in your wallet. That said, like, some of them, are some of them likely to maintain value? Sure. And so in that, I see why people are, you know, having fun and speculating on them."

So it is better emphasis on the ER. Not great, but better. But yeah. To me, some of the coolest parts about it are to the purists that are like, oh, this wasn't what bitcoin was intended for. And it's like, well, you made this decentralized, permissionless, sensor resistant technology, and then by virtue of that, you have these secondary effects where you have people willing to bribe and pay.

        "text": "Well, so just for some context, the draft of that white paper was well beyond 100 pages. That was trimmed, trimmed, trimmed down. But it is a very technical, very dense paper, because it's answering a lot of questions in and around how you address a lot of these problems in gaming on chain. And so it's a simple solution to a lot of nuanced and complex problems. And one of the more difficult is like, okay, so we, as Pixel Vault, wanted to put out our game. Most games in web three are web two based games, leveraging web three assets where the entire game state, the game itself, is hosted on a server. And the only thing existing on chain is the assets that may or may not be being used as like just token gates. Hardly ever are they used actually in the game. There's another level of that where the assets themselves are represented in the game, which is great, but most of the activity is done off chain. Then there's full on chain gaming, where everything you do is on chain. Most often this is happening on Solana or some l two s just because of TPS transaction cost. All of those things stack up very quickly. We are trying to address a number of those factors, incorporating like skill based matchmaking on chain, on chain, skill rating on chain wager systems, and being able to level games of skill on top of that. Incorporating the NFTs to drive practical application and utility to these on chain assets, ideally driving value back to those token holders. And so, this is very different than the traditional connotation of like play to earn, where like, the closest analogy I seem to have found is a lot of people comparing it to the magic ecosystem. But a lot of the magic ecosystem is kind of show up, put in your punch card, do your on chain check in for the day, and roll the dice on the tokens that you're going to earn with the intention of offloading them. This is not those similar kind of grind mechanics. There are incentives built into driving people to be compelled to play. But it's that on chain transfer of value, and it actually being deterministic on your this game of skill to then participate in, like using the arcade analogy, you like put the quarter in, you play a game of skill based on that game of skill, you get tickets out, you take those tickets to like, the prize cage and spend it on in game rewards, which in this case happen to be nfts. And through that, there's like all of these on chain mechanisms where there's collateral, everything in the ecosystem is collateralized. So when you're spending those tickets, most of that value is actually going in as collateral within those nfts that can then be either converted, transformed, or burned to claim the underlying collateral or transform them into other goodies within other ecosystems. It's really focusing on this idea of composability rather than interoperability. Instead of using one asset across many places, you can use many, like the collateral within one asset to port it into many different ecosystems. And it's building a bigger arcade with a lot more games in it, rather than a bunch of stores right next to each other that don't use the same currency with only one game in them."

It will be a product of the community only answering to the token holders of which pixel Vault will be one contributor. There will be others. We will simply be the first to launch on it with battle plan. So, yeah, truly putting it out on a decentralized footing from day one. And the idea that this was a problem that we experienced as a company and I, you know, that there was. We saw that there are a lot of other ecosystems, a lot of other projects in web three that aspire to or like, want to provide their token holders some kind of utility or experience, gaming experience. And this was an avenue where traditional web two gaming companies can kind of plug and play, have all of, like, have reboot, handle all of the economics, the kind of ecosystem in a box, and all of the minting for them. All the marketplace, all of the skill based matchmaking, ranking systems, all of that. And web three based games can leverage it to have some kind of actual sustainable, recurring revenue rather than having to print l one nfts perpetually every quarter or two in order to maintain, you know, running.

There were projects that would run off with, you know, hundreds of eth in rugs and just fade into obscurity, and pixel vault would be, like, referred in, you know, time and time again. It's. It's like, why is it looked at as this fall from grace and sort of some of these things? And it's not out of, like, we've got 40 plus employees that. Most of which were hired from the community, all well intentioned, all trying to build and aspire towards building something great for these holders. And it's because Pixel vault just refuses to fucking die. And that, like, it's not going to fade into obscurity. It's going to stay lingering somewhere between front and back of mind. And I think that's why it just became an easy punching bag for a while. Because, like, instead of, like, naming one of the many hundreds or thousands of rugs that just ran off with your eth and left you with litter in your wallethood, you know, pixel vault was that one that just refuses to ride off into the sunset or be put down. So I'm really looking forward to not only the game, because I'm a gamer. I think the game's gonna be cool, but I'm also a big technologist, kind of in it for the tech guy. And I think reboot's doing some pretty novel shit on chain that otherwise, you know, it's been attempted in many different fashions, you know, in pieces. But to my knowledge, this is one of the first big cracks. And to be fair, like, we are taking a pretty big swing. Not trying to downplay that at all, but, like, it is pretty outstanding. Like, the amount of tech and amount of activity done on chain, like, even down to the referral rewards. Like, the fact that validators paid off, like, per per game session, affiliate rewards paid out per commitment. All of this being immutably done on chain is something that I don't think I've seen encompassed in a single package before."
