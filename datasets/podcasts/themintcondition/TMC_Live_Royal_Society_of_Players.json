It does talk about there's some provisions or some restrictions, right. So we can allow for the natural secondary market to develop. We won't be interfering with that, you know, for the foreseeable future. But, yeah, I'm actually going to throw out that I'm going to be giving away one of, you know, Royal Society players. Fantastic card, you know, for whoever is listening. So that'll be one of the giveaways today."

        "text": "I was going to say that really when this idea was presented to me by ZK 85, who I had originally met through NBA top shot. And then we talked a lot within the Zed run ecosystem. He actually started an NFT investors club discord that I was invited to. So we got to connect more through there. Well, first off, this was the only person since I've been in NFTs who has ever asked me for my LinkedIn. I was taken aback, little caught off guard. I was like, whoa, we don't do that here. But when you find out who EPA 85 is, he is the co founder of Landmark Ventures in New York City. They host over 400 events a year. This is all public information at this point. And landmark will be supporting the overall trajectory and growth of Royal Society of players. So basically what it is, 10,000 playing cards, 192 decks with 16 jokers, which, of course, will be the most rare. There will be some different rarity traits that I can't really dive into too much because we purposely did not allow for our metadata to leak at all today. Just really trying to just keep the integrity and the fairness and equality for this project, but really, right, so you have playing cards and you have the unique gamification that is allowed for with playing cards. Right. It's something that most everyone's familiar with. They've either played poker, you know, blackjack, even go fish. Right. And so, unlike a lot of the avatar projects that we've seen, which have had layers of controversy when it comes to inclusion, gender representation, racial representation, whatever it may be, we tried to go a little bit different of a direction as far as we don't want to be your avatar, maybe we want to be like your Twitter banner or your cover photo or something like that, but we want this to be something where all the different avatar communities can feel represented, feel like they have equal opportunity and inclusion. So you have the gamification of the playing cards and what is this all like? What's the incentive? Right. What's motivating about this? Well, the gamification of these playing cards, as well as just holding on to at least one of them, which is your access, your digital membership into the Royal Society of players. What that's going to allow for is both in real world experiences, events and opportunities, as well as metaverse experiences, events, rewards, privileges, giveaways, etcetera. So one of the initiatives as far as the giveaways that will be done is there will be ticket packages to basically every major and college sporting event that, you know, any regular season game for the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball, NHL, european soccer, college basketball, college football, you know, you name it, right? A wild card game of your choice. Regardless of what sport, these are all just unique giveaway opportunities that are made possible through the digital membership or the digital access granted by holding on to at least one of these nfts. Then we take it a step further and we include a the metaverse elements, right? So there is Zed run horses that are going to be bred in, you know, one z three, legendary, which, for those who aren't familiar with Zed run is going to have the top Nakamoto Genesis blood within it is going to be given away once a month for the foreseeable future. I mean, that's just one example of the metaverse utility. There will be a Metaverse headquarters established, most likely in the sandbox platform."

        "text": "Definitely sharing their ideas. It seems like a lot of people are excited about, as Desa just said, the potential of this. And that's really what we're trying to do, is we are looking to create partnerships with the other avatar projects, with other metaverse opportunities, and really just try to make this as great of an experience as it can be and really establish an inclusive, just, you know, kind of next level, forward thinking community of people that share a vision of they want to interact and connect with people in the metaverse. But also, we don't want to forget that. Like, there's a whole world out there. Like, let's go enjoy it. Let's, you know, you don't have to, right. It's not required to be in the Royal Society to make yourself public. I know that there are some people that are a little bit more sensitive, little, maybe a little more high profile. They have families, they have jobs that they just don't want to mix with the NFT crypto community. And, you know, we respect that. So there will be ample opportunities as we show through some of the initiatives and giveaways that we've already held prior to mint that will allow for, you know, experiences and incentives regardless whether or not you're going to be actually attending the real world events."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Sure. I mean, and then, yeah, with the, with the real world events, too, is, I mean, as we've seen with things like v friends, right, that just can create an entire secondary market in and of itself. Right? So say you miss out tonight, but you know of an event that's happening near you and you want to get in there you go. You can go buy one on the secondary market, and now you might have access."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So what I thought was awesome about this, so I actually was able to meet ZK 85 this week at a gathering we were both at, and he was telling me all about it, and I just think, you know, now that the landmark ventures pieces is public info, the potential of all the things that you can do with tying these into real life events and giving. I mean, it's the. It's the word we always use on this show, but the utility of these is going to be amazing. The other thing that I think is really cool about this is, you know, like you said, ty, it's inclusive, but it's also. Everybody gets cards, right? Like, it's. It's something that everybody's familiar with. It resonates with so many of the people in, you know, that run in these spaces of crypto where it's, you know, either you came in from sports betting or gambling of some sort, or top shot, which is, you know, a real card type playing group or daily fantasy or things like that. So I think there's just a really great, um, you know, way that this resonates with. With people. And, um, you know, let's chamber. See if you could bring up, uh, maybe the website a little bit and we can walk through some of this, too, because I don't want to downplay what these actually look like themselves, too. Like. Like, these are. These are really dope looking cards and backgrounds and stuff. And so they were done by Oban Jones, uh, who is actually a famous artist that does playing card art. Right. Is that. Is that who."

        "text": "I'm an energy thought went into the design of the playing cards themselves. That was definitely something I had wanted to mention. So thank you for that, Joe. One other thing that I wanted to draw attention to was granted, a lot of us, I think all of us that are on this stream right now are within the USA. There's actually going to be ample opportunity for those that are international to feel included in this community as well. There's a community wallet being established that will have at least $100,000 in it that will go towards satellite events. If you're in Australia, and I know that there's a big Zed run crowd there, that the reason they got into Zed run was because they were big on real horse racing. Like Doofy, for example. Doofy, I know, was talking with his network about the Royal Society of players and his excitement. And so one thing that we would like to do is be able to have these satellite events where, say, Doofy and his friends can go to the real race track and their drinks are, you know, all on Royal Society for the afternoon or something. That's just one example. One other thing that I wanted to mention was, let's see, had the art, the."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. I mean, like I said, all hand designed, you know, every detail was really scrutinized as far as just trying to fit the personality of royal society, of players, which does go into the last thing I wanted to mention. This is not a frat house. This is not a gentleman's club. We want really everyone to feel included in this. Yes, there is a natural, I guess, like exclusivity. No, not exclusivity, but there's almost like a natural, like, movement towards poker because it's playing cards, or a natural towards sports, because we do have that initiative with all of the different, you know, professional sporting events that we're doing giveaways for. But we also want to be able to include, you know, concerts, Broadway shows, you know, other performances around the country or around the world, really. And then also trying to bring those opportunities to the metaverse as well. For those that either don't feel comfortable coming out in person, maybe they can't travel as easily. So we really want to do all we can to make these experiences bridge the real world in the metaverse."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, that's awesome. So stick on this area here, chamber, because this is kind of all the things that we've just talked about. Right. So, ty, walk us through just like, what the royal treasury is. You know, what are the details of that? And then maybe, you know, how that differs from the community wallet and maybe what the royal competitions might be. Some of these things that we haven't touched yet."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, of course. So the royal treasury is being established for a couple of different reasons. One, we want the ability to give back to the community through giveaways and raffles and just ways to keep it fresh, exciting, to allow for more people to get into the Royal Society of players, not necessarily through the secondary market, which not financial advice we are expecting, could increase quite a bit from the initial mint price. With that said, the royal treasury will offer the opportunity for people to still get in at the ground level, either through the giveaways or also through what ZK 85 is organizing with a second chance mint, we don't know, or drop raffle, whatever you want to call it. We don't know how many it's going to be. It's really going to be dependent on how the drop goes this afternoon as far as how many ZK 85 is able to collect himself, that can go towards that royal treasury. But there are, I believe, 150 of the playing card nfts. Again, blindmint random distribution are being set aside because there are already people that have won giveaways. There is a select few that are going to be distributed to the Royal Society lead team, such as myself and chance and PLT. So those are some familiar names in the NFT community as well. Kayla is the other Royal Society lead at the moment and she is directly from landmark. So we have that connection or that liaison as well. So that's the royal treasury. I think that's the best way to kind of sum that up. One other thing that I think is important to draw attention to is similar to some of the other avatar projects that we've seen, such as bored Ape Yacht Club. We don't want our community to be limited by the 10,000 nfts that are available because chances are, especially when we're talking about royal competitions and collecting, quote unquote hands of cards, whether it be poker or other gamification that we figure out, we don't expect that there's going to be 10,000 members of the Royal Society of players to start out, but who's to say that it eventually could not get to that point or be potentially even beyond that? So how that will become possible is through some sort of quote unquote breeding element, which really means that there will be an airdrop down the line for those that are holding on to, you know, the playing card. Nfts similar to what?"

Well, there are people that can step in and offer the same exact utility that he can offer, whereas I believe with v friends, you can't say the same thing. So, vfriends, very Gary centric, very Gary focused, whereas this is a little bit more community driven.

And the reason why is because ZK 85 is an authentic NFT enthusiast. He is a avid collector and investor and trader on a daily basis. So he understands everything that we do when it comes to what makes a successful drop, what could go wrong with a drop, how to price your nfts, how to distribute your nfts, why people are, what is going to incentivize people to actually want to collect your nfts, how to incorporate gamification, what is the incentive or what is the thrill of, you know, the inevitable metaverse. And these are all things that, yeah, he has a corporate background, but he genuinely understands these concepts. He connects with, you know, the NFT community on a personal level. And that is why it's ZK 85, the board ape, not Zeev Klein, the co founder of Landmark Ventures."

And that's, and that's a thing that puts this project on another level in my opinion, is having that backing of or having those capabilities just makes this kind of a next level type of utility that I think we can see. And then, you know, from my standpoint, you don't get to meet a lot of these founders of these projects. I've, you know, now I had the blessing to be able to meet Des. So I had some confidence going into goats because I knew who Des washing. I got a chance to meet ZK and super confident that this is going to be able to execute in the way that it's being presented. So from my confidence level, it's definitely got my seal of approval on this one. And that probably doesn't mean much to anybody, but it will means a lot to me, buddy. Cool. So, Tyler, before we get out of here, because I want to give you enough time to do what you need to do before the drop, but what are we missing here? What are any other questions in the chat that we can answer? Anything that you don't think we covered yet? What else do people need to know?"

        "text": "No? Not necessarily, though. I've never hashtagged ad. And the reason why is it's not necessary because I'm already, like, so forthcoming and transparent with any time I partner with an artist. Sure, I've already said this before, that, like, I don't just go out there and it's no slight against anyone who does. Like, hey, if it's, you know, able to help you make a respectable living and it's getting you ahead, and you're not doing anything really to damage the overall community, all the power to sue you, but, like, as long as we're being transparent about it, right? So that whole hash ad thing, I personally don't have a problem with it. It's just not my own approach. My approach is let me actually connect with the artists on a more personal level. Let me help them through their project or through their creative process. And when it comes to the whole logistics and structure of really establishing their presence in the NFT community. And I look to, you know, focus on community engagement. Yes, there's promotion and marketing that comes through social media posts and I twitter spaces and stuff like that. But I'm actively involved with the community. I'm dedicated to, you know, the project or the artist, and I do so, like, authentically. So I had a few different opportunities that I was working on, you know, Dario, NFDOs, Chicken Derby, a couple others. And I stepped back from all of them when I was approached with the opportunity for Royal Society of players. And the reason I did that was one quality of life. I just need to have some balance with my time, which Joe and I have talked about. But at the same time, it was Royal Society of players to me. No disrespect towards any of those other projects I just mentioned through what we've talked about today. It's something that I feel like will be around for years, if not decades, to come. And the reason why is it already has a proven track record through landmark ventures and I think it has a good model with something like a v friends. Another example that was brought up for the metaverse side of things is Metakey. And we see how that project has definitely increased in value since it initially, you know, debuted. But these are the reasons why. And I mean, and then ZK 85 specifically, having a lot of faith in him personally that he is emotionally invested in this. He's not looking to rug pull anyone. And I see him making this his passion project for, like I said, years, decades to come. So therefore, for all those reasons, that's why I made this my, pretty much my only focus, not even just my primary one, because I really do believe in this project, this utility and the community that we have established."

Great. One thing that we did not go over was there will be merchandise that will eventually be coming out. So there will be physical collectibles as well for people to invest in or to collect. That will be custom physical playing cards. The potential of poker chips, maybe some other more like wearable merchandise. Who knows? Maybe it'll turn into metaverse wearables. I don't want to promise anything. One other thing I don't want to promise, but I thought was a really clever idea that someone had presented to me last night at the event was what if there were either a few pop ups or even established like, you know, bar speakeasies, whatever type of environment you want it to be in the real world, where if you are a Royal Society player, you get free entry, you just show your card on your phone or whatever it is. I mean, that's the whole point of these NFTs with digital access, you know, gain a membership. But let's say you don't have one. Well, it's not that you're not invited.

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yes, that is. That was the inspiration for ZK 85, was the top shot challenges and thinking how we could transform those into something with, you know, playing cards, poker hands, things like that. One thing that is important to point out is that, again, we already said that these are all, like, pieces of fine art, you know, hand design professionally designed by an illustrious playing card artist. However, in addition to that, I think it's also important to mention that just because you get a two of diamonds or, you know, say you have two seven off suit in poker, that's the worst hand within the Royal Society of players. We already are, like, aware of that. We're taking that into consideration. And so we really are going to strive to have, like, all playing cards have similar value. Right? Like, granted, the jokers are always going to have the most value because they're the most rare. And if you have, you know, pocket aces, or say, you maybe even have, like, six aces, you're probably sitting in a pretty good spot down the line for when we do some sort of royal competition that involves face cards and aces. But there will also be royal competitions that involve what some would determine to be the lesser cards. So you may think when you get that, you know, two of diamonds, you know, let me just throw that on the floor and get my investment back. All the power to you. But we're just advising that we are understanding of that sentiment and we are going to challenge it."

And I think that's really attractive because you can hear basically on demand, all of these things that go down in basically real time, which I think is really cool.
