I love a cute puppy, even though the kitten's probably gonna kill me just with his allergies. Cats, I got no beef with them. Dogs, super loyal, love them. Just not my personal journey.

So we have this app that we use to message all the parents. So I just cancel practice. The next morning, I get an email from somebody from the league. I don't know. I don't know if it's the president of the league or whatever, but somebody from the league says, hey, just FYI, don't cancel practices due to heat. We don't want families thinking that games or tournaments will be canceled because of heat. Just tell them to bring extra water as a so on and so forth. I emailed them back and said, hey, listen, I'm not coaching a bunch of kids that are going to pass out because of heat exhaustion for a practice. I gave her the Allen Iverson, we talking about practice. And I basically said, hey, you guys were begging for coaches don't come at me in email saying, I can't cancel a goddamn practice because it's 100 degrees outside. You know, take a hike. So. Didn't get a response back the next game. So, like, whatever the next one was, there was a massive thunderstorm brewing. Like, you just every, like, you looked at the radar. Like, at the time we were playing, you knew it was going to be this massive thunderstorm, and they weren't canceling the game. And I didn't want to cancel it myself. Cause it was a game this time. So I said, well, I'm not bringing my kid because it's torrential downpours at this point. We're ten minutes from the game. I'm about to hop in my car and drive the five minutes to the field just to say I was there. But I'm like, there's nobody that's gonna show up. And sure enough, I start driving. I make my way there, and five minutes after we're supposed to, you know, we're supposed to start the game, they cancel it. And, like, literally nobody got out of their car. There's lightning everywhere. Like, just two, three inches of rain dropping in a span of like an hour and a half. I'm like. And then I called. I called this person up. I said, what? Like, what are we doing? Like, how are we not? I knew at 03:00 there was gonna be no games today yet. I have to wait till five. I have to get ready, do all this stuff like, what has happened? So I was at my wits end. On top of that, like, the games that we did play, like, half of my team shows up. We played last night again, I had to forfeit because only three kids showed up, including mine. It's just terrible. I want to quit. I don't know what to do. I don't know. That's where I'm at.
