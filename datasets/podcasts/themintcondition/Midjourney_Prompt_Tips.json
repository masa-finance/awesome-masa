And so I was going to take profits, as the kids say, although I'm not sure they're profits anymore. I think it's just like, take money out. But so went through this process that I was going to use some tokens that I had on, like, arbitrum or whatever. And I went through the process of, you know, bridging some ETH over for arbitrum gas, selling some tokens I had over there, like magic and the arbitrum token, sending it back to my wallet or going to sushi, swapping it back to ETh, sending it to my main wallet, and then sending it to Coinbase to cash out.

So, okay. Makes me feel better, right? So I'm like, okay, well, that's it. I'm good to go. I'll just wait and see. So more time passes and it still is not showing up in my balance. And I'm like, okay, what the hell? So I go back and do the same thing, and I actually click on this pending transaction here that I see, and it sends me into an absolute panic because now I still don't understand what is happening here or why it's happening, but I click on this transaction and says, received Ethereum five ETH $9,200.18. But then it says network arbitrum. And it says from Ethereum address, I view on my block explorer. And then I click on that and it takes me out to arbitrum block explorer. And so now I'm in a straight panic. Like I was, I was semi distracted when I did this, but I'm, I was pretty sure, like, I sent it from my metamask to, that was connected to main net. So I'm like, oh, and actually, maybe I wasn't, I don't know, maybe I was on, I guess I wasn't on main net. And so I think I sent it from the wrong or to the wrong type of Coinbase address. So now, I mean, I went straight to Coinbase customer service and she told me that everything is fine. She said it's a network congestion thing. And I'm like, okay. And that was about ten minutes ago, 15 minutes ago, right before the show. And so I'm sitting here like, all right. I literally said to her, I was like, let's see. I said, hmm, what did I say back to this lovely customer service representative that might have been AI? I said, so you're saying this will eventually process normally and I didn't do anything wrong. And she said, yes, you will just have to wait till the transaction is completed. I'm like, there's no way. I didn't do anything wrong here. Now that I'm looking at it, like, I definitely sent it from, like, from arbitrum to like, the ETH network and I did not do it properly. So I don't know what's going to happen.

And we, most people in this audience know what that is to look at, but the AI doesn't know what an album cover is, and it doesn't really need to know because you're generating artwork.

So, like, if you have, maybe you just put out some, or maybe you generate some really cool cannabis image, and then you blend it with the actual abbey road cover and see what it comes up with. The other would be using it as a reference image. So, like, when you do the imagine prompt, right, you've got your imagine, you can actually copy the link to the photo. So, like, open it in your browser or whatever so that you have a link to the image, and you use that as, like, the beginning of your prompt, and then you prompt."

So you'd save them to your phone, and you can actually blend up to, I think it's five images.

She actually went to my little anonymous Instagram where I was posting all my mid journey stuff, and she grabbed one of my creations, and she blew it up, put it on a canvas, and got it framed, and it's hanging in my basement.

Dots per inch, I believe is what that's for. A dpi above 300. And you'll be getting. You'll be extremely happy with your results. There are plenty of free ones out there. There's probably plenty of apps you could download for your iPhone or Android that could give you a simple two X upgrade. I would also say yes, gigapixel and Topaz, if you want to get, you know, four x, eight x, 16 x, you know, upscaling, those are your kind of go to options. I've played around with them.

So for that, it'd be like, you know, kind of. Yeah, joint smoking, others, it would just be like, I don't know.

I was that part or I was in that camp. Use a photo editor and start, you know, painting, splicing, layering in other images so you could generate an image of a joint or a cigarette. Add that to an image that you just created where they didn't have joints and cigarettes in it. I'm kind of a free maxi, so I don't use Photoshop. I use a program called Krita. K r I t A.

The reason why it works is David mentioned on a mid journey a while back that when they started training the model, they used some website and I got, I knew I should have bookmarked it, but about a couple of months ago, I actually found the website. It's really weird and it's got like an a to z of everything you could possibly imagine with the word core behind it. But it's like a, like a real good resource for like just doing weird stuff with my journey. So that was the answer. But the question, see, Neil, I said when we were talking to chamber about creating art that he was after, don't worry about album art cover, because in my mind is that the AI is not going to determine that. In fact, it's an album cover as opposed to a piece of art. So that, that was like kind of new to me. I wouldn't, if I was trying to create something like he was, I wouldn't use that."

I see a lot of horror stories from, like, Disney World and Disneyland about, a, the price of the food and versus the quality, a, the price is, like, insane, and then the quality is not that good either. They'll do, like, weird combinations of food that don't make any sense. But I would have to imagine on the cruise, the food is going to be significantly better than, like, going."

We'll do one after the weekend on Monday, and then we'll do a Friday show. And then. Then we'll have you back on Monday and you can tell us all. I cannot wait to hear all the tales from the sea."

We're still debating on that, but we will see. I'm very much looking forward to it. I am going parasailing at some point, I think so. We'll see if I survive that. That'll be fun. But that is going to do it for us. I will maybe send you some pictures from the high seas, replicate the Titanic picture. Hopefully I don't get thrown in the brig for doing something terrible, but that is going to do it for us. I will be out next week. Chamber is going to be doing Monday and Friday. Don't forget to catch coffee with Captain tomorrow. Oh, no, Monday. Gosh, we're on a Friday. Today's Friday. I keep thinking today's Wednesday. So coffee with Captain Monday. But night shift tonight at eleven. By the way, Chamber, did you you not catch the first episode of DJ and Bets yesterday?"
