So I don't really know what day of the week it is or whatever, but the days of the week that our podcast fell on just ended up kept being like, alternate Christmas one, alternate Christmas two. Alternate Christmas three. New Year's Day. Like, are we back today? I'm like, you can be, but I'm not. And so that happened, I don't know, at least twice. The one I felt really bad about was Friday.

Now it's two soul, ten soul. Now it's three soul, ten soul. Now it's one soul. So I would say smaller swings, more. A more shotgun approach, like a.

We're going to get a bunch of Ethereum people to come over and play in the soul ecosystem. My brain's like, well, this is obviously something to go heavy into. So not only did I get my airdrop, I decided to buy an additional bag. And, yeah, it just melted and melted and melted away and it crescendoed, which I'm sure we'll talk about later to the, you know, to the massive market drop that happened early this morning and then all of the majors.

So I think it's more of a cycle where things are profitable elsewhere and are cycling through other chains and other markets. So people are. And were making money. I just wasn't one of those people. We are on the. I think in the very beginnings of. I'm anticipating a pretty good airdrop season, and we've said in the past a lot, airdrops can create little mini seasons. What we really want is new entrants because that grows the pie. But airdrops create a certain liquidity in markets that can. That can. That can create some.

So literally it was like literal fake news that tanked the market. Like half a billion dollars or half a trillion dollars. I don't even know how much it was. It was a ton. Maybe it was half a trillion. Maybe it was $500 billion. I don't know. It was a lot, but yeah. And it's rebounded. We're back in, like, I'm just looking at the bitcoin chart right now. We're back in that same zone. We were between forty two k and forty three and a half k, where we were chopping basically all of December. So I don't know.

I'm interested to see what happens after approval, but I'm more 50 50 on what it's going to do to the price of bitcoin, especially in Q one. I am long term, obviously long term, bullish on the price of bitcoin, but q one price action, I'm really, I would have said down, but now I'm a bit more hesitant to say that."

Where I like to play around is, again, just more in low cap stuff. I don't. Because of, you know, I just explained how shitty I am at trading meme coins and how I've depleted my little. My bag of soul. I do not want to do that with bitcoin. So bitcoin and ethereum, those bags are just stuffed. I just don't play with them as much. I do have, obviously, altcoins on the Ethereum blockchain that I have positions in. But if I'm going to play around or gamble, because longing, bitcoin is definitely more on the gambling side or shorting or whatever. And I honestly just dont want to look at the charts all that much. Ive already lost probably seven years of my life looking at charts over the last two weeks. So I just dont want to do that with bitcoin. Im long term bullish. What im doing with bitcoin right now and with Ethereum is as we navigate this cycle and if and when we reach new all time highs, Im in the camp that we will see new all time highs. I have a number in my mind for bitcoin specifically. And once we are at the, what I think is the top of that bull market, that super euphoria, there's new entrants in. We grow the overall crypto market, total market size, dollar size, to multiple trillion dozen tens and tens of trillions of cryptocurrency liquidity. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take that bitcoin and take that ethereum and a good chunk of it I'm going to put into a USDC or a tether and then wait for that major pullback. So that's the, when I do stuff with bitcoin or with ethereum, it's usually that, it's like, okay, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna trade on the way up. I'm gonna wait till I think it's the very top. I'm gonna take a pretty good sized position out, put it into a stable coin, and wait for it to drop to a price point that I like. In theory. In theory, that's what I'm gonna do."

But it is definitely a learning, there's a learning curve to it, but that's how I trade the big caps. So like a theorem and bitcoin, it's have my position, wait till I think it's the very, you know, you're in price discovery, and then at a certain point where the euphoria is at a fever pitch, let's take a good chunk off of the table, put that into a stable coin, wait for that major pullback and rebuy and do it all over again."

        "speaker": "A",

It's been legitimized over the last ten plus years now. So there are trillions of dollars in cryptocurrency right now. That's big. That's a big number. I don't know what the current market cap for bitcoin is. I'll tell you that right now. Just under a trillion just for bitcoin. So 838 billion market cap. That's huge. That's massive. So it's a legitimate place for big money to trade. So I do think it's going to get approved. I don't know what that timeframe is going to look like. It seems like it's going to be in January at some point, but that could change. But as far as where I think we're going to see price discovery for bitcoin. Personally, I don't think that's happening until Q four of 2024, I think. I was listening to Ledger's show and they were saying the all time high for bitcoin has always been, I think they said 200 days or 200 some odd days after the having was the new all time high, which I think currently the halving is set for April of this year. So 200 days after that would be, I think, like Q one of 2025. But I still think December 2024 seems pretty solid as well. So that's where my, somewhere I would say between November, December and then maybe Q one of 2025, I think, is where we see that new all time high price discovery action."

Maybe we see like $52,000 bitcoin pull back to 47 in q three and then maybe, and then again we'll see that rebound into q four. And then we start seeing all time highs in q four.

Also, J. Webb, speaking of degenerate gambling, if you're looking for bunches tennis bets, join our discord. I did bet on tennis today, a lot of it. So there you go. I mean, my degeneracy is just as strong as yours. However, I'm playing games. I think I have an edge in your holding your peen and that's going to do it for us. Until next time, keep the mic hot."
