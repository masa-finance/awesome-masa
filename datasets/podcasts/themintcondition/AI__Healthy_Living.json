I was going to ask you something else here. But we have some hands, so I'll go around to those. But just a update on the fitness goals in the d gen war room, we've got cap, who, after a slow start, has now committed to doing an entire 420 miles in a single month. So, for those not who don't know, we're doing the 420 miles summer challenge."

        "text": "Yes. And I just put it, I just pinned it up top, if you haven't seen it. So essentially the TLDR of this is, you know, they put, first of all, the tweet went nuts. It's got 1.2 million views, almost a thousand retweets, 751 quote tweets, 22, 50 bookmarks. It's crazy. If you haven't seen this tweet thread, check it out. Regardless of if the actual company and all this stuff is real or not, the idea is, the idea is very real and it's coming and it's going to happen. Right. There's some really interesting things that they talk about in this tweet specifically that, you know, are already, that they're demonstrating with this, you know, South park thing, but that are already being done, which is, you know, des, to your point, it's like, it doesn't matter if the actual South park part is fake or not, right? It's, it's like they're citing things that are already being done. And the whole idea is announcing generative tv and showrunner agents, right. And the idea is that they're building, basically world building, that you're going to be able to kind of generate content on demand, specifically with things like existing ip. So this example is using South park, but fable studio exists. There's a real GitHub here that exists. And they talk and they cite the Stanford paper in that second or third tweet there that if you haven't seen that Stanford paper on AI agents, they put these AI agents in a game simulation and they let them kind of generate their own interactions with each other and just observed how they acted in this environment. And it was really, really cool to see what the results were. It was like you had these characters that were, it's like if you were playing the Sims, but everything was AI generated. Right, where you had, you know, some of the characters were planning a party, two of the characters fell in love and whatever. And this was like, all autonomously generated through these AI agents that were acting on their, you know, like, character prompts. And so the whole idea of this paper or this tweet was that they were doing something similar with these South park episodes and talks about the Truman. We want you to be able to watch the lives of AI's and simulation, like reality tv for AI. This is where they cite the Truman show, and it's kind of all possible, right? So you're basically building these containers, giving these AI agents personalities via prompt, and then just kind of like letting them generate interaction, which is so mind blowing when you actually think about it. And it. I don't know, des, if you watched Black Mirror, that. That I did the Joan is awful. It reminded me a lot of that. Totally haven't seen the Joan is awful Black Mirror episode, which was in the six, season six episode one that just came out. Like this is. It's basically this, right. It's. It's the same. Similar concept wherever I. You're really all in a simulation. It talks about Westworld and then it gives, like, these examples of what they were able to generate. And, you know, this is definitely where we're heading because you can really already do this, like with the Stanford paper and stuff. It shows it's possible. So, like, there's really interesting applications. Obviously, Anthony, like you said, like, in this example, Hollywood flipping out, they're obviously all in the middle of a strike, as is both screen Actors Guild and the writers guild. And like, this obviously is kind of scary when you think of the context of that. But really, like, I could apply, I could see this applying really, really, really well in like, video games, right, where you've got, you know, the experience of NPC's and video games has never been really that great. And now imagine a setting like this or something like this in like GTA, right, where your. Your character blows up the hospital, and now the entire city that you're interacting with knows the context of you blowing up the hospital. That wasn't part of a mission. It's just something you did in the world. They have that context. They can interact with each other around it and yourself and all that stuff, and they have their own kind of autonomous lives. It's kind of really weird and meta to think about, but, yeah, I think it's kind of already here and it's just going to get more and more possible. What's your take on it?"

I've talked to folks that I'm like, oh, how do you think this can be used in tandem with, like, blockchain? And imagine if you had, like, this entire kind of autonomous board of directors for a Dao, and, like, each one of them was a check and balance, and they were governed by smart contract. Everything they had to do was that. But the way they made decisions was all these kind of, like, autonomous checks and balances of each other. Like, there's so many crazy applications. Once you really extrapolate, like, the idea out of it, it's fascinating. Like, this is the stuff that I'm super obsessed with at the moment of what all the possibilities are and stuff like that. So, yeah, I saw this last night. And again, whether or not the actual generate, like, south park part of it is real or not, the. The concept is very real. The technology there that they're talking about is very real. And so it's coming. So, you know, it's probably enough to make the majority of people very uncomfortable. What's your take on it? Like, are you. Is this something that excites you? Is it something that scares the shit out of you? What. What do you think?"

        "text": "Uh, yes. No, it excites me. I. We were talking about it earlier on Circles podcast. I mean, uh, on spaces. Um, that, uh, you know, like, for NFT communities, it'd be amazing. I'd use our treasury. I'd pay $10,000 to upload all my goats, all the information that we've taken from tally labs and character creation, uploaded it to one database, and let them create content and shows with. With the art that currently exists within our community. And it's not. I mean, that's not too far fetched. So I don't know. I think. I think it'd be really cool. You know, we talked about the example of, like, pudgy penguins is, like, a perfect example of a project that would use it because they already have very family friendly ip that you can create, like, cartoon animations that's geared to like kid content and children content learning based. It's just like it's, and it puts the power to create that level of content in people's hands that normally wouldn't have the creative chops to do it. And I think it, you know, overall it's pretty exciting."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, super interesting. Like, I think the, the avenue you just went down with like how this could amp up existing web three projects, like, you know, we always talk about how hard it is to actually like build iP. This would put it on like a supercharged that ability, right. And then it's about building, and then it's about building the biggest community you possibly can because the, the cost and the cost and time to produce, you know, content becomes close to zero right, over time. And that's interesting. So, yeah, chamber, what do you think about this? Had you seen this prior?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, my concern would just be just like, kind of like what you said, right? Like with the writer strike, with the actor strike supporting them. I just hope they can, they're taking that. They're a, they're aware, I'm sure they are aware of the things that could be coming in the relatively near future. I hope they take measures to either protect themselves or equip themselves with it in those negotiations just because if they don't, obviously it's, you know, they didn't in the last one. So the last writers strike was back in like, oh. 05:06 streaming services weren't even in the, you know, it wasn't even up the road. It was down the road a bunch. I think we're still a good ten years away from solid streaming services and they didn't take that into consideration. And now they're getting their lunch eaten when it comes to residuals and stuff like that, I hope they take, take that experience and hopefully frame it within the AI's, you know, within AI ability to protect themselves or at least use, have themselves supported to take advantage of it. So it gives them the ability to make money and not lose money to the, you know, to the big corporations that are the big studios that are running Hollywood. So that's my fear, because, you know, some people may like it, some people may hate it, but like, the writers strike last time was a direct, you know, a direct result of the writers strike last time was the shitty, you know, five plus years of really hard reality tv. And I know it created a whole new sub genre of television, but it's the absolute worst. And I know some people really like it, but I just don't want any more. I don't want shitty AI tv, do you know what I'm saying? To be what we're shoveled instead of quality writers doing writing. You know what I mean?"

Because studios, if they can make money the easiest way, they will do that and not pay the right people appropriately. So if they can get away with creating, having, you know, people that aren't as qualified, creating content, creating television shows, creating movies, using AI, the product won't be as good as it could be. Do you know what I mean?"

There was something I read the other day that said that they wanted, like when they're background actors, I think it was, that was painful. Part of the, part of the like, negotiation was that they wanted background actors to like have a scan of themselves or something and be able to use their AI likeness in perpetuity for free. I just read this like yesterday or something and, you know, so like, that part's already happening, but, you know, and that's going to suck if that happens. But like, yes, that part will happen, but there at the same time you're like, okay, well, do I really need to pay 100 people to stand in a crowd for 2 hours and eat my cheese sandwiches?

And Nicolas, the other one, the head of the Mi six in relation to AI, said he does not believe AI will replace human spies.
