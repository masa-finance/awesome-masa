So a bunch of the war room folks were eating on that this afternoon, which is awesome to see. So congrats to anybody who did get in and got a little win there. I was not personally fast enough to degen myself, so. But happy for all those who did. But that is cooking today. That's what's hot in the streets. It's a.

So what's going on here is this is built off the Gitcoin foundation, and Gitcoin has been around since, I believe, 2017. They've been giving out grants. So recently they decided to come up with this autonomous program to automate the gitcoin process. That way you don't have to reach out through the Gitcoin foundation every time you want to apply for a grant. Now you can use the quadratic funding, and that's coming out, I believe, in April. So people will be able to autonomously apply for grants through the Gitcoin foundation. Now they're featuring Vitalik, Zoe and all these other people just because they're contributors. Like, they just give cash to Gitcoin grants. I doubt Vitalik has anything to do with this NFT project. I mean, is it out of the question? No, but I really doubt he has anything to do with it."

I mean, that's a really great breakdown of actually, one, what this is, and two, if you can expect that Vitalik might be involved or not, I would probably lean with you there in terms of they're throwing him on there because he's a, if this has to do with the grant funding and everything like that, then he's technically tied into it because he's got, you know, his hand and obviously in that piece of it. So. But if I, you know, if you're asking me if Vitalik is going to be out doing Twitter spaces, pumping his bags on the quadratic, the quadratic funding collection, probably not. I don't think you're going to see him and Frank stare sharing a stage this week in your favorite Twitter space. So. But it actually sounds pretty fascinating what they're trying to do with it though. Did you crypto Jesus, were you actually, did you grab one? Is there reason to have one of these outside of the speculation if you're not looking for grants? What's the, what's the TLDR there?"

What do they talk about? What kinds of things are they into? And then we take bike and we. Well, we have to design the bike. The process of designing a bike is like six months, and we design it with all the little things that define that community, that represent that community. A community of youtubers. Right. So if it's for youtubers, and if a youtuber is out in the market looking for an e bike and he sees an e bike that is custom made for youtubers, I think that he's gonna go for the one that represents him instead of an off the shelf bike."

So this bike, because we're naming it Moonbird e bikes, and we're actually. We actually put up a proposal for the moonbirdao that is called the Lunar Society. The idea is to start with a proof of concept. It's a 500 limited edition e bike called the MB one. And this bike has all the little features that moonbirds are known for. Right. Like, just to give you a couple of examples, it has a. For a safety light it has a projector that projects your favorite NFT. That is CCO. It has to be cc zero for you to be able to project that NFT. The horn is the sound effect of an owl. Right? The design itself, the paint scheme is inspired on Moonbird 6289. That's a moomber that I own. And the alarm has a camera system that replaces the rear view mirrors. So instead of having rear view mirrors, you're now wearing kind of like. It's a video watch. It's a two inch video watch that transmits wirelessly. So when you put the bike on the side and you activate the alarm, you can walk away from it for up to 500ft. You can see what the bike is seeing, so that you know that that prevents theft. And as far as features, it is comparable to. Actually, it's better than most bikes at that price level. It's $2100, 750 watt motor that speeds up to 28 miles an hour. It has a range on full battery for 30 miles, and with pedal assist, you can go 60 miles. The battery is easily removable. And here's a cool part for the DJ. All of us, I consider myself a DJ, it's only 500 nfts. A lot of the nfts will have extra, you know, like gifts. For example, every NFT with it, with an NFT can redeem a bike. But a few nfts are gonna have two bikes. So you get one, but you get two. A few nfts are also going to have extra batteries. The battery is the most expensive part of an e bike. So having two batteries doubles your range. A few of them are going to have air tags. Air attacks are cool. People like air attacks when they get an e bike for, you know, safety, to prevent theft. And something that we thought about yesterday that I just, you know, immediately said, yeah, we're doing this. Are you familiar with infinite objects? They. They do, like, print video. So at least ten of the NFTs are also gonna have infinite object frames that come with the bike."

And, you know, it's one of these guys weekends where everybody's drinking all day, every day on the, you know, at the house. And he got to this point where he's just so on my nerves that I'm like. Because he keeps pushing me about. He's like, let's fight, let's fight, let's fight. And he's like, throwing the gloves at me, and I'm not doing this. Finally, I hit my breaking point and I snapped, and I was like, all right, let's go. We're going to do this. And so everybody gathered in the backyard like it was a scene out of a movie. We touched gloves and, man, 10 seconds, dude, I. 10 seconds. The kid was toast. And I felt really bad. I didn't want to do it. And I just got to this point where I couldn't, I couldn't not.

Like, when you go against a real fighter, it is a different animal, it's a different game. Like somebody who's like a trained national jujitsu champion, like him, who's been like, doing jujitsu his entire life. Like, that is terrifying. And it's like you can watch guys that are like, you know, 5450 pounds beat the crap out of guys that are like, you know, 6ft plus because of their actual ability. So I want to say that number one, and then number two, I was going to say, and I feel very weird with these two comments after crypto jeans is actually talking about real NFT stuff and important things. But did you guys ever play, like the how many game were like, is this. Me, my friend used to go through and like, you might see a kid who's maybe, I don't know, a bigger third grader, you'd be like. And the idea would be like, if, how many of those kids, if they were running at you full speed, trying to kill you, like, do you think you could take. And we would play the. How many games? So it would be like, I don't know, kids, adults, whatever it was. And we would just be in public be how many cup with over unders, like dead. So I like dead.

And now I just get a break. Des his keyboard. I think the really vital part of this fight that you're missing is you. And you. You exiled her from the start. Was Morgan. The first time I'd ever heard Morgan speak. She said something along the lines of, I can hit an inch, you know, grouping on a target from like, 2000ft. So the real question isn't, why are you?

So I kind of lived it for the first time watching this documentary. And holy crap, if you have not seen it, it is pretty. It's worth watching. It's only three episodes. It's totally worth watching. But anyway, that was why I said, bring up corn, Morgan, because corn was there, and they, you know, they were the doctor."

Of furry grizzly bear. I think that you could probably give him a good run because, I mean, Joe Rogan's only 194 pounds, and he's five eight now. He's a trained killer. Like, make no mistake about that. But I think 712 pounds up against 194 pounds. That's what I'm saying. Would be. And are we talking chamber with one of them has a bong?

So if he was a little sissy and couldn't take a punch, then I'd be worried about him. But, you know, he can take a punch and keep going, get that weight on Rogan, and then the other chamber come in to finish it off. So those are just my initial thoughts."

It's like having two, two and a half cuddly bears attacking a gnarly beast of Joe Rogan. I think you need about four or five cuddly bears. I've just got a vision of chamber just like bouncing off because he's just way too kind, way too soft. And like, I don't think you could take Joe Rogan even if there's four of you. I'm not that soft. First of all, we say cuddly bears, like bears aren't vicious animals. No, no, not the ones that I'm seeing. It's like, I'm talking about the ones that my grandmother bought me when I was a kid."
