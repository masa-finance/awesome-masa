Last week, we were talking about roman empire stuff, and I found the new kind of trendy TikTok thing, and I couldn't wait to ask you this. I even put it in the show notes, and it was. I've seen it a couple of times now where someone on TikTok basically is saying, like, when I was ten years old, I walked in to a subway sandwich restaurant, and I looked at the menu and I decided what my favorite sub was going to be. And I have not changed from that day. And I wanted to know if that rang true for you, because it definitely rang true for me. I always get. I don't go to subway a lot, but we all had that moment in time where we were hitting subway on a multi a couple of times a week, and I've consistently gotten the same thing since I was a teenager.

I have my dinner hat on and I am paying for food, I want to know that what I'm getting is I'm going to enjoy, right? It's not really a place I like to experiment, and this is probably a bad practice.

This is a new report from Dap Gamble, a community of experts in finance and blockchain technology. Upon analysis of 73,257 collections, the authors found that 69,795 have a market cap of zero ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. In practical terms, that means 95% of NFTs wouldn't fetch a penny today, a spectacular crash for assets that reached a trading volume of 17 billion amid a frenzied bull market in 2021. The study estimates that some 23 million investors own these tokens of no practical use or value. What do you think of these?"

And it's funny, I'm in a group text with cap and it's actually like a bunch of his buddies. And it's like, it's kind of like an alpha group chat. And you talk about like adult stuff, like stock things. And somebody posted it this weekend and tagged me in cap and they were like, oh my God, can this possibly be true? Are the numbers as bad as this thing says? And cap, like, I would have called it more like 99.9%. So this is actually super bullish. But then we went and looked up cap, looked up how much volume the top 100 collections are doing in the last 30 days, I think it was. And the. How much volume in 30 days would you say the 100th ranked NFT collection."

Like there's definitely not been 70,000 collections of value at one time. I would say most of those probably never had a value. I would like to see that sort of granular detail on this. Uh, I'm not defending at all the fact that, you know, most of these things are, are worthless, but I actually think, I actually think it's more skewed towards a positive thing that there's you know, 66,000 collections that have some kind of liquidity. That's way more than I would have thought. Um, I even said like, I wouldn't even be sure the top 100 did, which is what spurred captain to put it, to look it up. But yeah, interesting article. I think my favorite was NFT. People coming back and dunking on Rolling Stone for apes were in bed with Rolling Stone twice. They got two covers and one was like the first 2500 issue collectible with the ape cover. And then there was, I think one other one that they did. And like, you know, it's just funny to see everybody go full turn the other way and you know, it'll probably, if NFTs stick around as a technology, probably be one of those things that people point back to. Like the Internet article, right?"

So chat GPT going full on multimodal, and it is pretty mind blowing from the demos. So you can see in my tweet, there's about a minute long demo of the image upload and recognition feature. And it's pretty mind blowing. Like, it starts off with this dude uploading a picture of his bike. And he asked chat GPT, he asked chat GPT, how do I lower, or how do I raise my bike seat, right? And then chat DBT gives you an example of, or basically tells him step by step how to lower his bike seat. But that's not the impressive part, right? Because, like, obviously it could tell you how to lower your bike seat without seeing the bike for almost every bike on the planet, right? But then, so it goes on to, like, one step further where it tells them, oh, you've got to go to this lever and lower the lever, blah, blah, blah, uploads another picture, and it's of a certain part of the bike. And he says, is this the lever I'm looking for? Chat GBT looks at the image and says, no, that's not a lever. This is blah, blah, blah. You're going to need this kind of tool for it. Oh, if you have a picture of your tools, I can tell you which one is right. And so the person then proceeds to take a picture of their manual, like their instruction manual, and their toolbox open and uploads that. And chatupt responds, awesome. You see this? You see the set of tools with the Dewalt logo on it? That's an Allen wrench. That's what you'll need for this particular part that you're asking about. And I was just kind of, like, blown away. I'm like, oh, my goodness, it's crazy. So you can imagine a billion different use cases for uploading an image like that and asking chat GPT how to do certain things, um, just instructionally, both for, like, personal and business. Like, I am doing some statistical stuff with my football things and, and, like, I'm learning how to do this stuff for the first time. But sometimes I'll see charts or images or whatever, and I'm like, oh, I wonder how to recreate that. If I could just, like, screen grab something and ask it what it is and how to do it like that. That's a step that right now might take me super long, even with talking to chat TBT, because I don't have the contextual knowledge to be able to ask it the proper question, you know what I mean? But if it sees and can see what is on a chart and what type of chart it is or what kind of statistical modeling it's using. Well, then it can tell me exactly what I need to do. I don't know. It's pretty mind blowing. Uh, what do you think? Had you seen this today?"

But the other cool thing that it can now do is it can also, like, so the desktop and mobile version will now be able to take audio input from you so you can actually have a kind of two way conversation with it rather than just typing everything you want. Right. And then, and it'll actually speak back to you. So the other demo video that they showed was somebody like a mother asking chatubt for a bedtime story about a hedgehog named Larry. And they, and Chatubt then tells you the like speaks the story to you. It's pretty interesting. So I think that will be useful on the go. Right? Like sometimes text interface is not the best way or most convenient way to interact with these things, but like, natural language speaking probably gets the job done just as well. And now you can talk to it and it will talk back to you if you would like. What do you think?"
