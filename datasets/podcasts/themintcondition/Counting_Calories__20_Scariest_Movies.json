It's funny, I, you know, I first met my wife was 2016, and I wanted to lose some weight and so her and I did weight watchers together and. Yeah. And so at the time, I was living in an apartment by myself in New Jersey and I was drinking snapple all the time. Like, that was my go to drink. I'd probably drink four of them a day. And, like, when I started on weight watchers, like, if you've never done it before, they basically break out your day into, like, points. And you track, like, you scan something, it tells you how many points you have. And for my age, height and weight, I got like 31 points a day or something. And I would scan a snapple in and it would be like eight points. And I'm like, oh, no. And so from that day forward, I was like, I can't do that anymore. And, like, that didn't even account, like, beers or anything else I was drinking at the time. And so it was right then that I made the switch and started drinking, like, polar seltzers. And I would, I would bet I'm one of Polar's best customers. That's all I drink for the last five years or so, so. But even to your point about the psls, well, I mean, first of all, like I said, like, that you're. You're spot on of, like, definitely sneaky calories, uh, if you're drinking your calories, right? And then, um, but even with the pumpkin spice latte stuff I had, I actually did the same thing, like, last year or the year before, or I would drink a lot of them and they're very calorically."

And I do the pumpkin cream cold brew instead, which is just like, it's a cold brew and on top they throw like the little, you know, pumpkin whipped cream on it and so you still get a little bit of it but you're not getting that massive, you know, full on right bodied thing. So that is like half or less the calories of what a PSL is. So that's how I've been getting my, my, you know, thick."

It sounds like you have I think like those types of things. Like obviously when you can track your, like your calorical intake I think is a big one and you can see like what's shitty for like, you know, calorie wise, what's like, obviously like real red flags, like a blizzard from DQ is like the worst thing you could probably eat. But so I, I stopped. Yeah, don't want to drink any calories. So it's like, you know, it's water and like Coke zeros basically is what I drink. I also like incorporated like a Dennis Reynolds style eating cycle where I've basically skipped breakfast and most lunches and just, you know, crush, you know, water and diet cokes all day and then eat what I want at dinner and then maybe a little sneaky treat at the end of the day and yeah, you throw in a little, little cardio, little walking around and you know, you don't look like an absolute piece of shit. Yeah, I mean you're still not, I don't feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger at the moment. But you know, it's, I think it's the move. I've dropped some sizes. I'm getting. My neighbors are calling me out. Like, literally two neighbors in the last week have been like, you lost like a lot of weight. I'm like, oh, I wouldn't say a lot. I would say I was still good looking. They're making a big deal about it, which I don't like, but I definitely noticed it both times. But I don't really feel like I'm dieting either. Just like, you know, I eat the things I like to eat, but I just, it's when you eat them, I think is the big key."

They come in these little boxes and what I do is I take, that's my box of shame. And what I'll do is I'll stuff all of the little candy wrappers into the empty box of smarties.

Like, this is, uh, shit you only have to worry about when you are in the middle of your life having, uh, you know, to watch your weight and all of that kind of stuff. But, uh, yes, I relate to that very much the other day. So, um, my wife and I will hang out in our basement at night. That's where like the big tv is and all this stuff. And so we put the kids to bed, we come downstairs to hang out. That's where we, you know, have our snacks, watch our trash tv, and then, you know, that's, that's the nightly routine. And we'll do the same thing where we will house some, some candy and throw it the, the wrappers on the side of the, you know, couch or whatever. And like, and you know, most times we pick it up the same night, but some days we just go right to bed and we'll worry about it the next day, you know what I mean? My basement, up until football season has been a no kid zone, because I didn't want them to ruin my wonderfully new finished basement and with their, you know, tornadoes of chaos. And so, so the. But the other day, I brought them downstairs to, like, play around for a little bit, and the entire, first of all, the candy was still out, and the entire place was littered in wrappers, and I had to do, like, this frantic cleanup so that they didn't see the candy and just want to eat it all. And so I'm like, hey, look over there. I run and just cleaning it all up, and it made me think, you know, like, when you're a kid, right, and you don't want to go to bed, right? And, you know, like, why don't you want to go to bed as a kid? Like, you always feel like you're missing out on something, right? Or, like, the adults are doing something fun without you. I remember feeling those things when I was a kid, right? Like, you had that fomo, like, I don't want to miss anything thing. Or. And. And I remember my parents, like, telling me, oh, well, what the heck do you think we are doing? Like, we're not doing anything. We're going to bed, blah, blah, blah. And I was thinking about this recently, and I'm like, man, we do every night exactly what my kid's biggest fear must be happens when he goes to bed. Like, he goes to bed thinking, oh, I don't want to go to bed yet. Mom and dad are going to have a party without me. And we're like, no, we're not. Meanwhile, we're downstairs eating ice cream and cake and watching tv and doing all the fun stuff that he wishes he could be doing. And we're just having parties every night in that way.

I was in one of my shops, and I was talking to some people, and I overheard a conversation going on with one of the patrons of the store, with one of the people that worked there. And the guy had mentioned kind of like horror anthology or something like that, which piqued my interest. Right. And I'm a, you know, I'm a personable guy. I like to talk, and people are talking about stuff. I like to talk about at a weed store. I mean, it's a great place to have a conversation. So, you know, I kind of poke in, and he starts telling me this. So this guy creates these haunts, these high level, you know, attractions during this time of year. And so he started talking about it, and I'm like, oh, this sounds great. I'm like, is this something I could take, you know, my. My daughter to? And he's like, oh, these are 18 plus. There's kind of, like, we do a lot of full frontal stuff. And I'm like, oh, okay. And so he starts telling us more and more about it, and he says, he's like, we added this. He's like, well, normally you can either go in as an individual. So by yourself, you go through the whole thing by yourself or in a group of four random people. Those are the only two options. So you can either go by yourself or go with three other strangers. So he starts talking, and he's like, we added this thing this year where this. Where Mama tells you to wash your ass. And I'm like, what? And apparently. So this is super submersive. Is it? Submersive? Is that the right word? Where you're a part of the show? Yeah, immersive. Thank you very much. Immersive, where you're a part of. You're a part of the whole thing. So apparently they added this one portion where you're in a, like, an old, dilapidated kitchen sitting down on a chair, and this lady comes out and gives you a rag. And so there could be four. You know, there's four of you in this room. And she's like, okay, you know, no, no, I want you all to wash your asses. And like, he's like, yeah, so some people, like, pretend to like. And he said it way creepier than I'm saying right now. But so basically people will pretend to, like, you know, scrub a dub down below. And she's like, I didn't say wash your pants. I said wash your asses. And so apparently people are literally taking down their pants and cleaning themselves up back there. And he's like, well, you got to check out. I said, oh, you guys, like, on Instagram? He's like, no, we get kicked off Instagram a lot. I'm like, what is happening? He's like, just go to the website. So this guy leaves, and then the group of us remaining are now on the website. And it is. So I thought when he said full frontal, I thought he meant, like, the people. Like, the actors were full frontal. It's not the case. You get straight up ard and tortured in this place. Light r in this place. So, like, it's burlap sacks of full nudity. They strip you down. They, like, scratching pentagrams on your chest. It is absolutely bonkers. So I don't know who's going to these. I mean, you have to imagine the people that are visiting these places, you know, they're just not right. There is something in their core that is broken because I didn't. I didn't know it was to that level, but this was. This was a. Almost a snuff film at this point."

It's considered a pioneer of extreme haunted attractions. Founded in San Diego by Russ McKamey, it was originally located on his property until it was moved to Tennessee in 2017. It operates year round, offering visitors tours that can last up to 8 hours. To participate, guests must sign a liability waiver that includes the inability to leave the experiment experience without the staff's permission, and being subjected to various forms of physical and psychological torture, including having bones broken, teeth removed without anesthesia."

Oh, this is the right one. So instead, McKamey accepts dog food for his pet dogs. So that's how you get in, is you bring him dog food. And, like, the more I went into this, like, the more this guy just seems like he's just getting away with some, like, fucked up perversion of torturing people. And somehow it's legal because he makes people sign a waiver. The guest must be at least 21 years of age, 18 to 20 with parental consent, apparently. I guess maybe there's more than one location. The Alabama location allows only guests 21 and older. The tour lasts from eight to 10 hours, but this was it. No guest has made it all the way through. McKamey originally did not allow safe words for the tour, but has since reportedly allowed them, so guests have the option of ending the tour immediately. The house operates year round, reportedly a waiting list of over 24,000 people. The newest iteration of the tour, a ten hour experience called Desolation, offers a prize of 20,000 for successful completion. McKamey deducts 500 from the prize for every failed challenge or use of profanity. Oh, my God. During the tour, employees of the manor may physically assault patrons, waterboard them, force them to eat and drink unknown substances, have them bound, gagged, engaged in other forms of physical or psychological torture. Participants must also be. May also be drugged during their experience. Journalist Tara west has reported that in communities where the tours stage, residents question how it remains legal, even with waivers. A volunteer guide testified that the 40 page waiver signed by participants listed such possible risks as having teeth extracted, being tattooed, and having fingernails removed."

And I put this in a category of the fact that if I watch a scary movie, I can watch it on my own. It's not too bothering. But normally if you're with somebody, they'll want, they'll want you to go to the toilet if there's a break. And it's like, what the hell's going on? It's like, it's not that scary. It's like you watch a foreign movie, I'm talking about korean horror movies. And there's one especially that I thought I've watched a couple of times and it still gets me every time. It's called the two sisters. And it's a little bit, the two."

But it is one of those where it really gets in your head and messes with you. It's like, I don't want to go to the toilet on my own, so please come with me. Do you want to go to the toilet? Because, you know, I'm going to give you some more drinks to make sure that you go with me. But no, foreign movies, especially korean horror movies, are by far the scariest. And I highly recommend the two sister to anybody who's not seen it."

So basically it's like somebody will just buy a new phone and they get that number, they get a phone call and it's a spirit that is going to come and rip the soul out of you. And it's one of those flickering sort of, it appears skittering down the hallway. It's one of those really gets you very good."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "That is good. Yeah, no, well, it's funny, I actually keep my subtitles on by default these days. I don't know why, but I just do. But I feel you that I don't want to read during my movie, however. All right, that's going to do it for us today. More chatter on scary movies on Monday. We would like. This is fun. One chamber. I like this. I liked this episode. Appreciate everybody coming out, all nine of you. We appreciate you. Have a wonderful weekend. Don't forget to catch the rest of our content over the weekend. We have Saturday morning cartoons tomorrow, Deegen bets Sunday morning and then back to our regularly scheduled weekday programming. Until next time, keep the mic hot."
