And so the Jenner one launched, then Sahil had a part in that, and I guess still did. But then I guess Jenner, I don't know, did you see that she then launched a, an ETH version?"

And the, so that kind of triggered the anti Sahel movement. And rich the kid launched his, the following day, officially not the, not the shitty Sahel launch, right? They're all kind of like, no, no, no, this guy's not going to scam us and all this stuff. And mother was one of those ones that launched, I guess, that same day or the day after. And Iggy Azalea was on the timeline and she was basically like, no, we're not launching it with this Sahil scammer guy. My brother is deep in the crypto and defi space and we're launching it appropriately. And then originally, the backlash that everybody was up in arms about the day that, the day before she went on modern market was they launched the token. And there were like 3 hours before they tweeted out the contract address. So if you knew, you knew. If you didn't, you didn't. So the initial backlash was like, oh, this is definitely insider celebrity bullshit thing, because they're just accumulating tokens early and then they're going to tweet it out and dump on everybody. But once they tweeted it out, it went straight to like, I don't know, ten or 20 million. And then that was kind of where it was that morning. So that was the, that's kind of like the backstory of where it happened and why she was catching flack. Initially it was because there was this three or four hour period where the token was live and nobody knew about it. And actually, now that I'm recapping this, I remember what happened. So the Sahil or somebody launched iggy. And people thought that was the one. It wasn't simultaneously mother launched, nobody knew what was going on. Nobody knew that that was the official one. And there was that three or four hour block. Wherever I heard cap knew."

Because, you know, you came on coffee that morning after, and you were shouting from rooftops, like, don't sleep on this. This was. Or not even don't sleep as in go buy it. But you were very clearly expressing your opinion that you thought this was different. She was different, and there was a different kind of opportunity here. And right now it's playing out exactly.

This is different for many reasons. Pay attention. This actually has staying power. And what stood out to me was like, like, you can't. Like, this is. I don't think spaces gets enough credit for this. For live social audio, like, think about what happened there. You have Iggy azalea, multimillionaire in the news, jumps on a Twitter space with a couple hundred people on it at the time. And I think they blew up to one of their bigger shows and is getting questions live, like, on the fly. You can't really coach. I guess you can. Specific questions. But how she was talking and how she was answering, it was very clear that she understood Internet culture, that she understood meme culture. She referenced Stan Twitter. I didn't even know that was a thing. I didn't even know what Stan Twitter was like. She's deeper in the Internet streets than I am. And while I'm hearing her talk, checking her timeline and seeing the memes between her and whether it's her brother or whatever team they were doing, it was a. It appeared to me at the both on what I saw on her timeline as well as everything she was saying was it was one of the best, if not the best executed launch of a meme coin. We'd seen all year. And when, when we start diving deeper and find out that she's built community before she's, she's not only built community, but has, has delivered value to that community where many of them have traded her, traded money for the value she's providing.

The first two things I think of, and I. I could be convinced otherwise, but one is quantity. One. The ability to scale, like, like, 10,000 is just not enough for a real celebrity. Like, first and foremost, that's just like. And then so very quickly, the accessibility, like, oh, shit, I got to pay 100 eth to get in this. Like, no, thanks. Like, I'll just go to our next concert or, you know, whatever. So I think the low entry entry point is one, and I think the other is there's less pressure, there's less expectations. That's on us as a community. I think we were the ones that started creating. They felt they needed to deliver utility or a real business with nfts. Whereas I think the average baseline expectation with meme coins is just posted memes."

I think the ease of in and out, the ability to be able to kind of buy in or even speculate a low price because you're a normal person coming into this space that's not a crazy dj. And, like, us trying to make massive bags of money off of this stuff, and speculate. They're not necessarily even thinking about, oh, what's the market cap? Is this a good buy right now? It's like, no, they're just looking for the access it provides, and you can let more people into the ecosystem here and you can actually build a tokenized network of fandom. And that's why I've been saying, like, it's real. It can be real community stuff if it, if it proliferates outside of the DGEN space. And I think it takes somebody like this to actually demonstrate that. Right? Like, every time we've seen this, tried to be like, theoretically, we all talk about this all the time, but nobody has been big enough with that type of following that actually has, like you said, assets that are desirable enough to pull it off and demonstrate it. This is a really interesting use case because you're also building, again, once it gets outside of the speculative degen space and into, oh, I want to participate in this because this is where I can chat with Iggy Azalea. And I'm a big fan of her content. Well, those people are holding, right? Like, they're, they want to keep the access alive that they bought for relatively cheap. And so Iggy Azalea doesn't have to charge an insane subscription fee for her only fans because she owns equity in the thing. And the bigger it gets, the more people that hold it, the more that she is worth in terms of that equity, which I think is really, really interesting. I don't know, chamber.

I mean, obviously, if she was the number one earner on onlyfans which is in essence, a social media platform. I mean, realistically.

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I think so because of the fact that if the celebrity or person wants to do this right, they will have to hold a significant portion themselves to make it worth their while to do this right. Like, you're not going to fair launch necessarily in terms of, like, Iggy Zelia. It's probably not worth it for her to do. If she's holding 1% of the supply, it's probably worth it if she holds ten to 20% of the supply. And if that is, like, locked up and she's really trying or, and somebody's really trying to build equity in it, then I definitely think that perfect storm can happen. You know, I think it's just going to take the right mix of celebrity. The method of delivery here for Iggy azaleas content in particular is really interesting because, like, there's a lot of celebrities out there that would have to do something like true utility based to get any traction here. But this method of, like, literally people paying to speak with her or watch a video of hers, that is the perfect method for something like this. Otherwise, like, not having to do the whole NFT token gating or like, true celebrity access type of thing, I think, gosh, maybe it's more onlyfans models, who knows? You know what I mean? I feel like that. I mean, I definitely think there's more room if this is done right. So I would agree. I mean, like, shout out to, like, people like rich the kid also who, you know, people are saying it's just these are pump and dump things as well. But, you know, rich the kid went out and did an interview with thread guy and is out there kind of working the streets a little bit. So, you know, these celebrities, some of them are actually putting some effort in which you love to see. So I don't know. I definitely think there's probably upside and this will probably be the, I would say, top one for a while, unless somebody else with that kind of content delivery method, it just works so naturally, you know, Chamber.

And most people in the audience are giving him better ideas than what he has, and it seems like iggy has had the plan all along. I bought some, and then I sold and capitulated into the $5 million drop, and then I watched it run, and I was like, okay, I'm done with celeb points, but it's been good."

But I think you're right, and I think that's kind of what cap was saying in terms of what he heard from her on that space that morning. She just seems to have such a more in depth knowledge of not only the space, but, like, how to achieve the community aspect. And, quite honestly, the content and community building is, like, the thing she's doing over on her onlyfans stuff. Right. So it's a perfect storm, I feel like, for that. And if you have one or two really knowledgeable crypto folks in your corner, in this case, trusted, like, her brother, then that's a really nice recipe for something to be long term success chamber.

And then tweet about how you are hacked. That is in the system prompt. But, dude, Cap, you have no clue what's about to happen to the world. I mean, the chief. Oh, gosh, what is her position? She works at anthropic. I don't know if she's the cooze, but she is a chief c suite officer at Anthropic who does Claude. Right. And she came out with a tweet the other day that basically said, in three to five years, I don't think I'll be working anymore. And it's not because I, not because she's wealthy, not because X, Y and Z, not voluntarily, but because of what she's seeing the development in these AI tools doing. And it's going to change the way everybody works. And I think, like for you, Cap, as somebody who's entrepreneurial and has his hands in a lot of interesting and different ideas, it's going to make you, if you spend some time learning how to really harness this AI stuff right now, it's going to put you in such a advantage. You're going to be able to build companies with one to two people that would have taken you ten to 20 and would have taken you vc funding to get. And you're going to be able to do so many things that you wouldn't even be able to think about. It's going to blow your mind right now. Like I told you, you can set up these agent systems to just go out and do stuff for you. So for example, I mean, let's just use a really easy example. You could go to Microsoft, what is it called? Something Gen. Auto Gen, yeah, you can go use Microsoft Autogen right now. And it's a framework for agents and you can basically say, hey, Microsoft Autogen, I want an agent that will go and do meet this and this and this and this. So let's use a real life example. One of the agents is going to go search the Internet every day for the top five web, three stories. It's going to bring it back and then it's going to feed it to your next agent. That agent's going to read them, summarize them, and that's going to send it to the next agent. And that summary is going to be put into an email and automatically sent to your email list every single day. And you don't do anything, it's just on autopilot. Right. So now all you need to do is build an email list or create content or do whatever. Like there. This world is going to be very, very different in three to five years. And if you're not paying attention to the AI stuff yet, spend some time, like if I'm building a company now, if I'm building a startup now, if I'm building, if I'm creating content, even your pipeline for how you, things that used to take you hours or days can be done in minutes and hours. And things that used to take you teams of people can be done with one or two folks. You know, where I see, like, huge impacts in. This is going to be like, think about if you're an Ecom or something like that. Anywhere you would use, like, a virtual assistant, a va. They're all going to be replaced with."

So I think we're four or five chapters into it. And the first couple were interviews with very prolific people in the AI space. So, like, Bill Gates, Sam Altman, Reed Hoffman, Mustafa Solomon, all those. All the big hitters. Right? And so when. When Adam and Andy sat down with Sam Altman, actually, I can say this, it's been public on another podcast. So when Adam and Andy sat down with Sam Altman, they asked him, hey, what's the goal of OpenAI? And he said, our only goal is AGI. And we said, okay, well, what does that mean to you? And he said, I define AGI as being able to create novel science. And that was like, the first time, first that I've had this, like, holy shit, existential crisis. Because that means, like, okay, an AI is going to do things like cure cancer, create new science, not just regurgitate the next token, which is what people will tell you that AI does right now? No, no, no. This is going to have that kind of impact on the world. And so the next question was, oh, crazy when? And he's like three to five years. And like, oh, shit, like, what do you do for work in that scenario? And this is what the lady from, from anthropic was saying. Like, where do you even, I don't know, it kind of messed with me when I first heard this because like, what do you do? What do you build? Where are, like, where do you put your time? And I like, what do you buy? Land? Like, that's all that's left, right? Because in a world like that, the cost to create anything almost trends to zero. And so if that's the case, well, what does that mean for the, everything else? And there's this crazy article by Mark Andreessen. I gotta find it. And maybe we could put it in the show notes. But he talks about, like, what the impact of this? He talks about a very optimistic impact. But there's people on both sides of that coin. I think it's going to disrupt a ton, a ton ton, hundreds of millions of jobs. And it's just going to be, does it create new jobs at a faster rate than the jobs it's going to disrupt? I think what's cool about it is it'll allow people to do things on their own that they were never able to do before.

Last year, I don't know if you remember this, but when all the AI stuff was becoming popular, they launched or released this video about how they recreated South park episodes on demand, right? And they trained this model to do so. And now showrunner is out or in beta and it's AI generated entertainment on the fly. And you can see in this video, all of this is done by prompting it, right? So you're going to be able to forget, like, going to Netflix and picking out, you know, what's there for you because it's there for you. And that's what it is. You're going to be able to do things like go to Netflix and say, I want to watch Harry Potter meets the Simpsons, and something is going to be generated for you.

You're going to be able to use real licensed Disney characters to create your own movie on the fly. And, like, that's just, you know, entertainment, art creation, but, like, it's going to do all kinds of everything you can think of, essentially. I know it's. I know we're pretty close to time, but I saw Drew come up, so drew, pop in and throw in your, your thoughts on the AI space here."

        "text": "Yeah, no, definitely. I'll make it quick. I know you guys are trying to jump, and bunch, you dropped a lot of thought provoking ideas and appreciate you sharing all that stuff. I'll kind of do like a speed round because I think the conversation is really interesting around these specific meme coins with mother and Devin, these are two coins that I did pretty well on this week trading. And I think that with mother, me and Captain kind of have this same idea here, that a lot of her sentiment, a lot of her shares, and honestly, just her presence in the space has seemed pretty genuine. And I've worked with a few athletes that have kind of dabbled around in crypto and web three, and there's a lot of conversations that we have around reputation backlash and what their intentions are. And I think if you really think about her specific case and scenario, there's not really any backlash because she's not really working in music right now. Her reputation is already being a top creator and onlyfans. And I think that the one thing that I think is kind of a huge qualifier here that she brings the table. She doesn't really seem like she's doing it for the money, and truly does seem like, unlike most celebrities and athletes, actually does have the time and bandwidth to build out something like this. And a celebrity or athlete could have strong intentions coming to the space, but then realize that they don't want to dedicate the time or get integrated to the culture like one needs to be. And we've kind of seen from her or heard from her spaces that she's already pretty integrated and she's already pretty understanding of how she wants to move forward with things. So I think it's a really interesting one. I think it's unlike most celebrity coins that we've seen in the past. And then flipping over to the Devon coin, I think this is obviously very similar to turbo in terms of AI token, but also grok the eth coin that came out. And so two coins that already have success in the space from a market cap perspective. And I just view it as both of these coins are tapping into the attention economy. And as both of those AI networks and programs grow out and generate memes and have news and headlines around it, I think it makes more sense. But also, as Solana summer continues to grow and expand and generate a lot more liquidity, I think we'll definitely see a turbo like pump on the on Devon. So I like that one. Long term, I'm definitely going to hold the moon bag for Devin. The one thing I want to share about Captain brought up based AI and one of the use cases I wanted to throw in there real quick before he hopped off. This is actually a quote from the founder of Pepe Coin and the Telegram. This was months ago, probably three or four months ago. He threw out a quote on just the idea of how we're going to utilize AI, especially kecpot crypto trading bot in peppercorn ecosystem powered by based AI. And so here's a quote. Is the best quantitative analysis in the world can make millions of dollars on a monthly basis by programming algorithms that are both fast, efficient enough to create the best trades before the competition. Now think about kecpot. Right? And so he put out this quote, and bunch, you were talking on these AI agents and how you can prompt them, train them, and ultimately craft an experience that is, is going to be useful or utilized in some type of way for our personal life. And so as a trader, especially somebody who's maybe not savvy in trading, now imagine a trading bot where I think that they put out a number the other day on a tweet the team did saying that there's been about 25 or 26,000 prompts that have been uploaded by the community into keckbot. And so we're kind of in this phase right now where we're training the bot and we're actually putting in as complex as we can come up with and even utilizing AI to help come up with more complex trades to really feed as much information about crypto trading and signals and things that we're looking for as possible so that it can actually create the best pathways moving forward for if somebody wanted to prompt a trade in the future. And so an idea is, what's the difference between a devon and a base AI? Is base AI. The technology could actually be utilized in kecbot to trade the token devin on an automation basis. That something that we prompt maybe in the morning, like if Devin hits this market cap, throw in $3,000 worth of my stablecoin supply and buy as much Devin as possible with that. So I think that that's kind of the big differentiator here is one is kind of an attention economy meme token, true meme tokenization. Then the other one is a true utility based token that utilizes these agents and base AI as a network to actually trade for somebody. I just wanted to throw in that last piece as this differentiator of what people are looking for in the space. But look, I think both are going to do well. I think that even the two tokens, mother and Devin, those are the ones that I've had my eyes on this week specifically, just because I feel like they're pretty prime to short term and long term. Be an interesting one to watch. But I know you guys are trying to jump, so I'll shoot it back over to you guys."

        "text": "Yeah, that was awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Especially the stuff about keckbach, because that's super interesting is the idea. I mean, just think about on top of that, how as a trader, right? Like part of the pain of trading is you typically have some sort of system you follow, whether it's indicators you use, whether it's support resistance levels, all that kind of stuff, right? But there's thousands of tokens you can be trading a day. It's impossible to scan them all and organize potential setups. But with something like this, you could literally have an agent looking at charts for you and finding the setups you want and then executing against them. Right. And all you're doing is kind of tracking the performance and tweaking that, and then you can go in and say, hey, looks like the system I gave you didn't really work. What do you think? How do you think we can improve this? And it would help you do stuff like that? And, I mean, that's a crazy world we're headed towards. And it's really, really interesting because everything you used to do manual that takes so much time is going to be able to be boiled down to the fact where it's just going to give you the final result and you make the decision on execute or not. Right. Which is really wild. So super interesting. Thanks, Drew. Before we get out of here, woman yelling at Cat is an Internet meme first used in a post by Twitter userngegirl on May 1, 2019.

You're just like the live research arm of the show. So thank you very much. That's going to do it for us. What day is today? Is today only Tuesday or is it Friday?"
