Speaker E: Genesis reaches an agreement with Gemini, Binance suspends bank transfers in us dollars, and the UK moves ahead with a digital pound. Welcome back to Real Vision crypto daily briefing. My name is Mark Olivera. I'm joined by my co host, Ash Bennington. What's going on, Ashley?
Speaker C: Hey, Marco. Great to be here with you again today.
Speaker E: Yeah, great. Always great to be with you, Ash. We also have Piers Ridyard from Radix. Later in the show, we'll talk about how radix aims to make defi a better user experience. How's it going, Piers?
Speaker D: It's very good. Great to be on the show.
Speaker E: Yeah, we're excited to have you. Looking forward to that for the viewers. Stay tuned. That's going to be a little bit later in this segment. For now, let's look at the latest price analysis. Bitcoin is virtually unchanged on the 24 hours basis. This comes after a five day losing streak. Bitcoin is currently trading at around 23% 3000. It's down slightly on a weekly basis. Investors are awaiting comments from Jay Powell. We're expecting a speech in a few hours. Ash, how's ethereum looking?
Speaker C: Well, Marco. Ether is pretty much in line with bitcoin today. Ether is chading, trading little change on a 24 hours basis, currently trading at just over $1,600. Unlike bitcoin, though, ether is up on a trailing seven day basis. According to a report by Coinshares, investor sentiment continues to improve. Digital asset investment products saw net inflows of $76 million last week. That's a fourth consecutive week of net inflows. Coin shares says most of that has gone into bitcoin, with grayscale being the biggest beneficiary Marco, what's our biggest performer today?
Speaker E: Well, that's the graph ticker symbol, GRT. It's up more than 30% on a 24 hours basis and nearly 100% for the past week. The graph is an indexing protocol. Coindesk says the ecosystem has seen big growth lately. Let's look at about our top story here today. Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis has reached an agreement with its main creditor, including main creditors, including crypto exchange Gemini. The announcement was confirmed by Gemini co founder Cameron Winklevoss, who tweeted that the plan provides a path for earned users to recover their assets. Earn was Gemini's yield earning program, set up in partnership with Genesis. However, when Genesis halted redemptions and then filed for bankruptcy, millions of Gemini earn user funds became locked. Ash, I know you've been following this story since the beginning. What's your take on this development?
Speaker C: Well, you know, first of all, the most important point to point out is that this still requires judicial approval. This is going through a bankruptcy court. So the fact that the a creditor has agreed is not necessarily, does not make it a done deal. Let's just say, I guess my question here is whether other creditors might object to this. We don't know. So it's something that's out there right now. Cameron Winklevoss said Gemini will contribute up to $100 million extra to earn users as part of the plan. But again, just to point out, not yet a done deal until there's judicial approval. Marco.
Speaker E: Yeah, not a done deal until there's judicial approval. I mean, I think the big question looming, Ash, on everyone's mind is where's DCG? Which is Genesis parent company going to find the money to sort the situation at Genesis out? What are your thoughts on that?
Speaker C: Well, it's a great question. In fact, it's the key question. I want you to just quote here from the Financial Times. Cryptoconglomerate digital currency group has begun to sell shares in several of its most prized cryptocurrency funds at a steep discount as it seeks to raise capital to pay creditors back from its of its bankruptcy lending arm. One would think that's not something that GBTC, excuse me, that's not something that DCG would love to do. Obviously, some of these assets, including GBTC, I know everything sounds alike here. The initials sound similar, the company name sounds similar. It's confusing. But look, I just wanted to show this chart really quick. This is the GBTC net asset value discount chart. This chart that you're looking at now on the screen shows the discount between the net asset value price of the underlying bitcoin of GBTC and the market price. As you can see, there's a little leg down there on the right. Obviously, this showing an increasing selling pressure as folks believe that they just want to pay less for those underlying assets because of the challenges. Again, this is not a situation that DCGC would like to find itself in, but it is here. And to the reporting in the FT, they are attempting to raise money according to the FT by doing just that, by selling some of those assets. Marco?
Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. I think there's probably another contingent of people that think that they're getting a great deal by being able to buy those GBTC shares much cheaper than when you'd buy for a spot piece of bitcoin.
Speaker C: Well, that's what makes a market, right? You've got buyers and sellers or two side size of the transaction and that's what makes it interesting. And that's why we like following them.
Speaker E: Absolutely. Well, moving on to this next story that we got here, Binance was trending on Twitter earlier, and here's why. So starting tomorrow, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, is going to suspend bank transfers in us dollars. Although this news sounds bad, the change won't affect many people. It's only going to affect Binance.com users, not Binance Us, which is a separate entity. Binance CEO CZ says the change will only impact about 0.01% of its monthly active user users. In a follow up tweet, CZ suggests the issue is a binance banking partner withdrawing support. So, Ash, this is clearly a setback for Binance, but the impact is relatively small. I mean, we're talking about 0.01% of its monthly active users. Do you think though, that this speaks to a larger issue of banks withdrawing support from crypto?
Speaker C: Well, you know, a couple of points here. First, it's not a surprise. This was telegraphed in advance. This was something that we knew was coming. Look, every time someone mentions this story, they say it sounds bad, but it's not really a big deal. That is the sort of received opinion about this. I guess my sort of skepticism is the question that you just asked, and it is an open question. We don't know the answer to it. Does this represent a broader trend of banks withdrawing support for digital assets in general or for binance in particular? We don't know the answer to that question yet. That is the received opinion on it, that it isn't a big deal, but we just don't know and it's something we're going to keep watching. By the way, I just wanted to read this quote from CZ. It is worth noting that USD bank transfers are leveraged by only 0.01% of our monthly active users. This was the point you made earlier. However, we appreciate this, that this is still a bad user experience and the team is working on quickly resolving this issue. So there is an admission there. Obviously this is not a great experience for the users. By the way, let me just throw this out with, with a skeptics hat on, talking about open questions and something that we truly just don't know the answer to. This idea that it's point zero. Point zero one percent of monthly active users. Is that the same as dollar volume? It's not necessarily the same as dollar volume, I can tell you that. So whether or not this represents a higher percentage of the dollar volume, that is an open question and it's going to be an interesting one. We're going to follow the story. Look, we can't read too much into it. It's still early. We don't know the facts, but we're going to keep watching to make sure that those facts come out and that our viewers and listeners can hear them.
Speaker E: Yeah, that's definitely something we have to wait for the facts. I mean, obviously there's always speculation going on anytime that there's stuff going on with finance there, especially on Twitter. Speculation is especially rampant when it comes to binance as of late, Ash.
Speaker C: Right. And that's what we try not to engage in here. Real vision is rampant speculation. We go through the facts, we give some opinion, we give some analysis, but we're just going to have to wait and see as this story plays out because it's still very much a fluid situation, as the saying goes. Marco.
Speaker E: Yeah, well, we have a couple updates here from the UK as well. So decrypt reports the UK is laying the groundwork for the launch of a digital pound which is dubbed bitcoin, which could be used, which could be in use by the late two thousand twenty s. The bank of England and the treasury have formed a joint task force and launch public consultations to consider the design and implementation of the currency until June 7. So, Ash, it seems like the race to launch CBDC's central bank digital currencies is well underway across major economies. What's your take here?
Speaker C: Well, my take, big picture, top line is that central bank digital currencies are one of the largest open questions, one of the largest wild card issues that we have out there. In the space right now. If we do get major developed market economies adopting cbdcs, it changes the very sort of nature and structure of the digital asset ecosystem, particularly, as you might imagine, of course, stable coins. But more broadly than that, it's going to have a very large impact. We know that the UK is moving ahead with digital asset regulation, attempting to harmonize their traditional capital markets, sort of regulatory and legislative framework to include digital assets. This seems to me to be part and parcel of it. It would be just an enormous step, as you pointed out. You said it exactly right, Marco. There are still some issues to sort out here. Design issues, including privacy. Specifically, according to Andrew Bailey, specifically who is the governor of the bank of England, actually mentions the issue of understanding the privacy implications of it. That's per decrypt in the article that we showed on screen there a moment ago. Talking of decrypt, I want you to show, I want you to read, rather, this quote. Quote. Under the current plans, neither the government nor the bank of England would have access to personal data. The private sector would handle access to the currency through digital wallets and would, and there would be initial restrictions on how much an individual or businesses could hold. So two pretty striking things about that report from decrypt. Number one, the idea of limits on holdings for individuals as well as businesses. By the way, per the decrypt article, they say that this is just an initial restriction. How long those restrictions remain in place, I guess remains an open question. But it does sort of tell you something about the challenges of implementing something like this. The second thing that's interesting to me is this idea of a two tiered system. Essentially, you have a central bank digital currency with some private sector involvement in terms of the wallets and how those transactions are processed. In many ways, this mirrors what we currently have in the United States and in England as well, in the UK more broadly, which is this two tiered banking system. You have a central banking system, the central bank, that obviously monitors and does direct monetary policy, which has clear macroeconomic implications, specifically solving for the two key variables in macroeconomics that central bankers and policymakers are interested in, which are, of course, the growth of the economy, which is directly tied to the labor markets, the full employment directive, and then, of course, price stability, dealing with inflation or deflation in the case of significant recession. So this is obviously a very complicated type of thing to work out to figure out how you get the public private sector balance correct. And it is interesting, there's almost this thought of kind of layers of execution here. So you have a central bank issuing the currency, and yet you have retail banks, commercial banks, sort of engaged in the wallet component of it, processing transactions. I think it's going to take him a while to get this sorted out, even for a pilot project. But I have to tell you, Marco, it's a really interesting thing to watch.
Speaker E: It definitely is an interesting thing to watch. Maybe some people out there might be a bit cautious about that. So there was a positive thing that I saw in that story that I think came from Jeremy Hunta, UK's chief financial minister. He said cash is here to stay in one of his statements here, as he was talking about the digital pound. So for the people out there that aren't very pro stablecoin, pro cbdcs, looks like they'll still have the option to use cash.
Speaker C: Yeah, that certainly sounds that way, based on the article.
Speaker E: Yeah. Well, so I have another interesting story out of the UK. According to an exclusive report by Alt Fi Challenger bank, Revolut is now offering crypto staking. The service is available to customers in the UK and the European Economic Area. It supports staking of Polkadot, Tezos, Cardano and Ethereum. Yields range from 3% to 11.65%. But obviously, you know, anytime we're talking about staking, nothing is guaranteed. Crypto staking, for people who don't know, means you're lending out your assets for a certain period of time and it helps secure the blockchain and you earn rewards in return. So, Ash, we've been hearing a lot about staking since Ethereum's move to proof of stake. Obviously, this is. Staking could be slightly different, obviously, because it's on a centralized exchange. It could be, or centralized platform there. But what are your thoughts on this?
Speaker C: Well, I wanted to talk just a little bit more generally about the structure of this. So you mentioned this phrase, challenger bank. Its sometimes called a neo bank. This idea that these are sort of these hybrid financial institutions, theyre kind of software development companies, but theyre also quasi banks to point to revolut in particular. Its not a bank, its not regulated like a bank. There was a story back in December that BBC ran that got a lot of pickup in the UK about a victim of fraud, a woman who had an account with Revolut, who's a victim of fraud unrelated to revolut, but she was fraudulently defrauded of some of her funds and revolut essentially refused to refund those defrauded funds. So, look, the reality is, if you have an ATM card that you're using, with chase or someone else, a large bank here in the United States, and you're a victim of fraud or a credit cardinal, you get those funds back, the bank takes responsibility for it. It's part of the reason why they're able to charge us fees. The reality is, this is an open question about how this works. And look, by the way, we've obviously seen some of the risks and dangers of staking with, with Voyager, with Celsius, and with others here in the US. I'm not trying to be negative about it. This is just the reality of the world that we find ourselves in. These are sort of centralized platforms. They're not truly decentralized. I'm sure Piers will have some stuff to add about this when he comes on the show about this dichotomy, but the reality is that there is clearly risk in the system. It's also interesting to me, this idea, and I sort of touched on it in a different context with the Boe, the Bank of England in the prior story. They have this stack of layers of execution. One of the challenges that we see in the system is problems with UI Ux, that's user interface, user experience. These systems are not the kind of thing that, that folks who don't have master's degrees in computer science are generally comfortable with. And you see this desire, this demand for people who are going to intermediate that, put layers in between it, so you make it easier, so you have a more traditional experience. I don't know about you, but I generally find going up to my bank's website pretty easy. It's easy to see where my balance is. It's easy to understand how much and when I have to pay my credit card. I mean, these kinds of things are. The user interface component has been, has been dramatically simplified so that just about everyone uses them here in the US and throughout the developed world today. These are challenges right now that we still have in the DeFi space. And by the way, there are other challenges. We'll probably talk about those with peers as well, in terms of security bridges. There's lots of challenges in this space. It's incredibly early. It's incredibly exciting. That's why we have so much interest in this space. Obviously, we see this idea of programmable money, which is something that folks who have backgrounds in computer science, folks who have backgrounds in finance and banking are incredibly excited about. We talked yesterday with the starkware folks about the abstraction of accounts. These are incredibly, incredibly interesting topics and things that we're going to see roll out in the next one 3510 years. And I suspect it's going to change the way we do just about everything. Not just banking, but commerce more broadly, social media, web, three applications. It's an incredibly exciting time, but we do have to say, obviously, it is very early and there are risks, Marco.
Speaker E: Yeah, there's obviously risk, and who better to talk about that than peers? We're going to get to him in a second, but first, I want to remind the viewers to join in on the conversation. Put down your questions in the chat, wherever you're watching. We're going to ask the best ones later in the show. Today, remember, real vision members take priority, but the good news is membership is free. You can head over to realvision.com crypto and sign up. With that said, let's bring in our guests, Piers Ridgyard, the CEO of Radix, which calls itself radically different defi. Welcome to the show, Piers.
Speaker D: Thank you very much. It's great to be here.
Speaker E: It's great to have you. Well, Ash, I'm going to be back with some other news stories in a bit, but take it away. Thanks.
Speaker C: Marco Pierce, welcome to the show.
Speaker D: Hey, yeah, good, thank you.
Speaker C: Well, it's a pleasure to have you here. First, tell us about Radix. What is it? What's the use case? What problems are you looking to solve? And of course, the question everyone wants to know, why does the world need another layer? One protocol?
Speaker D: Yeah, no, there's a great question. So, Radix is a public, decentralized ledger entirely focused on creating incredible user experiences for defi builders and users. And the reason we want to do this is we believe, I think, like you guys do as well, that decentralized finance is inevitable. It is going to eat the entire world of global finance. However, it's not a question of if, but when, but the user experience today of crypto sucks. You get hacks, you get exploits, you get, you get congestion. And then if people are escaping that, which I think what a lot of these things are like revolut offering staking, or FTX offering yield, or Celsius offering yield, you end up with the centralized problem again. And so all of this makes crypto hard, actually using crypto directly hard, and it keeps the industry niche. So Radix is 100% focused on changing that. And the technology stack that we've built to solve these problems goes live in q two of this year.
Speaker C: So let me ask you that.
Speaker D: Yeah, go for it.
Speaker C: No, I was going to ask you, Piers, in terms of the way that you think about it, it's essentially a kind of a flexible layer one protocol, at least based on what I've read and heard you speak about, a layer one protocol that is essentially the aim is to optimize it, particularly for Defi applications. Talk a little bit about why you see an advantage there, how you're implementing that from a technology stack perspective, and also compare and contrast it a little bit to something like Ethereum, obviously a very widely known layer one protocol.
Speaker D: Sure. Yeah, no, absolutely. I think there's two things that you need to understand about the radix stack. The first is, if you want to, everything that we do on top of public ledgers inside of decentralized finance is all about assets and ownership of assets. But public ledgers like Ethereum, like Solana, like Avalanche, like any, anyone that you care to mention, the assets aren't a native function of the ledger. You have to program the concept of assets every time, which means that all of the interfaces aren't standardized. A simple example, I have a token in my wallet. I don't actually have a token in my wallet. The wallet is just a pointer to an address on the ledger. The ledger has no idea what it means to transfer one token from one address to another. That's a little computer program. Now all of that sounds very abstract, and it doesn't really come down to the user experience immediately, obviously. But if you make assets native to the ledger, that means that everything that interacts with them understands that they're interacting with assets. So now on radix, if I open up my wallet, I can see that my assets are in my wallet than they are actually in my wallet. They're not a pointer. And the assets tell me what I can do with them. They tell me if they're recallable, they tell me if they're freezable. They tell me if I can redeem them for whatever. I'm investing in an LP program.
Speaker C: How does that work, piers? Because it's really interesting to me, you mentioned, and I think the traditional understanding is that wallets are just a mechanism for seeing the pointer to the distributed ledger tell us how it would be different under the model of Radix.
Speaker D: Yeah. So the way that I normally describe it is when in the early days, when the games industry, the computer games industry, was first getting started, it was a cottage industry. And you got incredible prolific developers like John Carmack, who created Doom. But only a few people could do it because John Carmack had to actually build everything from scratch. He had to build the rendering engines, he has to build the physics engines. He had to build how the levels work and all of the artwork and how that then rendered on every single device. And it took the invention of an engine, in this case the games engine, to allow the computer games industry to go from a cottage industry to the biggest entertainment industry in the world. And what the games engine did is it went, look, there's a bunch of things that are standard about building games, right? There are physics, there is rendering, there is per ledger, sorry, per platform implementation. And what that did is it allowed easier development and easier and better user experiences of games. It meant games could be bigger and more complex. What Radix has got underneath our programming language and on the ledger is something called the Radix engine. And the Radix engine is like a game engine for finance. It basically gives you all of these primitives directly. Now, the wallet is still an interface, but now it's interfacing with a ledger where the things that you expect to be dealing with, like assets, like permissions, like accounts, like the ability to do recovery, they're all just, they're all the features of the underlying ledger. So you don't have competing standards, and you don't have to worry about whether or not this wallet or that asset will work with that DAP, or this asset will be able to be viewed in that wallet. It all happens completely by standard. So you take away all of the difficulty bits of creating standardized formats for things in code, an abstract level. But then for a computer programmer, and for a user, you end up with incredibly intuitive programming languages and incredibly intuitive user experiences. So your account on radix is actually an account. It isn't just a pointer, but it's a full smart contract that when you send tokens from one account to another, those tokens actually move to that account. And the alleged saying, okay, keeping the entry of these tokens, I know that peers, this account, that's Piers's account, owns these tokens. Not that there is a sub function on the ledger going, okay, I'm going to keep all of the addresses and all of the internal balances of this ERC 20 contract. But this ERC 20 contract over here was actually a scam one, but uses the same interfaces, can mean that if someone puts those tokens in their wallet, the person who created that contract is able to steal all of the tokens. You can't do any of that on Radix, because all of these are native functions and features. So the wallet leverages all of these features and creates this incredibly intuitive user experience. But the real power comes from this radix engine, the thing that allows you to have all of these standard functions and features, it directly built into the ledger itself.
Speaker C: Hey everyone, we're going to take a quick pause and hear a word from our partners. We'll be right back.

Book your stay today@lq.com. dot.
Speaker C: It'S a really interesting concept, a really interesting conversation. First, you mentioned the gaming industry is bigger than film and bigger than music. I know a lot of people over 40 probably don't realize that, but as global industries, it's just absolutely massive. Second point, you talk about this idea of what's generally termed abstraction layers. The idea that you can basically build layers of software on top of each other to integrate things. It's the reason that we have the Internet. It's the reason we're able to have this conversation right now on a very inexpensive equipment over standard Internet connections. And that's what really has been advancing decade after decade. And that got to a place where we could have things like bitcoin and ethereum and other protocols. You mentioned this idea of building this engine as an abstraction layer so that you have the ability to do logic and then to almost. I'm sort of reminded of the way that Steve Jobs talked about the integration between hardware and software. When you talk about the integration between the engine and the wallet, and the functionality that you can essentially call through that integrated system. Give us some examples, peers, about what that might look like in the real world. Some functionality from an end user perspective that the radix engine would enable when it goes live per your roadmap.
Speaker D: Sure. And you're absolutely right. Just a point on that. Right. The job of a protocol is to commoditize everything that everyone wants as standard, so that the job of the people who are building on it is only to innovate for the things that their customers care about, not to have to build anything other than that. And the full stack approach is very much of the Apple approach. We've gone from consensus, to the execution environment, to the programming language, to the wallet to create this full stack approach that as an end user means that you get this magically delicious user experience. To give you a concrete example, Kevin Rose got $1.4 million worth of his NFTS stolen from him. The reason that he got them stolen is because he was trying to transfer a bunch of nfts simultaneously. What happened is it came up and it said, would you like to approve this transaction? And because it was a complex transaction dealing with multiple smart contracts, it just came up as a hash. And this is called blind signing in metamask. And it's incredibly common. It's the most common way in which you approve any interaction on Ethereum or basically any other ledger as well. And I compare this to, like, a website, an ecommerce website, not having a shopping cartae, all you can do is you can go, I want to buy all of these things. You go, add to cart, add to cart, add to cart. But then you have to just press pay. You have no way of reviewing what was at what you actually about to do. And as a result of not being able to review the action, he then signed on a hardware wallet and submitted to the ledger. Someone was able to put a different command in place that he was unable to be able to work out that it was different. And then he signed it thinking that it was a correct command, and actually $1.4 million of his nfts were stolen. On Radix, we have this concept called the transaction manifest. And the transaction manifest is like adding a shopping cart back onto public ledgers. Now, the transaction manifest is a human readable list of all of the actions you're about to ask the ledger to do. And because assets are native features and accounts are native features and interfaces to dapps are native features, it doesn't matter how many dapps you're calling to, how many assets you're asking to do, how complex the number of steps are, you could literally say, I want to take this asset out of my wallet, put it into that, Dex. Take the result of that out, put that into a lending platform, take the result of that out, and then put that into my wallet. Right? And do that. And what you would see in the human readable transaction manifest is every single one of those steps. What you're going to get is assets in, what you expect to get as assets out, which dapps you're interacting with, and you sign it. And when you press approve, there is no way of getting in between that. And that is the crux of why people are not adopting crypto. In my opinion, the user experience of why people are not actually going and using metamask and using those wallets and instead going to intermediaries like Celsius is because they're so excited by the opportunity, but they're terrified by these user experience journeys that make it basically impossible for them to understand. And like you click that sign, you have no idea, and then you got to wait for like five minutes in terror as to whether or not it happens. And that gut wrenching, soul draining time. And on radix that goes completely with things like the transaction manifest, that's only possible as a result of the full stack approach.
Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's very well explained Piers, because oftentimes I think when we talk about this language that sounds like something out of a computer program, ui UX user journeys, sometimes it can sound to people like what we're talking about is like, no, it's. The shade of blue is ugly, it should really be purple. Like, no, this is really fundamental to the functionality. It essentially is an incredible opacity, a lack of transaction transparency of what's happening. And obviously Kevin Rose, a very sophisticated individual in the space. And when you read a story like that, I think it's very natural for people to have the reaction as boy, if this could happen to Kevin Rose, what chance do I stand? And I think that is something that's important to mention. Talking about things that are important to mention. I also wanted to take a look at the charts to talk about price performance here. If we bring up the radix chart, this is XRD, I think we're looking at Coinmarketcap here. First I wanted to show the one year chart, and then after that, if we could show the total chart, the all chart obviously appears, it's not a pretty chart for investors are not happy about this. Would you be able to comment on this at all? For people who listen to this conversation and they look at that chart and they just see the absolute devastation in.
Speaker D: Terms of price, sure, obviously we don't comment on price, but what I can talk about is the things that we look at, which is nothing to do with price. The things we look at is why I would call healthy growth. What are the things that actually matter for the long term success of a public ledger? And the things that matter are things like developer uptake. Since we launched our programming language scripto, specifically built for DeFi and web three, we've gone from zero to over 7300 developers trying our programming language and building within our community. We're seeing increasing week on week activity in our developer channels. We saw like 300 or 400 new developers each week for the last couple of weeks and we're seeing the trend of people going from just discussing about, hey, this is a cool program programming language to being like, okay, now I see the advantage that we get for building on Radix. We're going to focus on building on the public ledger. Now Radix took the unusual decision to launch our public ledger before smart contracts went onto it. So our public ledger went live. And because we're building the entire stack, we started with the consensus algorithm and the radix engine to make sure that that was tested before we added in the programming language for smart contracts and the user experience for the end user. And there's an 18 month gap between those two things because a, we wanted to build the security of the network and decentralize the staking of the network, decentralized this token holding the network. And b, we wanted to test and iterate our programming language and our state model before we put it live. Because one of the things that Vitalik from Ethereum always talks about, it's like we put solidity live too early. We wish that we could have changed some simple things about it that have caused massive amounts of complexity later. Because it is like shipping hardware. You ship this piece of public ledger code, your need to retain state and keep money secure outweighs everything else. So the ability to then iterate beyond that becomes very hard. So we took the strong decision of separating out the two launches and spending 18 months working with our developer community and getting the feedback that was necessary to make sure that when the public ledger went live, we had really nailed the programming experience and the state model for long term success of the public ledger. And that's what's coming in Q two of this year, and that's what we care about. We focus on that. And I challenge anyone to come into our developer community channels. They're all open on Discord and find a more enthusiastic and more serious developer community around the programming language anywhere else in crypto.
Speaker C: Piers, you talk about the tech side of this like you are very much a native of that land, but you actually have a very interesting background. Tell us a little bit about what you did about your educational background before you got into this space.
Speaker D: Yeah, I'm sort of like a mutt of education. That's the less nice way of saying polymath, I think. I think polymath is probably a loaded term. I originally went to university to do aerospace engineering, but I spent most of my first year launching my own businesses. They're all silly businesses, but I was like, I clearly want to do business more than I want to do engineering. So I changed my degree to Chinese in business because I was like, I don't want to just get a business degree. I should probably get something else as well.
Speaker C: Fluent in Mandarin.
Speaker D: Yeah. So, like, Rusty, I went and lived there for a year and a half, and I lived with China. Like, I didn't hang out with the foreigners. I went and lived with chinese people in, like, the chinese dorms and with chinese students, and it was hard, but it was great. And I. But I haven't practiced a lot recently. And then after you. And then in my final year of university, I did my CFA as well, at the same time as doing my final year of university, because I thought that finance was an interesting area. And then I had a job to go and work in law. Link laters put me through law school, and I went and did my GDL and my LPC, and then I accidentally.
Speaker C: For an american audience, GDL and LPC.
Speaker D: Yeah. So graduate diploma of law and legal practitioner certificate. These are the two things you need to be able to be a practicing lawyer. But while I was doing my law school, I created another company that ended up being an incredibly successful one, which was called Nifty, and that was a consumer electronics device company at the time, the highest funded uk tech Kickstarter project ever. And so I was like, I can't be a lawyer. I have to go and ship 15,000 units of this product around the world and set up an assembly line in China. So I flew to China and did that, and then I got that business running to about a million dollar run rate per annum, and my friend approached me and said, hey, you know, about engineering and electronics. I want to build some Ethereum mining rigs. There's this new thing called Ethereum, this new cryptocurrency called Ethereum. I want to start mining it when it goes live. And I was like, okay, what's cryptocurrency and what's mining? And that was my starting point, was building cryptocurrency, mining rigs, and it all went from there. But the thing that I think is really fascinating is that I did each of these things that felt like completely separate things, right? Like finance, law, like engineering, consumer electronics, or electronics. And suddenly it all came together in crypto. And I was like, man, this is my space. It's all of the things that I love, like, everything from, like, mathematics and game theory up to regulation and all of the weird kinks that come into it as a result of that, through to the financial aspects, the financial products that are being built on top of it. So, no, I'm not a computer programmer. I've just spent a long time building tech in different ways and I feel that this is my, like my, my special place, like crypto just makes me happy for so many reasons.
Speaker C: So, law degree, mandarin speaker, chartered financial analyst. Background in aeronautical engineering. As General Allenby said to te Lawrence and Lawrence of Arabia, you're an interesting man, no doubt about it. Obviously it gives you an interesting perspective on the space and it's fun to have you on, to have these conversations. Talking of which, I wanted to bring in Marco, who has some additional news flow on the defi side that we'd love to get your view on.
Speaker B: Sure.
Speaker E: Yeah, that's definitely an exciting background for peers. And so as we're talking about DeFi, these are some stories related to DeFi apps. So decrypt reports interesting data about the lending protocol. Aave, its latest upgrade, V three, launched earlier this month. It lists eight assets and has captured around $147 million in value. Ave CEO Stani Kulichev says the upgrade has security at its core. One of the features includes the ability to access liquid staking derivatives. The next story here is a Makerdao. So according to the Defiant, the second largest Defi platform, Makerdao managed to turn out a profit last year. That's despite a nearly 80% drop in operating earnings. Given the backdrop of a brutal crypto winter, that's definitely good to see. And finally, the story we covered yesterday, the same image of a fist bump and the word Monday appearing on many Twitter accounts of several defi platforms. Turns out it was a coordinated action to raise awareness about defi. Benzinga says more than 30 DeFi protocols shared their peers tweets to showcase the permissionless nature of defi. Obviously, this is something that I think is interesting. A lot of speculation going on. What are your thoughts, Ashley? Piers.
Speaker C: Piers, jump in. Lots of news. This is your space. You're a native.
Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So Aave, I think, is a necessary, necessary upgrade. The V three has been coming for a long time, but this ability to be able to silo or segment risk away from each other and also then be able to go, okay, well, as a result of being able to silo this, because one of the big problems with Aave is contagion risk. If you have a basket of assets where I can deposit any asset as collateral and withdraw any other asset as collateral, you've got to manage the volatility pairs between each of those. And if you have one bad asset in there, you basically create a drain on all of the other assets. So then being able to silo risk and saying, okay, well, what we're going to do is for these higher risk assets, we're going to contain the risks in what they can borrow. And that only gives one volatility side that you have to worry about, because they're only able to borrow in stablecoin. And this is going to mean that Aave is actually going to be able to offer a lot more assets for lending and borrowing. And I also think this is going to be really big part of their overriding strategy to release gho, their stablecoin. This is going to be another way in which they can find ways of printing money against collateral that gives them the ability to grow much more quickly without having to get depositors of externally of exogenous stablecoins like USDC or USDT. These are actually related, like Makerdao is related to this. The reason that Makerdao has made a profit is because of its ability to print stable coins against collateral. Like. So being able to make a profit on real world assets is because they can inherently print their own money. So if someone comes along and says, okay, I've got $20 million of loans on the book, and I have this risk profile, and I'll take first risk basis on it, and whatever the risk for makerdao is, just whether or not those assets are good, but if they believe they are, and they have a good risk profile for doing that, a good way of weighting the risk, and they pay attention to the circulating supply of DAi and make sure that there's not too much sell pressure around the dAI, because what a lot of these people are going to be doing is selling the dAI so that they can get us dollars, right. Then they have this ability, basically, to become a bank. They're a quasi lending institution that can print money, and that's why they're able to make a profit, and it's an incredibly good business model that they're going to be able to keep rolling out and get more mature at.
Speaker C: As someone who's a veteran of covering the 2007 2008 era, it seems as though the potential risk factor, or the sort of the piece of that stack that generates the risk is the underwriting component, the assessment of whether or not at what level you essentially value those assets. And the other point, and you mentioned just this at the top of your answer, there is the risk of contagion, where you see a generalized move from risk assets into higher value assets into a flight to quality as the term in the industry is. Talk a little bit about those two components of that risk stack.
Speaker D: Yeah, so that's exactly right. As soon as you start going into the real world asset stack, you start to have, you have to deal with real world risks and you're now moving into having to do risk modeling around those assets. And as with all modeling, as you know what your underlying assumptions are about the economic outlook of those assets have a massively important aspect to them. Now, I actually don't think this is the end state yet. I think the next thing that's going to happen is that credit default swaps are going to be in invented for real world assets on top of public ledgers. And then I think the real risk starts to come in because right now Makerdao risk committee is making the decision on the real world assets. What's actually likely to happen, I think, is that you're going to have credit default swaps against basket of real world assets so that you have a riskless rate. And that's where the real contagion is going to come in. When you have basically an immature market that doesn't really understand lending and borrowing, but is able to print money cheaply, that all of these lenders and borrowers are going to come in and go, give me a line of credit, which is already happening with Makerdao. I've been at conferences where people are talking about getting lines of credit from Makerdao. So this is where the industry is going to go. And you're right, it's a problem.
Speaker C: Yeah. And of course, there's no current way to very elegantly hedge that risk. And that's precisely the point that you make about credit default swaps. I wanted to bring Marco back into this conversation. I know we could probably talk about these issues for another hour, but Marco, I believe, has some viewer questions from our audience.
Speaker E: Yes, I do have quite a few, actually, viewer questions that we'll get to in just a moment. But first, for those watching on the real Vision website, thank you.

Hey, everyone, we're going to take another quick break and hear a word from our sponsors. We'll be right back to the real vision crypto daily briefing. All right, so onto some of these viewer questions, a lot of them coming from YouTube. So the first one here from name on YouTube, for how long does RDX works have funding for operating, operating costs? So I guess, for how long does RDX have funding for operating costs?
Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the RDX works is the development company behind the public ledger software. And then Radix Tokens Jersey is the entity that is essentially the regulated entity for the issuance of the token. It's Radix tokens jersey, which is the entity that is responsible for the long term funding of software development and stuff like that. But we haven't released any public statements about the long term funding of that entity. Apart from the fact that the public reserves of XRDEZ are known. When the public ledger was instantiated, Radix Tokens Jersey received 3.6 billion tokens, which is a market value of around $200 million at the moment.
Speaker E: And then the same person asked the follow up question, do they rely on selling XRD in order to fund operating costs or employee salaries?
Speaker D: Yeah, again, we don't comment on specifics like that.
Speaker E: Copy that. So another one from, I guess it's from name as well. Why does RDX works foundation currently hold 50% of the total supply? Doesn't it represent a security issue for the network? How decentralized is Radix, really?
Speaker D: Yeah, it's an interesting question as well. So some of those tokens are what we call the stablecoin reserve. So one of the long term perspectives of Radix was that stablecoins are incredibly important for public ledgers to be successful. And we created a reserve called the Stablecoin Reserve, which is 2.4 billion that's locked away and we don't have any access to it unless we decide to launch a stablecoin that's integrated into the radix ledger. That's actually quite a large percentage of the total holdings that we will burn if the network doesn't release a stablecoin. And if it does, then it becomes part of essentially a decentralized protocol that manages it. So there is a certain degree of trust for that period whilst we hold those tokens. But I think that the risk reward ratio of being able to launch something is systemically important on a network and making sure that if we don't, we burn them. I think that in the early stages of building a public ledger, you have to take some risks around what youre possible future build roadmap looks like versus how many tokens you hold, because there's a payoff ratio between those two things and there's still a lot to deliver for ADX.
Speaker E: Absolutely. So, I mean, I understand that, like, you guys are working towards that and as time goes on, you guys are working towards becoming more decentralized, is the way that I would take that answer.
Speaker D: Yes, exactly. Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: I mean, like the, we have specific targets for token holdings that we want to be below thresholds that everyone would be like, yeah, that sounds fair. And once we release Babylon, there's still a lot of work to do beyond that around Xi'an, which is the next release beyond that. So it's very much a work in progress. And I think that these kind of questions become a lot more fair when the network, when the major work of the network has been completed and you're now at a state where you're like, this is actually just a public good, and we're moving from a development phase to a maintenance phase where you're not adding massive features, you're tweaking and improving for the underlying stakeholders of the network and it's not there yet. So these kind of things are necessary to be able to get the network fully in motion.
Speaker E: This next question here comes from Chris Randall on YouTube. And this one's actually for Ash. It's a Genesis question. He asks any forecast on the valuation of convertible preferred stock to be issued by DCG. Last was 7 billion valuation in November 2021.
Speaker C: Chris, definitely no forecast for me. I'm not a financial analyst and I haven't had time to really read into it, but let me just give you a little bit of context here. DCG would exchange its existing $1.1 billion note, due in 2032, for convertible preferred stocks to be issued by DCG. This is per the press release, as part of chapter of the Genesis is a chapter eleven plan. Because it's only been announced, we'll probably have to wait a little longer, I think, to see some of the pricing forecasts. I'm generally not going to do pricing forecasts. In fact, I'm probably never going to do pricing forecasts. But what I would love to have is someone on the show who has the, who has the time and the bandwidth and the background to do that. I would love to interview someone, someone to talk about that pricing forecast. So it's going to be interesting and we're going to have to just wait and see what comes out next. But it's a great question, Chris, and I'd love to have someone on the show to talk about it.
Speaker E: Yeah, wait and see. And no pricing forecast until we have somebody to talk about it. Well, this next question comes from Lewis and company on YouTube. This is for peers. I want to ask if peers. I want to ask peers if Radix is going to launch a native stablecoin, algorithmic or collateralized, at Babylon launch. This is super. This isn't a super important topic, in my opinion, for a successful launch, is.
Speaker D: What he says is it? Is or is not a super important topic.
Speaker E: That's what he's saying.
Speaker D: This is a super important topic. Yes. So absolutely not is the answer. And the reason being is that everything that we do in Radix is staged for a combination of security and usability. Each layer is its own next level of foundation. You can't build the programmability layer until you have the execution and consensus layer. We built that 1st, 18 months later we then release the programmability layer and the user experience layer. Now you can't build a really great intrinsic application like a stablecoin without having the programmability layer in the user experience layer. But that only comes at Babylon. And it's certainly not something that we would rush out. Especially because stablecoins at the heart of any ledger, like we've seen with Terra, like we've seen with a number of other sort of like early stablecoins that didn't do so well. That's a really big risk systemically for the system. And it's something that we would want to take a lot of time and discussion around. And I don't think it's necessary for a public ledger to be successful in the early days. It's one of those things that may mean that you can grow a public ledger more quickly later because you have an easier way of being able to localize. But this isn't something that we're exploring for Babylon. And it's not anything that we're putting a timeline on. The only thing I'll say on this is we've given ourselves ten years to work out whether or not this is something we will do. And that we're now three years into that ten year period. And if we decide to not do it because it doesn't look like a good risk reward, then we'll burn the stablecoin reserve and the total supply will reduce.
Speaker E: Interesting. So this next question also for you peers, is from Percival on YouTube. Is there a plan for increasing the decentralization of XRD holder distribution that's been made available for the public to see.
Speaker D: Say that again.
Speaker E: He says, is there a plan for increasing the decentralization of XRD holder distribution that's been made available for the public to see?
Speaker D: Yeah, I think this is all related to the same questions around, like how much tokens the foundation has. And the answer is yes, it will be decentralized over time. Of course it will be. And each time we release a new piece of technology, it gives us more ways in which we can use those tokens to increase the user base, increase the developer base, increase the Dapps, make sure that it's actually being built for the benefit of the public ledger and that we're encouraging economic activity on the public ledger. These battles are going to be very long and very difficult for a public ledger to be successful. And I think a lot of people, when looking at token supplies, often are incredibly short term because why would you not be? If you're holding tokens and you want the token to make a return for you as quickly as possible, these are the things that feel like the easiest levers to pull in. The same way that you see people often asking for companies to return cash to investors. Ultimately, the success of these public ledgers rely on the economic success of the network of the people that are building on top of it. And that isn't a function of passive token holders, that's a function of active participation and making sure that that happens.
Speaker E: Yeah, and there's one more final question here from PBG, he says, or the person says, one subject you guys have not covered is the fact that you can't even get onto radix network without KYC, which is know your customer. Piers, do you have any comments on that?
Speaker D: Well, it's not true. The public ledger token is available on many exchanges, and you can move the token onto the ledger or buy the token directly or have it sent to you. The network itself is entirely permissionless. There is KYC AML on using a bridging service between the radix ledger and the Ethereum ledger, because there's no smart contracts on Radix. So you actually have to have someone take tokens in one side and then send them to you on the other. And because it's being done from Jersey, we have to abide by the rules of that jurisdiction. But if you want to get tokens directly from someone, there's nothing stopping you. Do that. It's a completely permissionless, decentralized ledger.
Speaker E: So directly from someone, meaning, I guess.
Speaker D: Peer to peer, essentially peer to peer or on a. You can buy it off Aussie swap or you can buy it off caviar. Both of these are decentralized exchanges that are already operating, and you can also buy it from various exchanges as well.
Speaker E: Copy that. Well, this is a great show, guys. I like to get your final thoughts and key takeaways. I would like to start, too. One of the interesting things that you mentioned, Piers, that just really stood out to me was this idea of human readable transaction. I believe that the human readable transaction list where you can, you know, because when you're signing a lot of this stuff on Metamask, sometimes you have no idea what you're doing. And essentially, the way that I understood it was that it would give you like a kind of essentially a summary or a description of what actually is happening. So that way you're making sure that you're making a good transaction. Right. That's one of the takeaways that I had, Piers. I don't know if you have any takeaways you'd like to leave with our audience.
Speaker D: Yeah, I think the main thing is, like the thing that the crypto industry needs to do is humanize crypto. Like right now, it is for the geeks and the hardcore anarchists, and it's not really for our friends, family and colleagues. It is, and our goal, if we want to make this mainstream, if we want web three and defy to be in every single person's pocket and to be a key part of how they're managed, their wealth and their identity and their access to things like the metaverse, you have to humanize it. You have to make the experience itself magically delicious. In the same way that people in the web two world work on doing that. And with Radix's tools, that's finally possible. With the Radix user experience, with the Radix wallet, with Radix programming stack, it is completely different. And it is now possible to make insanely great user and developer experiences, which we believe will lead to insanely great.
Speaker E: Dapps and applications taking it mainstream through user experience. I completely agree with that. Ash, what about you? Final thoughts, key takeaways for our viewers?
Speaker C: Insanely great. There's a Steve jobsism there, and I think it's probably a relevant metaphor, because the reality is, to date, that we have not seen the kind of adoption in the defi space. We've seen with the kinds of products that Steve Jobs made so famous at Apple. The idea of consumer products that people felt very comfortable with, they enjoyed to touch, that they enjoyed to interact with, that they had a kind of connection to. That's something that is still a challenge for the space and something that peers and other smart people are working toward attempting to solve. And I think it really is, in many ways, this whole show is emblematic of the kinds of conversations that are happening in this space. Look, I think there's a broad consensus. Well, let me not attribute it to anyone external. Let me just say it myself. I think that it's almost a certainty that we're going to see these types of technologies, specifically technologies that are increasingly decentralized, becoming a larger part of the financial services ecosystem and part of commerce and part of the, of the way we interact with social media, web, three, decentralized finance, defi. This is something that is definitely coming. Look, we're not endorsing radix. We don't endorse any particular protocol or token on this show. But these kinds of conversations, the conversation that you heard here today is really exploring the issue that we're going to be hearing about on some of our other financial services networks out there that you can get on your cable television, but you're going to be hearing about them there, maybe in one, maybe in three, maybe in five years. We're having this conversation today on real vision because these are the topics that are going to matter. These are the topics that are going to be part and parcel of this conversation, of how DeFi becomes mainstream, how DeFi becomes something that is integrated into our daily lives. Look, we don't know how long it's going to take. And the challenge with this, as we talked about earlier, the challenge always with price, is that there are these periods of irrational euphoria and then unbearable depression in terms of the way markets look at this. But I don't focus on price a great deal. We talk about the price action, obviously, because it matters to people. But to me, just speaking again, for myself, the most important thing is having these conversations that explore these ideas that are going to be the infrastructure, the architecture of the new decentralized financial services system that I believe is going to be coming to the world. It's just incredibly exciting. And I really enjoyed the conversation today with peers and a pleasure to do this again with you, Marco.
Speaker E: Yeah, it's always a pleasure to do this with you. And I think that you sum that up really perfectly. This is something that here a lot of us at real vision, I would say all of us at real vision believe is a secular trend, that it's not just the normal business cycle. We're going towards something much greater than that. And it's becoming integrated in so many parts of our, our daily lives. Anyways, with that said, I want to say, you know, to piers, thank you first for coming onto the show. It was a pleasure having you.
Speaker D: Thank you so much for having me. It was great to get to speak with both of you.
Speaker E: Yeah. We'll have to have you back on to update us on Radix, you know, later on this year when we can.
Speaker D: We'd love to. Thank you.
