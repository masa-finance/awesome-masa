It was 2014, where a friend of mine who had been active and I pre crypto digital assets, he had a company called Navio out of California. And to his credit, he had set up the first company that listed on Neuemark in Germany and Nasdaq. At the same time, he took everyone out for dinner in London, friends of his that he had pulled together while visiting from California, and said at the end of the dinner, the one thing I want you guys to do if you're friends of mine, is to basically go and buy some crypto. Go buy bitcoin. He very specifically said, go buy bitcoin. I don't care if you buy a dollar's worth $100, worth a million dollars worth, just go buy something. And that was our only task, which was a bit challenging at the end of a dinner and lots of wine when you're a bit of neighboring. But all of us having more or less managed to get something. And that's where the foray began, into the crypto space."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "I think there were three things that attracted to me. First of all, I'm sort of libertarian, so I do think that we should have control of our lives outside what the government has over us. Second, I do believe that currencies are highly manipulated. If you look at worldwide currencies and look at the post colonial, post second World war order, the reason why richer nations were able to keep access to resources and labor in poorer nations was through currency. You had a higher pricing power to a currency. And when that began to be sort of upended, because the gold standard that was there as a benchmark for currencies got to be challenged as Taiwan, West Germany and places like Bahrain started accumulating on the gold, well, the rules of the game got reset with the Bretton woods agreement. All of a sudden, you got linked GDP to. To your national currency, rather than gold reserves, which other countries had suddenly found a loophole through. So I do think there's a bit of what is really the subscription to a national currency, and is it really an even playing field? Why should the price of software vary from one country to the other in terms of the cost if the effort's the same? So I think somewhere it sort of resonated with me that you had a way of contributing value, because ultimately, currency is all about perception of value. What makes a $5 bill or a five pound note worth what it is, is because we believe it has a purchasing power of that value. So if we take it out of the national government and make it something that we all understand to be a common standard that's algorithmically driven, mathematically pure, well, that had a lot of appeal to me, so that's what got me into it. I must say that I thought it would take longer for the adoption purpose to take notes. Probably didn't buy as much as I could have or should have, but there you go. Hindsight's a great thing, but still glad to be on board. Since then, I've been an active participant in some ways since then."

The valuation in terms of the perception of what digital assets crypto are worth has fluctuated quite dramatically, obviously, in the past twelve months.

    },
    {
        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "So the thing about cryptocurrencies is because they are so multidimensional, right? Is it a, is it challenging gold? Yes, because it's becoming a unit of value. Is it challenging the predominance, the US dollar? Yes, because it's becoming in some ways an alternative to a global reserve currency. But it's also a software, right? It also has functionality, so it has various elements that are hard to cubbyhole. And I think because its so revolutionary and the fact that it challenges the status quo of fiat currencies and sovereign monetary policy, it does have these battles that shape out across the world that over time lead to their acceptance. But its only when national governments get to understand their potential and want to control it, realize they cant to some extent and in some extent they cant. So you're seeing that in a very hegelian way you have thesis and you have an antithesis. So you've seen this play out between the thesis of crypto as laid out by the Satoshi White paper on bitcoin white paper, to the antithesis by various governments and regulations trying to wrap their arms around that. We're in that flux. The US has taken arguably a step backwards with all the onslaught against crypto companies and cryptocurrencies specifically, whereas other parts of the world are getting more progressive. Europe's introduced mica, the markets and crypto assets you're seeing that adopted in terms of practice across the European Union. Hong Kong has just started allowing consumers first trading in bitcoin and fear by retail investors. Japan's making stable coins more acceptable. The UAE is becoming very progressive in terms of their virtual asset regime and what that lays out for for participants. So there's a bit of irregular rhythm across the world when it comes to acceptance. And I think that's really, really unfortunate because if you had a global standard, you would see the adoption of cryptocurrencies perhaps the same way you saw them as in the mobile space where you saw an adoption of the global standard for mobile, for GSM that then made it much more ubiquitous in terms of the rules and the participants that want to play by the rules."

I think the US has fallen a bit short. While there's attempts to make legislation and get them passed through the Congress and Senate, they've not been that effective so far. What's happened instead is a bit of legislation by enforcement, and that's not a good thing, especially because the world looks at the US as being the leader for free thinking and innovation and free enterprise. So we sit outside the US and wonder what happened to change that ethos and rhythm that was so envied by the world. And I think that's a bit unfortunate, at least in the current state of play."

Obviously, web one built right here in the United States, a partnership, public and private, between the government, industry and of course the universities in the early days. Web two, enormously beneficial to the United States. What's your thought on the trajectory that this might take in the United States in terms of web three? How does that interface with the rest of the world? Obviously the United States, the world's largest economy, but still a small part of the overall pie. It's interesting to see how this infrastructure gets built out when the United States has been the global reserve currency for so many decades and yet is now. I think it's reasonable to say, not in the poll position, not in the driver's seat, something of a laggard in terms of the development of digital assets."

        "text": "I was having this conversation with multiple people here. I met this alpha summit, which is a group of early adopters in crypto, and a lot of them are from the states and some of them are from outside. So you get a multiple study of views. I think that the US has in the past been the great commercializer of innovation. So you think about Tim Berners Lee inventing the web link and the World Wide web as we know it, CERN Institute out of Switzerland being very important in terms of propagating it. But the real liftoff took place when companies like Amazon and Yahoo and eBay, and later on, of course, Google and the meta companies basically went out there to make everyday lives better by adopting this new innovation. And I think the way taxation was, was treated for e commerce companies through legislation made that free enterprise move very palatable and very acceptable. And therefore you saw great companies being built on the back of that, on the flip side, you have experiences where my friend who I referred to earlier, the reason why his company was able to listen to Nimark and Nasdaq concurrently, and why it was successful, is because the US had restrictions on the export of encryption technologies. They were treated as ordinance under us law. So guess what? That created an opportunity for companies outside the US. You saw the same thing happen, for example, in stem cell research some years ago, and arguably over the CDMA and GSM war. It wasn't chodi legislation, but there was a bit of protectionism around the CDMA technology that ultimately led to them sort of coming to an agreement of how they should propagate a common standard. I do hope that the US learns from that e commerce experience and doesn't go down the path of the stem cell experience or certain other technologies like encryption exports, which really held things back, because the powerhouse of the US, of the world economy still remains the US. So you look at Ripple, which recently won a ruling. Well, talking to some people earlier at the Paris blockchain week in March of this year, the people involved there said 90% of their business in Ripple was outside the US, which is, again, a bit unfortunate considering that they were living in the US."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "Sure. So we're building effectively an asset management firm with global aspirations. And we have two sides of the house. So on the one side, we want to get liquid securities that people can tap into to get exposure to digital assets. On the other hand, it's illiquid securities and tokens. So if I take the first one first, the institutional investor wants to buy products they understand where they have transparency, they have oversight regulations that usually comes in the form of a traded security. And you've seen right now about 162 listed exchange traded funds, or exchange traded notes that basically are an equity or debt security collateralized by an underlying holding in crypto. So we want to follow the same path because we know there's a lot of appetite amongst institutional investors to get exposed to the asset class, but they'd rather do it through the familiarity of the traded security. So we're pushing out some exchange traded notes in Europe which will have collateral of single currency coins that are innovating. We're innovating in that space by bringing DeFi generated yield in addition to staking yield. So you get one coin in an exchange rated note. Those coins are deployed in DeFi protocols to propagate the DeFi ecosystem, to propagate support for new Dapps on that ecosystem. And these are also propensities by certain coins to promote the ZK, the zero knowledge frameworks that they have for the DeFi ecosystem. We are effectively creating yield that gets passed on to the node folders from a combination of staking and deFi, therefore allowing for fiat currency participation in the digital asset space, and helping the digital asset space ecosystem being supported by this influx of capital, that then propagates new dapps and new developments on Deepak protocols. That's an innovation we're bringing, hopefully during the course of this year, by listing a few notes that have underlying digital assets. With the Defi yield generation separate to that, we're looking at private companies, and we already have investments, for example, in a company out of La called Wave digital assets, now a top five, I might add, regulated asset manager there in RIA, and a billion and a half of AUM. And we're proud shareholders in there again, they've been phenomenal at building out this whole digital asset space, as well as ideal colab out of San Francisco, which is a fund from the very well known design shop called Idea, which designed the mouse for Steve Jobs and the fun faction toothpaste for Colgate. Apparently, every surfer knows them, should be looking at surfers behind me. And through that, we've also co invested in deals that the fund has invested in. So we're continuing with that thesis. We just have made some investments in Switzerland that are promising, and we will look at the ones that are breakout success and then add more to it. And that'll take the form of a more structured venture fund as opposed to piecemeal investments we've done over the balance sheet the past few years. We're calling that fund glass Ventures. The last thing we're doing, which is again, in the same space of private companies and tokens, is we're creating a metaverse record label, which effectively will allow for private participation and the title ownership of music tracks. If you think of music tracks that are, say, owned by record companies, well, there's no reason why you can't tokenize part of the ownership, let's say 20 or 30% of the ownership, which is then owned by people at large, particularly fans of specific artists who they support. They'd love to also be benefiting from the economics. So we will effectively find a way of token offerings for title ownership of music tracks. So you could own, for example, 1% of a song by your favorite artist, and therefore have bragging rights because you're a co owner in a cool song. You also have secondary sale possibilities where you could sell your token. And the reason why that second retail is possible is because the tokens have intrinsic value in the form of royalty payment. You're basically a co owner. So anytime the song is played and there's a royalty generation, you're going to get a proportion of that that you're entitled to. So you get a 20 year income stream that you can basically sell on a four basis as a secondary sale of your tokenization. Of course, we're looking at jews in a very compliant, regulated way. So wherever these tokens that will ultimately be security tokens will be created. We'll listen there. We've got some phenomenal content that will be very exciting when we put out for very exclusive tracks from very sought after top tier artists in the world."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "So, if you think of the existing ETF's. So ETF's are basically funds, and they have a diversity of underlying investments. ETNs can have a single asset underneath them. So you can have one single token. Those tokens are exposed to different protocols, right? So you use them, for example, in staking pools to generate yield. And staking. Now, most of the early ETF's that were listed were basically non yield generating. You followed the movement of the price, and if the price of your underlying token went up well, you got an increase in value. So it was a capital appreciation play. Some later plays got yield generated, for example, by a cover call option strategy. So you took a long only position on where the likely price would be over a 30 day cycle, usually month end. And you didn't get the full upside of a price movement. You didn't get the full downside, but you got some generation of yield. By capitalizing on the volatility and creating that, you had the next generation of ETF's that then gave yields from staking pools. And that's been good, that's been successful, but the yields are limited. And while that might have worked, let's say in 2021, even 2022, what's happened, as you and I are aware from our credit cards and mortgage prices, is that interest rates have gone up. So, for investors to get a yield that's now above market, when you can get healthy yields on TiVo, for example, you have to have an above market generation of yield. And that's not going to come purely from staking. That's going to come from the deployment of coins on DeFi protocols, where through liquidity provisioning to yield farming, you effectively can get a higher yield. And you allocate a certain number of your overall tokens to that DeFi protocol, let's say 25 or 30% with an above, like you get 20% and north yields from there, you blend that with your staking yields because they sub 6% and you get a blended yield of the high single digits that is very appealing to the market. It's reasonably attractive for institutions because they can see above market yield, and they can also see potential appreciation of the token values themselves over a twelve months to three year period, which is a holding pattern for them. So we're giving them the best of both worlds. They're coming into the market, which is a bear market, to get lower prices of tokenization, but they're also getting a yield, no matter what the price does, because we're getting an enhanced yield from a combination of staking and DeFi deployment. And that is the innovation we're bringing. Because I think you and I will both sort of understand that DeFi is pretty much here to stay, and few institutions have access to that in a way that's safe and through a regulated instrument, like a stock exchange created care or no."

And yet I and yet with DeFi, we know that there have been a series of notorious security exploits, vulnerabilities, flash loan exposures. Right now, today, this morning, breaking curve finance drained of $50 million, I think $100 million of tokens, potentially at stake, CRV token off some 12% in trading.

So you can actually look at where they deploy, the liquidity there, the backing that they have, and you want to find Defi protocols that have been around for a while and have hopefully saved off any hacking attempts. For the most part, it's not the currencies themselves, but it's the bridges that get attacked. If you think about, it's not the bank itself, but it's the truck that's used, the armored truck that's used to transport the cash in and out, that's what's attacked. So there's always risk in doing everything right. So even as we speak now, the estimate for cryptocurrency hacking and fraud in 2022 was about $3.8 billion, some of it argued to be sponsored by some state governments like North Korea, which have been fairly well documented. But at the same time, the fraud that took place in the UK alone that year was about a billion and a half us dollars. That's just in the UK. So on a global basis, the amount of fraud that takes place in the regular banking system on credit card fraud far exceeds what you see in these piecemeal ones that take place in the digital asset world. The issue is that because it's newer and it's less known, the fear is greater. And of course the publicity generates is far greater because it's new.

        "text": "No, you're absolutely right. On a proportionate basis, the amount that takes place in the digital world will exceed what takes place in traditional finance world. But this is also a very nascent industry. I'm sure if you went back in time, you looked at bankruptcy took place in California in the early days of the gold record, probably too far off in terms of the proportion that was there in the banking system. The point is, this is something that the industry is collectively looking to tackle, even in the specific instance that you mentioned, the wiper code base that was attacked was an earlier generation of that coding. The newer iterations of the same software have addressed some of those loopholes and they have tried to close off some of these open entry points for hackers that apparently who spent like weeks and months trying to find vulnerabilities that they could exploit. So, you know, we will be extremely careful. We will also not risk everything there. That's why I mentioned the proportionality of 2025 30% in that range, or what we'll deploy in the D five protocols, while the bulk of it will be arguably a safer staking pool network that we are much more accustomed to. But if you go back to staking pools too, you go back five years, they were not that dissimilar to what is taking place today in the DeFi world. Right. If you go back even further, look at Mount GoC or some other hacks, these things took places, Dexs were attacked, like in this case here, with curve in a manner that then forced industry to find fortifications against such hacks. So we want to ride that growth and be part of that change. At the same time, we certainly dont want to be exposing investors to vulnerabilities that they should not be, because we're not being rigorous about it."

What we're seeing, evolving models, including things, for example in smart nfts, where AI is making the nfts a lot more malleable, a lot more cognitive in terms of what they allow for users to experience, and therefore have greater functionality. And the one thing I think is coming out over the next twelve months is greater functionality, greater everyday utilizations and use case scenarios, for example, Starbucks vouchers with polygons protocols. That's something that's hidden behind you don't see it, but in everyday use, there's a real world application for a blockchain technology that's very efficient. So I think the next twelve months we'll start seeing more of the permutations and combinations come out of blockchain technologies meshing with both other technologies and real world applications. And that should lead to a shift in the mindset of what the everyday use cases for blockchain. That's been somewhat of a question mark for some people by 2024.
