And these are really important questions. And weve covered it from many angles, from commodities to macro to economists, giving everybodys view. Now, if you remember in the beginning, I kicked this whole thing off with my thesis. And one of core parts of my thesis is that Im bullish. I do expect volatility. I dont think things go up in a straight line, but Im generally more bullish than most. And Im very bullish on technology and extremely bullish on crypto. So I really wanted to get Beth kindig on. She was the girl who nailed it for Nvidia on real vision. She's done extraordinarily well in predicting and forecasting tech. And I really want to get her ideas of how to play this and figure out does she think it's a boom or a bust? Join me, Raoul Pell, as I go on a journey of discovery through the macro, crypto and exponential age landscapes. In the journeyman, I talk to the smartest people in the world so we can all become smarter together. Beth, fantastic to get you back on real vision."

        "text": "So ten years ago, actually about 13 years ago now, I landed in Silicon Valley and I was positioned called a tech evangelist or developer advocate, which means that you package product and you describe the products to a technical audience, and they then hopefully adopt your platform. Or another use of this role is mergers, acquisitions, and very large eight to nine figure partnerships. So let's say a company is going to choose a mobile application security company. How do they go through dozens of mobile application security vendors and choose which one to move forward with, again, for an eight figure, potentially nine figure vendor, um, partnership. So essentially, uh, I was doing that for six or seven years, and it was brought to my attention that where that competitive analysis would be very valuable would be the public market. So to give you an idea, within three years I was on the largest stages in Silicon Valley. I was presenting at Black Hat games, beat, uh, Tech Week Chicago, uh, multiple conferences, basically throughout the Silicon Valley and other areas such as New York, advertising Week, New York, those kinds of places. And I was getting press because of the ability to basically say, out of all of these cybersecurity vendors, I'm just giving you one example of a project I worked on. This is the one that has the most cutting edge technology that will give you a competitive advantage. Well, this happens to be very useful for public market investors who need to first and foremost navigate the competitive landscape. There are so many products on the market, it's very hard to sift through how those products, you know, what is the competitive advantage of those products, but then also which ones are most likely to succeed. So in 2018, I began to write for the public markets, and it started to go very well right away. One of my first articles that I ever wrote in 2018 was that Nvidia had two impenetrable moats. One was the GPU powered cloud, and the other was CuDa, and that they would become an AI powerhouse. And I repeated that publicly for years on tier one media podcast, things that are recorded and archived. And then another one was that Microsoft Azure, which at the time was nothing, getting much attention, would compete alongside AWS due to hybrid cloud computing and their inroads to enterprise. These are just some examples of some of the very first work I did for the public markets. So once all of that started to materialize, you know, it was encouraged that I launch a research site, which is fast forward, where I'm at today. I've had a research site for 45 years. We've been audited through a third party accounting firm, large one in San Francisco, and our results far exceed, basically, most other ETF's or tech portfolios, particularly around the fact that I do know tech and that my skillset is how do you sift through all of these products on the market and recommend only one and make sure that that one that you've recommended performs in the future?"

        "text": "I do agree with the sematic investing approach. It's very venture capitalist inspired. And because I was in the private market, that is an excellent way to begin. I think where the problem is with some of the more thematic investing is that there's not enough granularity, again into, number one, the competitive space or the competitive analysis. Number two, the fundamentals, especially right now, need to be very, very clean and very straightforward. Those are a couple of things that we look at. And then third would be risk management. So within something like AI, which again weve talked about for five years, we had a 45% allocation to AI going into this year. People are talking up Stanley drunken Miller for 29%, which is great. But just to give you an idea as to how patient we have been in building this, but at the same time, every AI stock that ive owned going into this year had an excellent bottom line. And so I dont give tech companies any leniency around the fact that they have to be a really solid business as well. And then, of course, making sure that theyre on track with their product roadmap, that they're not over promising under delivering. There's all kinds of flags to watch out for. But then, of course, tech is by far the world's most valuable industry, so it's well worth the effort."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yes, although I will say that overall, where we will pick a theme. So a great example, I guess, if we could all travel back in time, would be mobile. And I'll tie this into how I look at things today. If you could go back in time around 2010 and pick a tech portfolio, there's no reason to own anything but mobile. Mobile gave us the native application of Facebook, which is when Facebook exploded. It gave us a search engine, Google Maps, in our pocket. Google exploded at that time. Of course, Apple is mobile, so there's no reason to go looking around and spread yourself too thin here, because mobile was the place to be. Now, within mobile, like, how do you find those big winners? So for us, it's AI. And that sounds very buzzword today, but I do want to just reiterate, this has been a thesis of ours for many years, on record, archived. Um, but within that, this is, in, you know, my humble opinion here, uh, the number one investment opportunity of our lifetimes. Um, you know, the generation before us, their lifetime, the generation after us. This is an enormous opportunity, and there's nowhere else to invest right now. In my opinion, we do add some diversification, but it's like I said, we had 45% AI exposure going into this year. When we look at pullbacks, our plan and strategy is to continue to build AI."

This nexus where AI is almost a foundational layer now on top, and everything gets built on top of it. Like you, I think it's a cambrian moment. I think that the generative AI that's going on right now is as big a breakthrough as we've almost ever had. Maybe along with. I know it sounds ridiculous, but along with the splitting of the atom, this kind of creating infinite knowledge is something that we can't even yet get our heads around. And it ties into everything. People just think of it as chat, GPT, or a few things, but it's not. I mean, it's literally going to power our world. How do you think of AI in the broader perspective?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "So one thing that I boil it down to, I guess, is that the impact it will have on GDP as what you're describing is unlike any technology in modern times, and it's because it will drive down costs, increase productivity. So the contribution there is infinitely higher than something like mobile. And the reason I anchor a lot back to mobile is because we all know that the faangs, if you could have invested 1015 years ago in the fangs, you would have. So what I'm describing is four to five x larger than the fangs. Um, so, of course what we're going to do, what will be the result, is some massive winners. Um, just like I would call the fangs, massive winners within mobile. And AI will blow mobile, you know, away in terms of it's not only contribution to GDP, but, uh, you have a $15 trillion market. Mobile was about a four to $5 trillion market immediately right out the gate. Today, we have three x, but I think that that's very low because it's not incorporating all of the software innovation that we can't even imagine yet. But given the numbers we have today, uh, because people like to think of AI as a hype. What I would encourage people to realize is that, um, in 2010, mobile was not a hype. And we're probably more like 2008 or 2009 right now in terms of where we are with the vintage of AI, in terms of where it's going to go. So just keep all that in mind that if you believe that mobile would have been the right way to position, then AI certainly will be, because it's so much more massive in terms of its contribution and size."

But what we're seeing is AI just fits over existing rails. So the growth of AI is staggering. I mean, we saw the zero to 100 million chat GPT, I think it was six weeks. We've never seen the technological adoption of this speed before."

        "speaker": "D",

And then, of course, some of these other projects, OpenAI, DeepMind, obviously they're very instrumental. But for the public markets, Nvidia has really provided the h 100, which cannot be overstated in terms of its importance for where, how quickly AI is growing right now."

        "text": "Yeah, lets talk about some of these stocks. So Nvidia, obviously, its moved a lot fast. How can you think about this stock in the future? How do you discount some of this? How do you figure out who else could walk into this market eventually? Because obviously theyve got such a stranglehold on everything right now and there's such a backlog of chip orders. But how do you, how do, how do people even get to grips with Nvidia right now? Or should they just not and wait for some sort of correction or wait for something to lean into?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "We are a very big fan of waiting for corrections. One of the best things we did was not only recommend Nvidia to your, to your subscribers in January, but we actually bought in October at the low, and we issue real time trade alerts. So all of this is in real time and it's on the thousands of people's phones. So, uh, all very proven. And we bought at the October low because we were very patient. Uh, we are watching this to determine as well. Like you said, you just add, you just close your eyes and add. Or should we be a little bit more patient? Wait for that pullback? I think it also helps to put into context just why Nvidia is so important, which is, I. I would almost say their real AI moment was actually a couple years ago with the A 100, because they combined inference and training onto one chip. But now the H 100, the reason why, to me, that was their AI moment. That was when a lot of their R and D and a lot of their success, basically, and their product releases were now cornering a market. And then the H 100 has now opened up such an ecosystem of software development that it's a very special moment in time. People do call it the iPhone moment. I agree with that because of the development that can now occur. And a lot of it is not only that it greatly increased performance, but it has a transformer engine, and that gets rid of having to label datasets. So you can basically find patterns mathematically. And that piece is why so many large language models are now coming to market. The T and GPT is for transformer. And so it's just this opening up of so much innovation. And you can actually train a model with a transformer engine in basically a day, which greatly reduces the time compared to what was available before. So it was a massive drop within the AI community and ecosystem in terms of where you can go now. And that's why I think there was so much excitement. But like you said, how do you pick the next winners? And I think that's where we're entirely focused right now, is being very patient and building out this AI portfolio."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yes, I have. And what I would say is one of the proxies we used about two years ago or three years ago was watching big tech capex, which, um, was growing very fast and was leading to basically down the funnel to Nvidia. And then we've, if you sit on these calls with big tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, they're all talking about allocating more and more of their capex towards AI acceleration. So for me, like, you know, this, these are verifiable budgets. This is Capex. It's very easy to go look at these financials of big tech. All these management teams are basically saying, we're just trying to buy as many GPU's as we can possibly buy right now from Nvidia. When I heard it and it came across my desk, my first thought was, well, we, we can track where their orders are coming from. They're coming from big tech capex, and it's been a strong proxy to use for Nvidia success for the last couple of years. So I don't buy it in terms of there being, you know, what's driving these sales compared to AWS, Azure, meta's ambitions. And I'm leaving out Google cloud."

I remember speaking to Ahmed Mostak from stability AI, and, you know, he was just talking about, I mean, they're melting GPU's, people are driving them so hard and having to order so many. He got me into the idea of Nvidia a while ago just by saying, listen, it's a bottleneck. Everybody has to go through that pipe right now. There's no other way around it. So it feels like, do you think that changes over time, or is that the one play for that particular space? And then we look at layering out the bet elsewhere in the space."

        "text": "It's like Apple, though, which is that there will be an Android. And so we think the Android will be AMD. And we have a large position in AMD because of, we think it'll be very strong contender. I like to call it the dark horse, which is an underestimated competitor that comes out of nowhere. I like to give stocks nicknames, but I think it's a dark horse because it was with intel. And if you look through what happened with intel, it's mind blowing. And the media has never appropriately reported on this, in my opinion. And it's important to understand how AMD took market share from intel because they have this experience of taking on the 800 pound gorilla, and now they're going to take that exact same strategy and they're going to bring it to Nvidia. So for me, I prefer not to choose. We have a very large position in Nvidia and a large position in AMD, and I hope they both win. But just going back to some of how AMD competed with intel was all on design, all on architecture. They basically combined a seven nanometer chiplet with a 14 nanometer that allows the chip to use whatever is needed most at that time. It's called the multi chip module. And they also beat intel and memory bandwidth. Just very power efficient. And then they put them in a headlock, if you will, if you're thinking of like a WWF match by lowering the price. And it became a virtuous cycle because they came in with a more powerful chip, a more unique design that was able to be power efficient because it used the seven nanometer when it was needed, flipped back to the 14 nanometer when it wasnt needed. And that multi chip module design was not only superior on performance and power efficiency, but it came in at half the price. And what does that mean? It means you can just load up and buy more cpu's. It was really the Zen two architecture. And they went from when we first covered AMD 4% data center share to now going into the 30%. Just a phenomenal comeback from Lisa Hsu. So the reason that I think this is getting very exciting because Mi 300 will come out towards the second half of this year, is because her and her team are coming at it again with an interesting architecture, which is a shared coherent memory. The big headline around the Mi 300 is that they were able to run the Falcon. It's like a 40 billion parameter, large language model. They were able to run that entirely in memory, so they didn't need to go back and forth with the external memory. That was really interesting because it's bringing the heat on Nvidia in terms of just pure hardware, where AMD has a lot of work to do. Just to be really clear, Nvidia's H 100 is a marvel of innovation. This thing is incredible. If you hear Jensen Wang on these earnings calls, he'll describe how they make it a huge piece of equipment and there's tons of software pieces, and it takes a robot to build. AMD can compete on hardware, though. And they are running the world's largest supercomputer right now, and they're launching the next largest supercomputer. So it's the El Capitan, the fastest computer in the world is run on Amddeendeh. But where they struggle is the software development platform. So Rockm is an open source development platform that is hoping to compete with Cuda. And it is very unlikely to have the entry that this is where, let me just rephrase it. This is where the friction can be, because software developers have learned Nvidia's Cuda. So it's more of the software side that I think AMD has work to do. So we'll see how that goes. But those are some of the bullet points on why I'm bullish on AMD with a caveat that we have to watch how successful the open source development platform Rockem is."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, Taiwan semi is really the only fab in the world foundry in the world that can produce these advanced nodes. So when you talk about this bottleneck, a lot of the bottleneck also occurs around Taiwan semi. And there's so much geopolitical implications to Taiwan semi that this is just the world of semiconductors that some people choose to just go towards software, but it hurting you to go to software because AI is being innovated at the hardware level. But we actually have a small position in Taiwan semi too, because it clearly all roads lead to Taiwan semiconductor with the five nanometer, four nanometer, three nanometer. The sooner that Taiwan semi can get on the United States soil, probably the better. But overall, the bottleneck that you've spoken of is also occurring there."
    },

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So let's go further up the food chain. Okay. The applications layer of this stuff, where do the big players, Google, Microsoft, Apple, how do they all fit into this architecture? If Taiwan semi is the kind of not Taiwan semi, if Nvidia is kind of the epicenter of this revolution right now, Taiwan semis, like at the foundational layer, because nobody can do anything without them, then we've got the big guys with their large language models and what they're trying to roll out across all of their various applications. How are you thinking through the big players?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yes. So I would say that is also one of the best questions to talk about, because AI will test tech investors, because tech investors have gotten comfortable with almost the opposite. Because mobile is so consumer driven, AI will be very enterprise driven, because the most immediate impact that AI will have is driving down costs, increasing productivity for enterprises. There will, of course, be some consumer overlay, but what is really ideal for a stock or for a company is if you take a consumer facing company like Google, and they can inject their AI technology into the ads machine or their Google search so they don't have to go out and go try to get lots of consumers to adopt something new. Consumers will simply continue to use search, it'll just be improved search, advertisers will continue to use Google, it'll just be improved ROI, easier to find your targeted audience. So those pieces are really important because in the past, these innovation cycles such as mobile were more democratized. So anyone could really create a mobile app. There were millions of mobile apps, anyone could create a website. There were hundreds of millions, I suppose, of websites. But where will we actually, where's the product market fit? Where's the market for AI? And that's where I think big Tech has a serious undeniable advantage here, which is that they are not going to create an app and go run around and try to make people adopt it. Obviously chat GPT was fun and interesting, but Google doesn't really need that. They can simply improve their own ad machine and their own search engine as is not have to change behavior. Microsoft is a very interesting company across all big tech because of its connections with enterprise. So if you're going to drive down costs, increase productivity, who's sitting there? Best to do that would be Microsoft's suite of cloud products. So again, rather than going out and saying brand new, everybody adopt this copilot, we're just gonna, we're just gonna add this to Office 365 and integrate that into our product suite. So there's that friction that I think will be very real for startups or other smaller companies, which is how do you get people to adopt AI is not such a problem for big tech because they have the perfect product suite of to just bolt that on, improve the revenues they already have from the customers they already have. And so those are some of the things that are really important. And then of course, another piece about Microsoft that a lot of people overlook is that that investment, open AI, basically because those APIs are run on Azure, there is a nice funnel, or Azure is downstream from all OpenAI APIs. The more the OpenAI is successful, the more azure will be successful from some of that usage. There's certainly some nice connections there as well."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, big data and analytics, huge need, what I will say. So the exponential rise of data for our portfolio purposes, just to be super transparent, we don't think it's time just yet to build those positions. We're getting very close. If you listen to some of these big data analytics earnings calls, they'll be quite clear. They don't have AI revenue yet, although they're situated really for AI. And one of those reasons, um, if I will, is that big tech is the biggest producer of AI right now. Um, so, uh, you know, like we just talked about, um, and, and they have a lot of their own big data and analytics products and platforms. They don't necessarily use a snowflake or a MongoDB within their own systems, so they have their own already. What you would need is, you know, startups and smaller enterprises, you know, s and B's, whatever, all along those sizes of companies to really explode on the AI trend before the public stocks today are really seeing that new trajectory. And that's why Nvidia had this crazy, you know, 200% growth and data center is because their chips are right here, right now, in extremely high demand. So in my opinion, when big data and analytics layer is ready to pop, I don't hope it'll go up 200%, but you'll see a very strong inflection point at that moment. And we don't have that inflection point yet. So I'm trying to be a little more patient. I'm wondering if we'll get one of those big sell offs that tech, like. Tech, loves to have. Massive sell offs. So I like to have a couple ideas in my pocket for when those sell offs come down the line. Big data and analytics is not something I have in the portfolio right now. Certainly these will be needed, especially the more different types of data for machine learning models. But if you look at some of the snowflakes, the confluent, the MongodB's, we're not seeing that inflection point yet, and I don't think we will until AI broadens away from big tech."

He's like, yeah, the compute side is pretty hard, and it's a fight for GPU's, and we have to develop our own hardware, etcetera. He goes, nobody thinks for how expensive and difficult it is to store all this bloody stuff.

So whether it's the auto oems, or whether it's the autonomous driving systems, or whether it's a Nvidia which to me is a very hard competitor right now, would be Nvidia with Dojo or automotive. Nvidia's proposal, and it's right now being adopted across companies like Mercedes, is that they're the autonomous system in the vehicle. So where Tesla is very innovative, very cutting edge at the forefront, where I would be cautious is, are they just going to be running too thin across too many fairly decent competitors? I think Tesla gets a lot of attention, but I wouldn't count Waymo out. I wouldn't count Mobileye out. I think Nvidia is very hard to beat with, because while Tesla has all of the real life data, what Nvidia has is the simulation. So what they do is they run their vehicle, they run vehicles and simulation to collect data. And those simulators are running all night, all day, basically training robots. So what I'm trying to say is that it would be much ideal to me if they were more of a pure play and they let go of, like, dojo entirely, or I just like a lot of focus.

It's much more like a large language model, deals with stuff, and I just think it's a very interesting approach. The other thing that I find very interesting about Tesla is because it shows the way of the integration of AI and robotics. That's really what a Tesla car is. And I think people are underestimating that the integration of AI with machines, people think of it still as like an enterprise b, two b thing, or as a consumer application, but it's going to drive everything from your fridge to your car to the plane you go into, almost every single thing. And that's the robotics revolution starting to happen."

I guess if I were to say a near term trend for AI, I'm really liking cybersecurity, basically because these are agentless systems. And if you think about cyber attacks, they're obviously coming, you know, brute force attacks and whatnot. They're coming from computers. So what would be the best way to find these anomalies? And the threat detection would be another computer. And so for me, that, and then, of course, course, if you can come in and replace fairly high paying, you know, high salaried security professionals but do the job better, I think we're going to see that inflection point a little bit faster. I'm just coming off the top of my head as to what would be more near term. And so I'm more focused probably on cybersecurity and AI right now. I don't have exposure yet, but we're in a deep process of researching to find that right company because there's actually so many strong contenders in cybersecurity. Microsoft actually is one of them. But best of breed, these are companies with some of the better bottom lines. They are, you know, they've weathered the COVID pull forward. They kept growing more than other cloud. So, you know, for me, I guess if I were to say robotics would probably be too far into the future due to that need to perform as a portfolio. But I think cybersecurity could potentially be a very big theme for 2024."

You just don't need a bunch of people doing hypothesis testing and writing papers when you can do things at such ridiculous scale and speed. By using AI in that process, stuff like the human genome stuff just becomes very easy to deal with."

I think most people avoid them, and this is beyond advantageous or AMD, but small cap semiconductors or those that might be even more two, three years out on AI, custom silicon, things like that. I really enjoy that space for a couple of reasons. One is that the prediction is that 50% of the AI economy will be captured by semis. That compares to about 2010% to 20% on previous tech waves. So your mobile, your Internet. So I think that there's a material reason as to why to focus on them, and then I think most people avoid them. So we happen to have an edge there. So even within automotive, I like the semiconductors quite a bit. Within AI, even beyond GPU's, there's other ways to look at semiconductors overall, for the most part. I think the last, like I said, the last ten years has really been characterized by consumer. A lot of the big ipos that were fully subscribed, your uber, your doorDash, your Airbnb, these are consumer companies that your friends use. You go get dinner or go have a drink and talk about these with the people around you. But where our edge is the companies, nobody wants to talk about. So if you bring them up, nobody wants to hear it. So I think that those really boring companies that are doing something within the supply chain differently is a very interesting area and an area that I think we can safely focus on for the next few years before software, at the consumer level at least, and enterprise level to some extent, really takes off."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yes. So basically the team is that the portfolio manager comes from technical analysis. And it's because we all know that tech is the world's most valuable industry. If you look at the top ten world's most valuable companies, half are going to be tech, even after a massive sell off. But the problem is that these, that it's so volatile that most people can't stomach the ups and downs. And we all had that reminder right in 2022. And that was actually, I'm sorry. Yeah, 2022. So, I mean, that was when we started to work with an automated hedge. So our losses were less so than other tech portfolios. And we will build key positions at the low and we will go ahead and trim and put money in the bank at the high and we release these real time trade alerts. But I can tell you that his background is Elliot Wave and he really believes very strongly that sentiment is what drives stock prices. I guess some people call it the fear and greed index, but his obviously is much more complex. Than that. And it's just, there's, you know, there's, there's waves of sentiment. And really, a great question is, where do we go now with, with a stock like Nvidia, it's up, you know, 200% this year. So it's like, where do you go with that? And the sentiment can get stretched, um, to where there's no more buyers. And so it's really important to take those gains because tech can sell off 30, 40% in the blink of an eye. And so our approach was, how do you safely participate in tech? That, to me, is the million dollar or billion dollar question that truly nobody has ever answered. Instead, what you get is you get the, this is going to change the world, bye bye bye. Or you get the only buy Apple and stay super safe and don't participate. And I think our goal as the I O fund has been to really find the middle ground, which is how can you participate safely? And we fully believe that technical analysis is very effective with tech because of that extreme sentiment. Precisely because it can fly up 100% to 200% and crash 40% to 50%. That means something is going on beneath the layer. Thats very sentiment driven. People are very hyped about it. Suddenly theyre in a trough of disillusionment, if you will, or something. And so that piece, technical analysis, actually is most effective in the really, across most industries. I think with tech, it's very effective."

I don't, you know, we could end up having to buy higher. We understand that that's a risk. But when there's these big moments in a, in a stock near term future, such as Google antitrust, I'm just giving you an example. We prefer just to go to the sidelines so that when we close, it's very, very rare that we would close and move entirely to the sidelines to wait something out. But companies like Nvidia and AMD and some of these other core AI positions, we trim at the top and buy again at the bottom. So we layer in. We're layering in all the time."

I really would, I guess, where if I were to talk to someone such as yourself, I think the one thing that I look for, I guess is very big addressable market. I want to see it take all market share if possible. So with the layer one, obviously we own Ethereum, but we've dabbled. But I would want to see more active users before because what does Ethereum have a couple million daily active users, or I think addresses. But then you look at a company like Snap or Pinterest and they have a couple hundred million. So I think it needs to reach scale before we go in too big. But I also agree with decentralization. I think that web three, this is going to be a very big deal down the line, if I were to guess. I think that it'll be the next innovation cycle and it may only be because it is so mind blowing. Blockchain, I think is just so hard for people to wrap their head around that it was going to take more than a couple of tries before it reaches scale. It's just basically disrupting everything that we do in every way possible. And I think that in order for people to really adopt a layer one at the scale, that they adopt a social media app, let's just say it's going to take that tipping point."

That's how disruptive it is because people think of it in terms of cryptocurrencies or nfts, and they don't really get the bigger picture. This is the rails that you need for the, for the digital world that we live. In my view on this is that 65 billion went into VC in the last cycle. A lot of that is the applications layer. I think we dont need to build yet another layer, one or even yet another layer too. What we need is applications, which I think is what youre saying. Fine, yes, you can have a position, but for you, you dont ramp up a position until you start to see that mass adoption at scale. If the financial industry starts adopting it properly for settlement of equities and stuff, okay, that's a very, very big deal. Or if brand side culture side starts taking off, we're already seeing car companies and luxury goods companies, fashion companies, using the technology to start with.

        "text": "And I think that it was really neat to be in Silicon Valley during the last startup boom because you can see that one thing about crypto that's unique is that more public investors or more global investors have this opportunity to participate in early stage tech that before was only reserved for VC's, venture capitalists. So it looks exactly like all the early stage tech I've been around. I was around all kinds of early stage tech. Uh, you know, it was a huge boom going on every night. There were four to five startup events to go to. And it looks like this, where there's a large failure rate, but one or two or three winners can make up for, you know, the ones that fail. And that's of course the VC playbook. But in general, what I'm saying is that the crypto market looks very early stage tech. I don't see anything different in that than, you know, it goes back to mobile gaming, cybersecurity. All of those looked very similar. It's just that they weren't on the public markets."

There's a lot of very bearish people out there. I'm very much on the bullish side, but I'm a longer term time horizon, so I don't mind a bit of volatility in the middle.

        "text": "I think that for a tech investor, that piece you always have to answer because of those blow off tops and the massive meltdowns. What we did is positioned even going into this year for a bull or a bear market. So what we did was just make sure our companies are defensible, they have strong free cash flow. Gap earnings, which you'd be surprised as to how many tech companies don't have. Gap earnings can basically weather recession, are going to be one of the last ones standing as cash becomes very tight if interest rates continue to raise. So, defensible on the bottom line, but innovative basically on the top line is basically how we belt the portfolio according to the portfolio manager's position, we will see a recession probably by Q one of next year, maybe Q two. It's not going to come. It's unlikely to come this month, but it'll come in the next six months. For us, that's good news because we would like to load up more on AI. Again, I think that AI is a five to ten year growth story. Again, we've been saying this since 2018, so we've been patiently waiting for what happened in 2023. This is not us jumping on a bandwagon. This is something that has carefully crafted, and we had thousands of members position for AI going into this year. And we've told them very clearly this next pullback. We already have ideas as to where we want to build our AI portfolio. So that 45% allocation, maybe 60 to 70 if we get that big pullback. So I guess what I'm saying is that if we get more of a continuation of this year, great, we'll participate. And if it looks a little bit more like 2022, which is totally a possibility, then we plan to increase our allocation."

If we do get that sell off, what we do, what we prefer to do, is hedge the entire portfolio. We will hedge up to 100% of the portfolio. So if we do get that sell off, the way that we protect our gains is we hedge quite aggressively, Trey."

        "text": "Fascinating conversation with Beth. We covered a lot of ground. Clearly, her core focus is AI with kind of Nvidia at the center of everything. When we came to try and get a clear answer about a boom or bust, I think she was somewhat more on the fence, which is like, I don't know, we expect a recession and we might expect prices to fall because of it. And so she's not fully risk taking. She's had a good run and is kind of in the watch and wait and see mode. So I think that for many of us sums up how some of us might deal with the current market conditions is participate, but maybe dont participate fully. And if you have to panic in later, you can do so. Another way I think Roger Hirst always talked about is if youve got a lot of positions and you are worried about change of market sentiment at some point. Whenever that comes, you can always just replace your stock and own calls instead. And then all you can lose is your call premium, particularly if you've made a lot of money in the tech rally so far. But overall, there is a lot of opportunities ahead. As ever, the commodity people at this point in the cycle are very bullish. On commodities, that's one thing. On tech, we know the long term picture that's been interesting. Crypto? Well, we're at the lower end still of the cycle range, unlike tech, which hasn't outperformed but relatively versus how it normally does. So tech's maybe run ahead of others because the narrative has been so big. There is lots of opportunity out there. I think the opportunity ahead is just remember, a recession is a temporary state of affairs. What lies on the other side is how the central banks and how the governments recover from it and what the economy looks like as it starts to grow again. And that's why I think, in my view, it all happened last year. But I could be wrong. But I think something like Beth, Beth's approach makes sense. Own the things you're comfortable with, and if there is a sell off, use that to your advantage. Anyway, good luck out there. I hope you enjoyed this last two weeks."
