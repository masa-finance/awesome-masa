These are statements from a conversation I had with global macro investor Raoul Pal and bitcoin billionaire Tim Draper. Tim is known for starting to buy bitcoin at just $4 and famously bought tens of thousands of BTC in 2014 from the US Marshals service. Raoul, previously a macro investor at Goldman Sachs, is the founder of Real Vision and the author of Adventures in Crypto. Collectively, Tim and Raoul have years of experience investing in cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies. So in this conversation, well discuss what showstopper concepts they've been investing in this year, how they've been diversifying their portfolios and where they think the markets are headed next. Oh, and we also had to take the opportunity to ask them their price predictions for bitcoin in 2024. This is a video that you don't want to miss and this sounds like the perfect accelerator storm for 2024 to be the next big adoption market cycle. Raoul, I'd love to get your outlook on next year and some expectations for the crypto market, but also the macro economy that will go alongside that."

        "text": "Sure, my view and my macro work was that the the present state economy is bottoming right now. All the future forward looking indicators all bottomed. Global liquidity, global financial conditions, they all bottomed last year and the markets priced in a recession then we've still got markets that are cyclical pricing in a recession now, stuff like the Russell 2000, oil markets, commodity stuff, but really all the forward looking stuff priced it in a while ago and it's been following financial conditions on a forward looking basis. From all of the work that I do, I see nothing but stimulus coming this year. To Tim's point, there's. Stimulus is another word for debasement of currency, and they do it in a number of different ways. The worst one, the most pernicious one, is the printing of money and putting it on the central bank balance sheet, using the balance sheet to buy debt. Because what you're really doing then is pure debasement of currency. And most people don't understand what it is. They don't understand the fact that their purchasing power in asset terms goes down. So assets optically go up in value because the purchasing power of the dollar versus scarce assets goes up. And crypto has been the best horse in that race. Technology has been particularly good at offsetting it. If you divide the s and P by the central bank balance sheet, zero performance since 2008. Gold, zero. In fact, gold is negative real estate zero. It's only Nasdaq, only technology and crypto that's actually outperformed the debasement of currency. So it's really important what holds you back. So we're going into 2024, we've got sluggish economic growth. I think inflation will continue to fall all year because I think structural issues within the economy, from aging populations to aihdem, will actually surprise people. To the downside with inflation. So I'm not an inflation sticky person. There's different types of inflation, right? We're talking asset inflation caused by debasement of currency versus CPI inflation. In an election year, the government's job is to give out as much candy as possible to voters. All they want to do is buy votes. You will always get stimulus. Since 2008, we had a great reset of the debt markets. Every major government hit 100% of GDP in debt by 2008. That's the Europeans, the Brits, the Americans, Japanese, Chinese. And what they all did was cut rates to zero in 2008. That was essentially a debt jubilee. It's like you don't pay the interest on the debt. That's really what it was. So if you don't pay the interest on the debt, what did they do? They all refined all of their debt, so it's 100% of GDP and debt. So all economic growth essentially goes to paying off the interest payments on the debt. So what you need to do is lower the interest costs of the debt. They did that and every government reset their debt to three to five year. That three to five year cycle is the debt refi cycle. It's exactly how the economy has been working. So you come into year, year four, it's the down year. That's when the economy slows because rates have gone up, because they have to try and refi. What happens is rates then fall. They use the balance sheet and they use the balance sheet to pay off the interest of the previous cycle. And I've kind of proven that out over time. That four year cycle is exactly the same as the bitcoin halving cycle. Why? Because bitcoin came in 2008. It's also the same as the presidential election cycle. Why stimulus? They're all the same thing. So it is the most observable economic environment of my 30 odd year career. And it's so obvious what 2024 and 2025 are, and that's more stimulus. They're going to be cutting rates. If they screw it up and inflation does go up, they will use yield curve control, which is printing of money to maintain interest rates, which Japan has been doing. But generally speaking, a year of stimulus, in a year of stimulus, as investors, we need to say, okay, what's going to create the biggest opportunity, set the multiplier on all of this is crypto. It always outperforms all other assets, particularly in these moments. And crypto, again, is such a beautiful thing. This won't last forever, but it's a gift for us because you get three years where it's the best performing asset on earth. That's through macro crypto, spring, summer, fall, crypto, macro winter. When the downside of the debt refi cycle comes, it's the worst performing asset price on earth. And we just keep repeating the lows are higher. It's just an exponential logarithmic trend that keeps going because of adoption. So the other thing to bear in mind about 2024 2025 is, okay, we've now built the ETF, which I think of as trade deal between cryptoland and fiat world. It's not immigration into cryptoland because these people are using centralized counterparts to do this, as opposed to myself, who will use my ledger device for self storage. But we're going to bring a lot of FDI, foreign direct investment and tourism income into crypto land, huge amounts of it, because of the stimulus and the fact that it's the best returning asset price on earth. So we've got that to also ignite this crypto economy. On top of that, Tim and many VC's like him have piled money in in 2020 and 2021, 67 billion went in. That money has been building applications, layers, infrastructure layers, all sorts of stuff. A lot of this will come to market. Some of it failed in the down cycle, but there's a lot of stuff coming to market. So how I look at this is this cycle as we go from 516 million wallets to I think a billion and beyond in this cycle alone, that it's going to be in everything, everywhere, all at once cycle. All of the kindling is in place. The banks, all the asset management firms are both investors but are also building on blockchain rails, all of them. So whatever Jamie says, and I've spoken to him directly about this, he's wildly interested in this space and they will, JP Morgan, Goldman, everybody are building on these rails. The big brands are building on the rails. For web three. We're seeing a lot of that already in sports teams, car companies, luxury brands. I think the breakthrough of Solana compressed nfts allowing for a million nfts to be printed for, minted for $100 means that allows ticketing and other breakthroughs of what we can use nfts for because nfts are not just pfps and stuff like that. In addition, the ongoing rise of stable coins, that's basically a tokenized eurodollar market that allows somebody working in the rice fields in the Philippines to own dollars, which is impossible for them. And then just the ongoing adoption of crypto. I know it sounds ludicrously bullish, but that's where we are in the cycle. I mean I've been in this in crypto since 2012 and each time you just see it grow and grow and grow as more participants come and more use cases get built out."

        "text": "Well, I'm really pretty excited about stacks. And the reason is, here's the way I looked at it. I watched the Internet boom and bust and boom again, and I, and I watched how the software industry grew even before that. And Microsoft created this platform, and then everybody created all this software on that platform. And that platform included then all these little companies created clip art and games and paint programs and all sorts of things. And then there was this one word perfect that started to really rock. And Microsoft looked over there, and then they created word, and then there was another one called Lotus 123 that was a spreadsheet, and it was booming. And Microsoft looked over there and created Excel, and then they saw PowerPoint rising, and they quickly bought it before it got too big. And they tried to get into it with money, and they realized they couldn't do that. They probably eventually will have to buy into it, too. But it's, what happened was there was a platform, and they let people do all sorts of things, and then they chose the things that really mattered. So I'm seeing sort of the same thing happen with bitcoin as a platform. Sure. A lot of the experimentation went on Ethereum and Solana and Tezos and whatever else, but now people are going, hmm, okay, so NFTs are a big deal, so we're going to create ordinals on bitcoin. Oh, okay, so Defi is a big deal. Okay, well, we're going to have Defi on bitcoin. Okay, smart contracts are a big deal. We're going to move smart contracts to bitcoin. I think that's happening. And I think there is a little bit, it's starting to happen in consolidation around bitcoin because as a platform, because I don't know if you noticed, but when bitcoin was at $40,000 the last time, Ethereum was at 3000, and now bitcoin is at $40,000 and Ethereum is at 2000 and all the way down. The rest of the tokens are also smaller relative. Most of them are smaller relative to bitcoin, the differential. So I think that there is this slow, steady movement toward all the important applications going on. Bitcoin. So I'm kind of looking most of what I've been investing in, although, I mean, we'll look at all sorts of things, have been things that start to move the important applications over to bitcoin. So I think that's a really interesting trend. And we're thinking it's going to go very much the way Microsoft did. If you're a retailer, you don't say, I accept tezos. You know, if you're, if you're buying, taking your first crypto wallet, you don't say, oh, I want to, you know, I want to own some cardano. So there is real, I think it's just one of those things where the strongest brand, and then people said, oh, well, bitcoin moves slowly on the blockchain, blah, blah, blah. But then all these great entrepreneurs that Raul was pointing out, all that technology has moved. So now there's the lightning network, there's stacks. There are lots of things that are making it so that it is not an energy hog and it is not slow. In fact, with an open node, I believe they can make transactions faster than the visa network. So I think that most of those old arguments are moving out in the new arguments of like, hey, let's standardize on bitcoin or moving in. But we're open. We're open to seeing whatever else is out there. We're looking for all these new solutions. I'm a big fan of smart contracts. I can't wait for the moment where I can raise all my investor money in bitcoin, invest it all in bitcoin, have them all pay their employees and suppliers in bitcoin, and their taxes and everything else, and have it all completely accounted for, audited, whatever, without an accountant, an auditor, a bookkeeper, a transfer agent, tax lawyer, or whatever this will be of this new economy will be, will have far less friction. And I think that that's very exciting. And it's going to free accountants and lawyers and auditors up to do doing more proactive work."

But personally, when I see extraordinarily high quality risk return opportunities in an identifiable macro trend where I can build a investment framework, I tend to super concentrate. So then for me, it's a very concentrated bet. So I'm pretty much 100% crypto and have been for a long time now. And I make asset allocations about weightings I don't really do, and I've tried it in the past to try and own a broader base of diversified base of tokens. I just end up with shrapnel in my wallet that I don't care about. I like to really focus on what I'm doing. So my big focus for this cycle is Solana, and that's been for the last year. Obviously, I have a lot of eth, I still have some bitcoin, and then I have a few other tokens here and there. But really it's a very concentrated bet on what I think is going to be the breakthrough for this cycle. And so, yeah, I'm not diversified at all. So I'm a terrible human being because I'm an investment guy and I should have this broad, diversified portfolio. I'm not at all.

And now they're suffering the results of that. But in my business, I invest in a very diversified portfolio of seed investments, very early investments, and some of those trees grow and some don't, and the winners become very big and the losers or the other ones, they sort of fade away in our minds. And so I end up with a very concentrated portfolio. So it starts out incredibly diversified. We invest in any technology, anywhere in the world where we think that there's a, a really interesting market that could happen. And so that our approach is a little bit different.

So 100 million might take them four years. A billion dollar valuation might take them seven years, and a $10 billion evaluation might take them 15 years.

The circle, I guess, Gemini twins, they might have something to go public at some point, but I think that they've got to shake through a few things before they do. And then, you know, what's interesting is there are some of these companies, like Ripio or the one in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, Coin Hako, that have gotten really big. And there is some question as to whether they go public or whatever, and then crypto, by its nature is liquid. It's just some of these are companies that are doing things for crypto.

Most countries have capital restrictions if they've got a weak currency and the rise of stable coins, it really shocked me because at first I just thought it was a liquid on ramp and off ramp into crypto. And I was speaking to some friends of mine in Singapore who run a big trading business there. QCP. And they were, they said, no, no, no. Most of the business we see in stablecoins is from corporates. I'm like, what? It's like, yeah. Indonesian corporates trading with chinese corporates because they don't have the settlement costs. They've both got capital restrictions. It takes a while to put the applications through. They just use this. I'm like, really? And then, you know, I get my hair cut and the guy here is Filipino and all the barbers are all mad crypto punters. I'm like, why are you guys, why are the Filipinos so into crypto?

What I didn't, when I predicted that, what I didn't expect was how fearful and just old thinking that the US would be. I thought we, because I think with a receptive us, we would be having conversations like the ones I have with the people from El Salvador. It's like, hey, have you done a smart contract for this? Or have you. Is the blockchain used? Is that thing blockchain secure or whatever? I think instead we say, oh, is that something that we can do? You know, we're sitting there doing that. And so I think all that is, is a delay. I'd call it the fear delay, the, you know, old government delay. And. And I would say that we. That my number of 250,000 will probably come pretty soon, so I'll stick with 250,000. We've already gone past my date deadline, so I'm wrong. I have never actually discussed this with my crystal ball. But if you've got four of them."

I mean, it'll be a range, though. I mean, I think though you will see 250,000. I actually think that if it hits 250,000, that it'll go way past it. But if it hits, you know, we are going through that cycle that Raul was talking about. I mean, we're going through the boom cycle. I think it."
