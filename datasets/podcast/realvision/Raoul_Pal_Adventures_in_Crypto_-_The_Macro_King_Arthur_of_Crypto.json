So let's start with the question that we all want to talk about, which what the fuck is going on? The macro is getting quite interesting. So give me your take. What's your view right now on the macro setup?"

        "text": "I mean, I guess it's this question of who's in charge, right? Is it the politicians or is it the bankers? Right? So I think in a lot of places, I was just reading an email from one of the hedge fund managers that manages some of my money in the small fund, and he was ticking down the different bass ackwards decisions. Like the Boe, right? So the government saying we want to spend more fiscally, and then the Boe is, okay, cool, we're going to stop doing quantitative tightening, but then we're going to hike rates on the other side. So it's almost like they've all read this textbook that started in the 1930s that said, okay, don't be Benjamin Strong, you have to prevent the depression. So that's what they did since 2008 and every other crisis, provide liquidity when they need to because they don't want to have that happen. And then they've got this, oh my God, we want to be like Paul Volcker if the inflation shows up. So we got to get on this inflation thing real quick. And so there's not a lot of nuance in between of like trying to dissect what's different about today versus the seventies versus the thirties. And that's the issue, right? You have a bunch of people who are saying, I've been trained my whole life to either provide money in asset deflation or hike in the face of inflation. And I don't want to be either. These two people that I read about as a student. And then on the other side you have politicians who need to get elected. And if the poor members of society who are witness to all these rich people get rich over the last 30 years by just buying financial assets now are like, holy fuck, I can't afford to go to the pub because the pub can't afford its electricity bill because we got on this green bullshit where we know fossil fuels are evil, so we're not going to invest in them. But now my energy bill's up eight x in the last year. Like, do something. And I can. And then these are places where I can vote and I can go out and say, you know what? Fuck this. I'm voting myself money. And so I think you have this, this clash here. I also may think the government always wins and you will always provide the bread and circus for the people if it means losing your job. And so while these central banks right now are playing this game that they're going to raise rates and fight inflation, at the end of the day, if the government needs wartime financing for payments to the people, the central bank is going to fall in line and do what they're told. And I think that'll play out over the next maybe months, quarters, years. But I think that's really the conundrum that we're at. And one thing that I think people don't realize is let's think about what happened in March 2020. We had this fear that the corporate bond market and the treasury market in the US was seizing up. You had stocks crashing and treasury yields going wild. Fed do and nationalize the corporate bond market in an afternoon. If the Fed was really serious about fighting inflation, they were calling extraordinary beings say, this is too much we can't have this. Short term rates are not 10%. Real rates are positive 2% overnight. They did it on the other side. Why don't they do it on this side? Because they actually don't care about inflating inflation. It's all window dressing politics. That's just my view."

And I think it was from like, I don't know, the 17th or 18th century up until today. And it basically showed I fossil fuel and energy usage. And you see this big, it's like basically flatline for the last 400 years. And then the last 100 years, you see the graph go like this when we discovered fossil fuels. And I don't know, is it. I think oil is 100 or 200 times more energy dense than wood, right? That is our modern existence. That's all we have. We are here today talking on this computer screen. You know, we get to do desk jockey. You know, our jobs are just pontificating on Twitter and video chat and not sitting on the farm because we have this thing called oil, natural gas, coal, and maybe a little bit of nuclear, that's it. If the central bank is going to tell me that we're about to either a commercialize nuclear energy to such an extent that there's going to be a little nuclear reactor in your car, powering energy at much cheaper rates than oil. And we're going to phase that all out and everything's going to be nuclear powered. Then show me the energy source that's 100 times more energy efficient than hydrocarbonization. And then I'll show you the way that we get out of this debt. Because at the end of the day, that's all that matters. We take the potential energy of the sun and the earth, we convert it into economic activity. And so if you're telling, unless you're telling me we're going to somehow recreate what's happened in the last hundred years with some sort of new magical discovery of energy efficiency, then there literally is nothing they can do unless the population goes through the roof to justify all this debt and all this build out of stuff."

Everyone's like, it's nuclear, obviously, and the politicians are like la la la, we can't hear you, really. And yes, humans will figure it out, but energy itself, I get concerned because everybody in the energy market is a supply sider and they never look at demand. And I'm looking at demand, it's like it's falling off a cliff. Guys, how's the oil price going to go up?"

That is the reason why we took this debt today, tomorrow there's all this other stuff we did cheaper than when it costs us for the debt that we took on because we borrowed from the future. So either it's, there's more humans that do more stuff, therefore we needed to build out more stuff today because of, you know, in 20 years we have all these adults, or we're going to be more energy efficient in the future. Therefore it's not going to cost us as much from an economic point of view, for all this debt. And that's the issue, right? We have all, we have highest debt load in 350 times GDP. Three to 50% of GDP is like global debt. Okay, show me the economic activity and the efficiency gains that justifies us pulling forward all that demand to build stuff today. And its either we have more people or more energy efficient."

Because that's, that's all, I mean, I know we all care about people and the fact that people don't have jobs and there's a lot of people starving and blah, blah, blah. But as financial market, you know, analysts, why do we care about these economics? Okay, what is it that biden or the politicians in Western Europe or Xi in China, what, what is it that's going to be so bad for them politically that they say, okay, you know, central bank, put the fucking money, I'm going to hand out the checks. What's the variable? I don't know what it is. We'll see. We'll know when we see it. Right. In March 2020, it was a corporate bond market. In 2008 it was mortgages in China. Now it's the property market. They said, oh, we're going to rein in speculation on property. It's basically collapsing their economy. Actually, no, hold on a second. Every central government, local governments start buying that property. We don't want it to go down actually. Right?

It was corporate bonds, it was repos, it was all these different things. So I think now it's a treasury market, right? As a bunch of different strategies have pointed out, dealers inventory has gone down, bid ask spreads have widened, volatility has gone up. And you have the Fed selling the treasury, selling the Chinese, selling the Japanese, selling the us commercial banks all selling bonds. Who the fuck's buying these bonds? At even the ten years of 3.7% today, inflation at eight. Okay, fine, on the nominal basis. It's nice to earn some more money on my fiat that's sitting in my brokerage account. But like, am I right? Buying these bonds? Yeah, I'm going to hold this thing for ten years and lose 4% real terms? No way. So who is stepping up and buying the trillions of dollars worth of bonds that need to happen in the Jews and Treasury market just to use the normal government functioning of today, and not to say that there's some military or other conflict that requires higher deficit spending or promises made by politicians in an election year. So I think the structural part of the intrusion we've identified and we know there's a problem. We know the problem is removal of liquidity. However, we haven't seen the effect yet. Once we see the effect, they'll all scramble. Okay, we're going to fix the treasury market and then it's game on."

        "text": "My little mental model is bitcoin is essentially us dollar liquidity plus technology. The technology piece is the technology underpinning a decentralized network that allows value to be transferred in a central zip resistant way. And we've a little bit longer than a decade of being able to do this very, very well. However, that's not a very sexy thing and it's very hard to evaluate, like who really needs one of these things. My bank account works fine. My credit card, my Amex works fine in most developed places. So, like, do I really need this like bitcoin thing? I'm talking like the mass adoption. Obviously, crypto people have a different view of this, so there's zero value to that technology. That technology is infinitely valuable. If you were a russian oligarch who suddenly found out that their dollars are no longer theirs anymore, then like, oh, shit, now I get this bitcoin thing. I didn't actually own any of those assets. I was just borrowing them from the bank or the government, and they let me use them at their discretion. And obviously, because of my passport, now I'm no longer welcome. And so therefore, all these assets no longer. But bitcoin doesn't work that way. So that's the technology piece, and it's sort of a, it's a binary outcome. Either you get it or you don't. And if you don't, you don't see why anyone would pay anything for that. And so you describe that as zero value, and that's the majority of people. So then you're just left with liquidity conditions, because bitcoin is a reaction against the profligacy of central banks and the dollar based system that we're in. And so we're just going to junk and jive with the dollar and how it trades and how much dollars there are, how cheap they are, and they're removed like they are today, that bitcoin gets smoked. But then slowly and slowly, as we sort of balkanize the world into this, like us, NATO versus Russia, China, Eurasia type situation, more and more people find out that what they thought they owned, they don't. And therefore they understand why people in bitcoin are. So they marvel at this technological feat that's been created, and therefore, okay, that technology is kind of worth something. I kind of wish I had some bitcoin. Even if I bought it at 69,000 and it's worth 18 now. That's better than having a $10 million house that's now fucking zero. Take your pick."

A bank bail in? No, it was theft of savers money. And it was that moment I thought, holy shit, nobody owns anything. And that's what got me into bitcoin. 2013 was that very thing. And the russian situation is exactly that. But it happened at central bank reserve level as well. It's like, oh, those aren't your dollars anymore. It's an extraordinary change.

And I think the DeFi moment is basically allowing the world to own the financial services that they use in a longer tail future. You can't really own the bank that you use in any meaningful way. You can't really own the exchange that you're trading. A lot of the things that you're trading on, you can't really own Sotheby's and Christie's where you trade, you know, the highbrow art, or you can't really own YouTube, like, so you. All these different services that we use are all very tightly owned for financial asset holders, which is what the top, richest, ten to 1% of the world versus now we have this ecosystem where anyone can create a service and confer ownership by using it. And these tokens have value because they allow you to govern how these things work. Obviously we're very early stages of that and there's a lot of things to work through, but I think Ethereum powers that and that's why it's so powerful is the services that it's going to enable for the mass of the world to own the services that they currently use today. But they have no say in them. They can't own them. And so I think that's the promise."

If we were all Facebook shareholders, we'd have done really well. Yeah. Okay, so that's Ethereum. So then I'm going to come back to Ethereum about yield in a minute. So then what's your mental model about the rest of the space? Ethereum is more decentralized, slower, more expensive. How does the rest of the space fill in the gaps?

So then the other ones go, yeah, we're faster, we can do it better, give us some money too. That's how that happened. And a lot of them did very well in the last cycle. Most of them don't really have that much actual usage as we're finding out today. And so they all crash, just like Ethereum crash in its first iteration. And so the question now is, okay, well, you guys have this advertised very, very fast transaction speed. Great, show me the applications that are used by at least some people doing stuff. That's the question right now is like you have to have users that are willing to spend real money and not just receive inflated tokens. And so I think that's the question that all the yddeh investors and me as well are just looking at new projects like, okay, well, show me the user, show me somebody willing to pay real money to use your service. And I think that's where we're at right now. Whether or not any of these other l ones are going to be able to gain market share, I think it's going to be very tough unless they get a lot of developers, because Ethereum by and large has greater than 90% of all. So you want to call it defi dapp developers. How do I break through as an l one to get the random developers? Okay, I need to get into web three. So then they have to choose, okay, which what am I going to learn because I only have so many hours in a day? Do I learn solidity? Do I learn rust? Do I learn ocaml? Do I learn what fucking language do I learn? Right? And so if you're not able to sell yourself to that developer, then they're going to go, okay, I know the ethereum, they have the most people, they have the most usage. Okay, I'll go develop over there. It doesn't even matter if it's faster or slower or whatever, but as a developer, I want to develop for my thing to be used as I want to go to the place where I think there's the most users. And that's the challenge for any of these l one. Not to say that they can't do very, very well on a price perspective going up off of a bottom, I think.

What are you looking at? That's going to give you an idea of, okay, look, this is worth the punt versus.

So let's talk a little bit about yield, because you were one of the people to write a lot about this, and I've written a lot about this, is I still think the market is underestimating what having a benchmark yield rate is from Ethereum, because we've kind of established, it's like, okay, this is the value protocol for the Internet right now, so there's no real challenger for that. Bitcoin has no yield. It's not what ethereum is. So here's a benchmark. Great. You and I know everything in the world, in the real world, in the physical world, is priced treasuries or Libor plus. I'm thinking this is a huge breakthrough because we can price everything as ethereum plus or ethereum minus, so we can understand risk better. Because we just learned three months ago that nobody understands fucking risk yet again. Right? So that's how I'm thinking. How are you thinking this yield plays out? Because I think this leads to another explosion in defi, meaning positive explosion, because we've now got something to get our teeth into, which is a yield that makes sense."

        "text": "Raoul. So I think there's a. So on the one hand, I think it solves the question. Oh, crypto doesn't yield anything. It does. Here's a yield. Now the other detraction as well, at 4% or 5%. It's basically just at treasuries. So you're not really going to, if the interest rates are high in the tradfi world, you're not really going to see the hedge fund manager be like, okay, trades are at zero, Ethereum at 4%. So maybe I should structure some trade again to eth. I don't think that's the play anymore. Maybe that was a thinking six, seven months ago, back before this happened. Fine. But what I really think that the ETH yield does is it acts as a quality control mechanism. If you're going to come in as a project and say, I'm going to build this amazing future, I have a discount right now. Before it was zero, you could tell me all sorts of bullshit, and it doesn't matter because you're just a long duration asset. Yield zero. Cool, whatever. If not negative, right? Because ether, the supply keeps going up. But now you're telling me, okay, I'm going to build an ERC 20 asset, and my discount rate is 4%. Okay? And I'm going to get a lot different. My response to your valuation, the ability for you to generate users, really changes. Is a user really going to take the risk of getting rug pulled on staking your coin when they could literally just buy Ethan, earn 4%, 5% in the staking derivative? So I think, yes, it's going to lead to good things, but it's also going to mean a lot of shitty projects are not going to be able to raise the kind of money that they used to be able to raise, because now there's something to compare it against, like a real thing like income, that if you're already going to do ERC 20 stuff, well, I better yield at least 4% a year, right. I think that that's going to be, that's going to be good for investors, right. It's going to be good to filter out things that were obviously never going to work, but you had to play around with it first to figure that out versus, okay, I can get this thing in a more attractive valuation because these guys know that theres a hurdle right now, theres some competition."

Because if youre going to hold the brazilian real, its a volatile currency and you want a high yield for that. If you want to hold the US dollar, you can accept a lower yield or the euro for that matter. And I think we need to get to that as well, where we can start volume adjusting, checking the yield and saying there's excess return here or there isn't."

And they're like, we've got pension liabilities to fund and this doesn't help us because if it doesn't go up for five years, we don't get anything. So right now, they were all looking at bitcoin. That was the root of entry. Now if you're a big pension plan ethereum, you can do that. Sure, you dont get excess returns right now versus treasuries, but at least youve got a yield. So you get the access to the technology, as you said, but with a yield. If your mental model of bitcoin was technology plus liquidity, youve got technology plus liquidity and yield compensation, which is interesting."

That was the yield that we had. That was our iteration of fixed income in crypto. But now we get to have a real on chain native to the protocol fixed income. And I'm just really excited for the types of products that people are going to come up with to take that yield and move it around and take the risks and share them around the ecosystem. It's going to be really interesting to see the different types of protocols that are now going to be enabled and be popularized because we have this staking yield of yield."

Tide went out, everybody went bankrupt, and you had forced selling. And I monitor some of the Aave compound makerdao, like all the DeFi protocols that have forced liquidations. And you're seeing most of that curve was in the 1000 to 2000 bucket. And after mid June of this year, it's shifted down to the seven $6500 bucket. So I'm like, okay, well, I don't. And then you think about, okay, who's gone bankrupt, the largest, most well revered hedge funds, startups, you know, personalities have all come up and had some sort of financial difficulties. So the only people left who I think could sell in size are the miners. And then you have to wonder, okay, well, when they have had to sell in size in mid June, when the price is even lower than they are today, when people were pulling credit, nobody could get credit. Now things have kind of stabilized a bit, you know, who's fucked and who's not. So my view is that I'm trying to think of like a cohort that didn't have to sell a month and a half ago, two months ago, who now needs to sell today, because we're back at the same level. And I just don't see that sort of intensity, which leads me to believe that we're just chopping around, chopping around the bottom. We might not be here for a while, we might be here for a while. That doesn't mean that we're going up anytime soon. But I just don't know who else has democracy sword over their head, who has to sell today?"

After the merge, that's what they're going to do. Yeah, I dont see it either. I dont see the sellers, but I speak to a lot of institutional investors, and everybodys doing the work, everybody wants to be involved, but you know what people are like, they can never ever buy Lowe's, they cant do it. They have to buy FOMo, they just cant do it."

And I used to be somebody who sold them financial products as a sell side baker, I get it, right. We all went to the same 25, 50 schools, we all wear the same costume to work every day, and you make a few hundred grand, and you basically know how to do basic excel, and you have a great job, and you very quickly realize that nobody else in no other business in the world would pay you that kind of money to do the little amount of intellectual work that you do. And so you're like, why do I, what am I going to do? I need to keep this job. This is a great job. You know, I get social standing. I can go out to nice restaurants, blah, blah, blah, get to travel and go on vacation, and I sit in the chair all day. Right. And so do you really want to risk your job buying crypto for what is it you're going to, is your aum all of a sudden going to, like, quadruple this year to get you a big bonus because you bought the bottom in bitcoin? But what if you didn't and bitcoin went from 17,500 to 10,000, you lose your job. And so, like, this makes zero sense for them to buy crypto because the one or 2% of their allocation that they may be allowed to buy crypto, if they go and they go long and they lose so much money, whereas everybody else just stayed out of the market, you lose your job and then you got to find real work that requires much higher level of training and intellect than being an asset manager. I think that is the reason why institutional investors will never, ever buy the bottom in crypto. They can buy the bottoms in stocks and whatnot because the whole system owns stocks. The tribe system doesn't own crypto. It's not their thing. They're coming into it as a newbie, so it's risky for them."

Which makes me think that when it does change, when we get the macro turn, it goes up pretty sharply because of this, this very issue of a lot of people who've done the work, they've got their custody agreements they've set up with fire blocks and Anchorage or with Coinbase, whatever, they're ready to go and they pull the trigger. Eventually there will be the bozos who buy the high, whatever that high is, because that is markets, right? I bought the ETH calls high. That's fine. I can live with that. That was that bozo.

And, you know, the tribalism, the intense pathos on the various social media platforms from the different tribes fighting each other. That's very religious. It's humanity. And that's what we're missing from. From financial markets in general, right? Like, I used to work on a training floor at a trade stock. It got really, really boring, like quite quickly after the crisis because all the fund was taking away, right? It wasn't 1980s or 1970s like you read all these finance books about all the masters of the universe today, like discovering these new ways to price an option and creating these new derivatives to bring more liquidity to the mortgage backed securities markets. All the people in charge of all the banks today, that was their crypto moment, where they got to create something new, where they got to debate, what is this worth? How do I create a formula or a mental model for this new financial product and this new way of doing business? Trad five today is, let me tick this box. Tick that box. Here's a vwap over the day order. And that's your job. And so I think that's intensely boring. And that's why I think crypto is so amazing, because we're creating something new. People have different ideas and they. Some work, some don't. There's all this emotion, there's got this religious aspect of, like, what is money? And like, we're literally creating the money for humanity and the whole world and how do we get as many people involved as quickly as possible? And so I think that's what makes this interesting and continues to be. And the people that I meet are extremely intelligent and they all have this vision of what they want to create.

Why do you work your everybody consumes culture, whether that's a nice restaurant, it's your favorite musician, it's a sporting event, it's art on the wall, it's your favorite glass of wine. These are all artistic pursuits and we've created this whole society and we work really hard. And all the access goes to arts in various shapes or forms. Here's this technology that's going to allow us to trade that on a market and pass ownership between each other in a scarce way, you know, digitally, in a fidelity, in a way that has fidelity digitally across the world, anyone can trade it. That is a massive opportunity. And I think it's great now that the traditional financial media just think it's a bunch of dumb kids trading at jpegs. Fine.

Yeah, I mean, I think also, I look at this and I think culture has become an asset class. It was an asset class if you were Bernard Arnault, because you could build Louis Vuitton. Right. But for the rest of us, it wasn't very easy. But now we can participate in culture as an asset class. And I think it was McKinsey who said, there's $60 trillion of intangibles on global balance sheets, and that's brand culture, those kinds of things. And I think it's all going to get tokenized. Now, how much of that? But a big amount of that gets tokenized because it shares it with the community and the powerful behavioral economics behind it all. I even set up a whole business based around this whole idea, which is that culture becomes an asset class. And I could see it everywhere. Everybody I talk to, every fashion brand, every music artist, every physical artist, anybody, they're all laser focused. Every movie studio. What is the value of Disney? It's a $250 billion company. But the value of the culture of Disney and the brand, probably a trillion, 2 trillion, who knows? Probably the single most valuable brand on earth. But the market doesn't price it that way.
