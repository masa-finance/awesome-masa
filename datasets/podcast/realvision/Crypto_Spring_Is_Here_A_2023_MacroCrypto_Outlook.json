    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. So a big theme for us really last year and I think it's going to be extremely important this year especially as well is it really all boils down to liquidity and global liquidity cycles. And once you start to have that framework, a lot of what has happened and taken place and the outlook becomes I think, a bit more clear. The timeline is still again a moving target. But the big thing were focusing on is tracking liquidity and where we think we are in that liquidity cycle. And what we saw at the end of last year as we were putting out that markets year ahead piece was you started to see the early signs that liquidity cycle very well may have bottomed and was starting to show early signs of a reversal. Now whats important is that when that has happened historically, usually you dont see the full effects of that really impact the markets and financial markets for at least six to twelve months, sometimes as long as 18 months. So there is a lag to this. That was our framework around contraction. Liquidity was a huge theme. One of the core drivers, as everyone woke up to why macro was so important last year. Those are the core drivers of the drawdowns in 2022. If we're starting to see that cycle start to turn, my base case right now is I think 2023 is going to be a year of accumulation. That's going to be a choppy, volatile market. I think we're going to have a couple of different phases to the year in terms of market price action. In the short term its a bit less clear. But in the longer term, second half of 2023 and really moving into next year, I think the outlook becomes a lot more bullish. Thats our base case here and im happy to get into how were thinking about the phases of this year. One thing youve seen so far, just in January, the last several weeks, is this increase in dollar liquidity, which again, has coincided with a pretty strong rally within risk assets, crypto equities, etcetera. I do think, though, that there is this potential for and a decent probability that the market gets a little ahead of itself, as we tend to do sometimes. There's a repricing that goes on, because right now it seems like everyone's trying to almost front run the front run. So I saw a great tweet from somebody who was, I think, institutional sales, equity sales, and he was talking to a bunch of his clients over in Europe and he said, it's amazing to me that everyone's base case now it's become more consensus that recession risk is top of mind, right. We move from inflation risk to recession risk. And that's something everyone's pretty much screaming about at this point sometime later in 2023. But at the same time, everyone's buying risk. Right. And the anticipation of looking past the actual, let's say, immediate effects of what a recession will do to what the expected policy response is going to be. And so the risk of the repricing comes in wherever, if Jay comes out, Powell comes out in the next couple of meetings and is keeping to the higher for longer. And the timeline around that expected policy response gets pushed out further than most people expect right now because a lot of people are expecting it to be sooner. That's where I could see some more volatility coming to the market and potentially, again, a cool off phase consolidation before setting up for more bullish second half of the year and really getting into next year."

    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. So I've got, obviously using a similar framework with liquidity, and my forward looking stuff there suggests that it's fully turned. So everything from the China credit stuff to the global macro investor financial conditions index turned really sharp. So I'm expecting a bottom in the cycle in April. That's the teeth of the recession. I think we're just going to go off a cliff now. But I think the market has priced this. It knows the recess, everybody knows there's a recession. There's literally not a person in the world doesn't know that right now. The question is, okay, if liquidity does change, how does this play out? And I looked at previous times and it depends. ETH is very closely following bitcoin 2013. If that's the case now, then we could get a bigger spike and then a correction. If we're tracking the 2018, it's similar. I mean, it went 283% and then spent six months coming down. Now, if I look back and remember what was happening in so 2018 when it all took off, was the pal pivot. He's like, okay, we stopped raising rates. People confuse it and say, thinking they cut rates. They didn't cut rates until September, August, and then they stopped QT in September. But up until about June, crypto rallied like crazy, and then it then corrected as the Fed started delivering on rate cuts. So it's kind of buy the rumour, sell the fact bit and then started getting traction later. So somewhere in that is this two halves idea I kind of agree with."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So I'm looking at that period as well. And I think, again, if you even look back at the drawdown, right, the peak and then drawdown, the 2018 cycle, a lot of similarities to what we've seen in the most recent kind of drawdown cycle. If we're putting ourselves in that position saying, okay, this is kind of end of Q 120, 19 April 2019, right, where you saw that big kind of wick right at the end of the quarter. And then, to your point, the market continued to rip higher in the second quarter of 2019. On the back of, again, a somewhat similar backdrop in terms of changing macro expectations, specifically around Fed policy. What we saw there was this echo bubble of sorts where you had people really, again, getting bullish risk coming back into this market. We saw 200 plus percent price appreciations in a relatively quick period. But then you hit this point where buyer exhaustion caught up to the market and you saw a top out in the consolidation you referred to because it's not enough for the Fed to come. And even if they pause rates, I think that's what everyone's looking at as, okay, that's the pivot. But that's not the most important part of this. It's what comes next and the timing of that liquidity."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. And so what was different about the 2013 example is it did a sideways range. It put this big flag pattern and then broke out again, while 20 and 19 was that quite big correction, taking back quite a lot of the move. And then crypto ended up the year up 100%. I don't know which way it plays out, but what's going on in my head is, okay, fine, we've got these two examples. That's not a lot to go by, but we've got a rough idea what we think it could do. But then I think about the market itself right now, and everybody is underweight 18% of the entire market's in stables. Every hedge fund is gun shy. Retail are a bit like this, and we know the institutions did all of the work on allocation, stuff like that. And it feels that everybody short the upside, because the more it goes up, the more that they think, fuck, I need to pull the trigger now, maybe that gets the excess optimism, or maybe it is so bullish, because again, if I think about the eth burn, if we burning stuff in a small rally from the low, imagine when participants actually really come back, we're going to end up with a lot of people wanting to buy ETH, and less and less eth every day coming onto the market. I just think it might be different this time. What that means, I don't know."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, it's a really interesting one. And coming into this year, I even said that I think, not to say it has the highest upside return potential, but I think from a risk adjusted basis, ETH probably was one of the best bets you could be making, if your time horizon is longer than, let's call it six to twelve months, for a lot of the reasons you just mentioned there. It's a really interesting dynamic when we start to see that demand for ETH coming in less ETH, because there's more ETH being burned. And you almost have this very vicious potential cycle, in a sense, right? Because the more it gets used, the more demand there is, the more transactions and the higher gas prices go, it."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "No, nobody's going to say. And I think that's also what a lot of people are going to start to, if they haven't already wake up to in terms of what again, that short term, potential bearish narrative looks like right now. Because one, to your point, no, I wouldn't. And two, I think the fact that you now will have much more control and much more certainty over the ability to unstake. Right. That reduces the risk of even some liquidity staking derivatives. Right. You yourself personally might not use those, but I, if you look at some of those LSD's like Lido, like you mentioned, I think that becomes possibly even more popular. Right. Because it is a relatively easy way to get that type of exposure and maintain the liquidity of your stake itself and the uncertainty, because you're reducing that uncertainty, it by nature reduces the risk around or the risk that people are factoring into staking eth. Right. So I agree with you. I actually think that that's going to be, again, short term, you never know. But I think that's going to actually be more of a bullish catalyst than a bearish catalyst."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. So there is one world, and again, neither of us know anything here. We're just trying to figure out the probabilities. There is a probability that is not small, that eth actually gets unruly to the upside in a way that people don't expect. Because we are all expecting some sort of consolidation. We're all expecting. But if you get that moment in time where retail is piling in, there's activity going on as DeFi comes back in new forms, nfts get going and we've got reduced supply because of the staking and we've got the burn. I mean, we could set ourselves up to something, this tremendous crypto bubble. There's a possibility of that, I think."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah. If you look at really the last cycle, right. We talked about liquidity earlier, a big part of that was also fueled by liquidity conditions within the crypto market itself, not exogenous ones. We're talking about global liquidity. But when you look at, say, eats, price is going up and you're using that as collateral and some of these DeFi lending protocols to go get exposure elsewhere or to add onto more of your position as the value of that collateral is going up, these price going up, you're basically increasing the borrowing capacity of the entire system. That's what can cause these really blow off tops and these excessive bubbles that it feeds on itself. What we saw last year was really the unwind of that and the dark side of leverage. That type of leverage. Yeah, 100%."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. Look, it's not a straightforward year because I can see lots of different outcomes. Let's talk about some of the other tokens protocols at a broad level. What's interesting to you, mine, it's not the most liked by some people and other people love it, is Solana. The reason my simple thesis on Solana, you know, I'm very simple in these things, is like they clearly wanted to go and adapt, adopt the hundred, you know, the next hundred million, 500 million, a billion people, because they're consumer facing. They've got fucking stores, they've got a phone, you know, they've, they kind of get that side of things. And I just look at the chart and it's so similar to ETH in 20 1819 with the exact same drawdown. The price pattern's the same, everyone's given it up for dust. Ok. That's interesting to me. Any view on Solana?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, no, I think that's, and I think about these in very simple terms too, because our team are the ones who are very much in the weeds on all the technical aspects of all this. And I think for me, where I've spent a lot of time, and I'm sure we'll get into this, is around what you mentioned there in terms of going after the quote unquote normie crowd or more kind of mainstream adoption. And you can definitely put Solana in that category. I think even, and this is probably a very contrarian one, and there's good reasons for that. But I think a lot of the developments, especially on the partnerships that flow has been able to get recently, is certainly quite interesting. This focus, I think a big focus of this year and next year are going to be around consumer facing products and products that are going to drive real, actual usage and serve a real purpose. The way in which I've thought about this is if you think about taking a step back and looking at the way in which crypto has evolved and these different kinds of hype cycles, I think we've gotten to a point where we have enough of the pieces in place now to be able to create some really creative use cases around this technology and these assets to incentivize different things and to bring more people in. Right. Bitcoin was what kicked us off. We know that. But even with the launch of Ethereum, that really having a standardized or a token standard for fungible tokens is what really helped to fuel the 2017 ICO boom. Then you fast forward and you've got Defi and whole Defi summer. Because now you had products like Uniswap that were launching and you had the advent of liquidity mining. And so that was another kind of speculative bubble. What was an innovation trigger in itself. Then you fast forward, you had the whole more consumer facing NFT side of things that we just came out of last couple of years. While each of those was a hype cycle in and of itself and led to big booms and big busts, each of them left behind important pieces of the puzzle that we can now start to fit together, I think in really unique ways where you can have hybrid NFT and fungible token models, eventually you have enough pieces to start to build out. Whatever your solution is for you. Whether you're a web three native protocol, whether you're a web three native community, whether you're a large brand organization trying to leverage web three into an existing business model, there's enough pieces for you to now play with to be able to build your own custom solution coming back to your original point. That's why I think some of those chains that are going and focusing on making the user experience a lot more intuitive, abstracting away some of the things that they can abstract away and also going out and targeting more of those consumer facing types of applications and potentially products are ones that I certainly am excited about. I would put slot on that camp flow again, I don't have a strong thesis on it yet, starting to build that out, but I'm watching what they're doing in that space. And not to pick a winner, I think you put that in a basket with something like, again, eth polygons doing polygon."

But if anybody's going to crack scale, it's that the other one that's really interesting to me is sui Mister Labs. Because that is hugely fast and an amazing team and that kind of stuff. So that comes out and that feels like it might be the Solana of this cycle. Who knows? We've got instead, or arbitrum or whatever. There's a few of these to come, really big ones."

If youre not talking about 100 x or 200 x, but youre talking about seven x, eight x, ten x, theres a lot of really interesting NFT collections that have done well. Again, I think if youre coming in as an individual investor or even a smaller fund, you can get exposure to that space.

But how, I thought about it as well, I think we talked about this in the past, is that if you invest in an ETH NFT, lets say you get the ETH exposure. So if ETH goes from wherever we are today, 1700 and it goes to 3400, your NfT might move around a little bit versus ETH. But generally speaking, you get that ETH appreciation. Now, if you get it right one of the reasons that I bought a punk recently was the fact that, okay, they're about as cheap as they've been and they're stable at 65 eth right now. They're like high end property. So as the market goes up, they tend to outperform because people want to show off and they want to invest their ETH and they want to buy these things. So they tend to be a call option on the bull market. I still get the eth exposure, but if I'm right and punk's triple, which would go back to the high, then I get the eth exposure tripled. People don't understand this, which is why some of those grails, some of those art ones, are potentially really good investments. Because what's the downside of a punk and ETH terms? 30%. What's the upside? 300%. That's a ten for one on an asset that's already going up. Potentially ten for one as well. That's really interesting to me.

It's almost somewhat similar to, in a sense we're talking about with like liquid staking derivatives, right, where if you don't have enough eth to, let's say, run a validator yourself, you can deposit it in one of these LSD platforms to be able to say, I want to stake one eth, I want to stake two ETH, whatever it is, and it gives you that accessibility if you don't have the means to be able to do it. There's, I think, still some questions around when you fractionalize, let's say an ape or even a punk apes is probably more applicable here. Just given the other utility or ways in which you can use it. There are still questions, I think, around at the end of the day, who owns that? Or if it comes to some type of voting for an NFT, a high priced NFT, and you have 1000 people that own fractional shares of it. Is there a way in which you basically just aggregate what the, almost like proxy billing, you aggregate what the general sentiment is of all the owners and then that gets pushed forward as the single vote. From an ownership perspective, there are still questions, I think, around that, but in terms of exposure, yeah, there's platforms that are now fractionalizing nfts and even starting to allow you to borrow and lend against your NFT holdings."

You heard it from the CEO of Microsoft saying it will have its AI moment at some point. What is it going to be? Come on to Defi in a sec. But the financial system is slow to adopt it. They're testing it, but at scale. To get the Nasdaq to adopt it for security and stuff like that takes a long time. So it feels that retail brands, and that part is where the next really big phase is. I think you agree with that as well. That's probably where. Because for this whole space to grow, we have to go from 300 million users to a billion users this time around or more. And that's going to come from something else that is at scale. And we've seen, you and I have been involved with this stuff like Ticketmaster that I've talked about a lot, and we're seeing people use this. We've just seen California talk about putting car registration documents on tezos. Okay, that's kind of interesting as well. Two things.

Now, again, it's not as if there's a hard cap on eth, right? There are fluid dynamics there. One of the things I've over time, kind of grown to realize is, while again, bitcoin is absolutely instrumental in everything we're talking about today. Right. Wouldn't be here without it having a digitally scarce, hard capped asset. In order for that to become this true kind of peer to peer, decentralized type of money network over time, or even be used as a reserve currency that I think people are still kind of holding onto, there has to be some type of, at least in my opinion, flexibility around supply, because if not, this asset will always be exposed to excess volatility that will make it very difficult to eventually be some type of more stable, true store of value that people would want to engage or interact with. We've joked about the Starbucks example for years now in terms of I wouldn't pay for cappuccino with bitcoin, but I think, again, it has its purpose, I think potentially as a store of value long term from an investment side. But the peer to peer digital cash narrative that it was one of the reasons it was originally founded or founded upon, to me, it has lost some of its luster."

You need the number of people using the network and the connections, and there's no connections on bitcoin. Yes, we got the lightning layer that batches transactions, but there's nothing else being built on it in the same way. So by definition, it can't do as well. The other thing is that if you're an asset allocator, and given the choice of ETH versus bitcoin and the green narrative stuff, you're always going to take ETH because it yields. You get a 5% real yield after supply and you've got the access. You're betting on the technology being adopted. Why would you not? So, yeah, I just feel like bitcoin's floundering and it's actually getting narrower in its focus. And somebody was joking. I can't remember who it was, was joking. You now need to be only eat meat, only take cold showers in the morning. You have to be this austere. You only read Seneca every day to fixate, or Marcos Aurelius to fixate on how terrible life should be. You should be wearing a hair shirt. You never spend any money, you just stack sats.

Again, that gets into more of the, let's say, technical aspects. That maybe isn't a problem, certainly not in the next twelve months, maybe not five or ten years. It is something that people have started to even question within this last cycle around. If you look at just the amount of fees that bitcoin brings in versus something like eth, right, putting the proof of stake change to the side, it's just not nearly as exciting. And I just don't think it's as useful. There's not enough there that's being built on top of it, or eventually we built on top of it."

The beauty is in bitcoin simplicity, and that's what it should always stay as, and you have others in their side saying, well, if this actually potentially increases the demand for black space within bitcoin and then that could increase the amount of fees it brings in. People are trying to start to see if that helps to maybe have it catch up with something like ETH because the fees eventually will become really important.

He'll end up probably buying or getting an NFT which is attached to ETH without even knowing that he's got eth exposure. It's going to be very interesting. The other thing that I think we've skirted around is you said something very interesting that I think is dead right is you usually get an innovation bubble, then you get all the failures and stuff doesn't work. But out of that comes the learning and the next phase. And I feel that Defi, given what happened to the centralized exchanges and listening to Joey Krug at Pantera, who's like, this is the big theme for us. I think it makes sense. I don't even know where or what. Sure, you can own uniswap and aave or whatever, DXDy is another one that people are looking at. But it feels that there's a lot of innovation to come out of Defi because people have been building, resolving issues, figuring out what goes wrong, what goes right. Thoughts?"

I know thats a bit of a loaded term within this space, but the uniswaps, the aaves of the world, that held up extremely well when they were tested and we almost take for granted at this point how well they do work. I think on one side, again, having exposure there, I certainly think theyll benefit, especially if we get to a point where institutions, we'll call it more professional investors are coming into this space. They're leveraging or relying on valuation frameworks to justify or figure out where they're allocating. On an individual asset level, uniswap itself. DydX is actually another, I think, great example of one that potentially has even more potential. Those are actually generating real fees. There's real actual network activity happening on those applications. So that I think they certainly have going for them. Decentralized options is something that our team has been focused on for probably the last twelve to 18 months. It's still very early stages, but it's necessary infrastructure, especially when you have more of those investor types coming in and they want to be able to efficiently hedge positions and run different strategies. What I do think is important though, and this ties a couple themes we've been talking about together, is we don't get to the next 100 million new entrants within web three by just trading DeFi tokens on other DeFi protocols. That's where I think, again, you have this merging of themes around nfts seem like they're out here on their own island. But if you're able to now fractionalize those, let's say you have a fungible token component to that, or there's hybrid models that arise where you've got nfts that serve as more membership loyalty, even being used as personal identifiers, and then you've got layered fungible tokens on top to tokenize communities. Point being, the more of that we have, the more we increase, I think the surface area for new entrants to come in. In which case you're now trading and defi benefits from this immensely. You now have more assets or more different diverse types of assets to trade across these different DeFi protocols. And its similar if you want to draw the parallel to just traditional markets. Its not as if we only have access to financial and banking stocks within the S and P. You have a whole litany of different sectors and industries."

Because yes, the modern system, in traditional finance, the finance system actually became larger than the economy, and it still is to the day. But that's an interesting dynamic to look at, because I think, as you say right now, particularly with the experience and Defi, and how difficult some of these things are still, that you can tell whether it's overshot because it shouldn't grow massively as a percent. The space needs to grow first and then the opportunity to use DeFi. Once you've created stuff so you can see it with ETH and ETH staking, which is why Lido and other stuff has done well, that became something that there was enough people holding ETH and therefore there was demand for this.

It kind of feels like that game has played out because of layer twos and other abilities to change stuff. So is this the last of the layer one cycle?

This is something our team ops tracks pretty closely and is built out of thesis around. We go back to Cosmos. I think the rise of app chains is really interesting because they're nothing necessarily their own separate l one s for layer ones, but they do allow you to create your own custom chain in a sense, or build your applications on top of customized base layer infrastructure. That, again we saw with DydX, where they're planning to move over and use the Cosmos SDK for the next version of DydX because of some of the inherent limitations with other solutions. A world in which to try and more directly answer your question, that could be a bull case for the cosmos ecosystem going forward. But it's not as if it's the last wave of l one, it's just more fragmented app chains that are built for more custom use cases that are tied together within, let's say, one l one ecosystem."

That again, I think that's a pretty big improvement, a pretty big selling point in the examples you're using, those who want to be able to benefit from the customization side of an app chain, but also don't have to worry about building up the security side of it too. Because again, there's obviously trade offs to that in other ecosystems. And if you think about the L one hype wave, a lot of these were already in, let's say, production were being built leading up to that. Some of them weren't, but that also stemmed from a problem that people were trying to find a solution for, which was congestion on ETH and on Ethereum, where you had gas prices that were through, especially in the NFT wave, is that really ramped up? You had insane gas wars between and at random times, you try to make it like a DeFi transaction, you'd be like, why the hell is Gary V's just smaller?"

Because I think nfts are going to be the gateway for most new web three entrants. That could very well be what sparks the next wave of this, the next push higher, because again, a lot of the pieces within the crypto economy or the crypto ecosystem benefit if that vision comes to fruition, because there's a lot more activity going on in the network and there's a lot more service area for new people to come in."

I think for me, one of them is the ripple case, because we just don't know how it's going to get ruled. And I don't think it's not ruling on ETh or anything else, but the market may fear getting deplatformed. And I think that could be something that could cause quite a hurdle here. I think all the leverage and most of the big level scamming and all of that concentration risk is gone. Obviously, binance is always a risk because it's such a large part of the market and lawsuits against binance. But I'm actually very bullish on Coinbase because of this. It's a fantastic position for Coinbase to be in. And then macro wise, I don't really see a macro risk in terms of inflation coming back yet. Sure, we could talk about that in 2024.

And what I mean by that is there were a lot of projects, a lot of companies, a lot of teams that raised back 2021, 2020, beginning, let's say, of 2022. And even well into 2022, public markets started to fall. Private valuations remain, as they typically do, remain pretty high, and started to certainly catch up to where the public market is now trading, but those are still relatively high. The scrutiny around projects and deal flow has certainly increased where the power has shifted away from in 2021, you're banging at the door trying to get into these top deals, and even just about every one of them was oversubscribed. Now, the benefit is the quality deal flow is certainly a lot higher in terms of venture bets that you want to be making. But there were a lot of products and teams that raised back in, let's say, 2021 that are probably coming up middle of 2023. Back half of 2023 are going to be coming back to market for new funding. And depending on whether or not funding conditions improve, I think that's going to be a pretty big risk, because at the end of the day, it takes money, it takes capital to build a lot of these things we're talking about and to continue to push this space forward. And especially when you're talking about developer talent, that's expensive talent. I think there's going to be a lot of teams that run into liquidity and potentially even insolvency issues because they just don't have access to that funding. Those funding conditions are not nearly as favorable as they were 18 months ago."

Listen, this is a binary option, let's give it a go, see if it works or not.

What makes crypto and web three interesting and kind of cool is that it is a bit behind the curtain. It is a bit of an insider's game today. But that being said, if you're able to create these experiences and increase that service area for new entrants to come in, well, that comes in with capital. That's another way in which you can have capital come into this space that isn't wholly dependent on this wave of institutions that everyone's talked about for years now, or even just pot dc money coming in and funding a lot of these early stage product teams or even later stage growth teams that have really scaled up. They've got actual businesses and they're just running headcount or overhead that's just way too high. That access to funding, that's a very critical source of liquidity for the crypto economy right now.

We rise up and then we correct. And then there's another scenario which I think what you're saying expresses, which is we actually don't rise as much.
