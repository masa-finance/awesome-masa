        "text": "Well, Nick, unfortunately, it is hard to say if there is more contagion risk out there or if there isn't. It's especially difficult because sometimes people will make these type of claims months in advance before they go down, but it's hard to separate the signal from the noise in all of those situations. But there are steps that individuals can take to protect themselves from that type of contagion risk."

        "text": "Yeah, unfortunately, it's anybody's guess. As we see, these have long tailwinds, as we saw in 2022, starting with Luna in May and ending with FTX, obviously in November. But individuals can be proactive in taking their money off of exchanges ahead of time. So then in case there is contagion risk, they're not left dealing with an exchange that is going bankrupt and losing all their coins."
