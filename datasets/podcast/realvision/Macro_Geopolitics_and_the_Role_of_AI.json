You see, this autumn we're launching the new Real Vision, a platform built around the universal truth that knowledge Times tools Times network equals success. Your success. It's the biggest transformation in our history and brings together everything you need in your journey from information to knowledge to wisdom, all in one place. That's incredible. AI, charting tools, networking, economic data, watch lists, notes, and a whole ton more. We start rolling out to our current members at the end of August, and from August 15 we're closing the doors to any new members while we focus on that. But you do have one final chance to get in that door. Until August 15, you can level up for a whole quarter of real vision just for the price of $20.14. When you go to realvision.com lastchance, you'll see why we chose that price in particular. It's something about real vision of old. You'll get to experience the new platform before the general public with no obligation to stay after that, three months and a price that works out for like $6 a month. It's what you call a no brainer. Anyway, I hope to see you on real vision. It's an incredible community and my God, this new platform is going to be extraordinary and will change as many lives as possible. That's realvision.com lastchance."

And he was essentially saying it's hard to sleep right now because there's so much happening in AI and in machine learning. And that's the way I feel. I mean, it appears we are at the beginnings of an intelligence explosion, just with profound consequences for the economy, for the culture, for our collective lives, our political lives. And I'm so interested to get into some of the geopolitical implications of that. I mean, it, it's huge. And we're just at the beginnings of figuring out are my top line thoughts on it. But Ash, I think you were talking a bit about real vision and its promotion before Dee jumped in."

If you're not currently a member, come and check it out. $20.14 for three months. It's obviously a great deal and a significant discount from the usual price. So come on in and check it out if you're not already a member. Guys, let me just sort of tee it up broadly, and maybe we could just go around again and get a bit of context from each one of you on what you think the current state of play in the world is. How would you describe at the 50,000 foot what we're seeing right now? Obviously, there are a lot of significant news stories we talked about some of them at the top of the show that are of threatening to break onto the surface here in a more significant way. So, Brent, first to you. What are your thoughts on the overall state of the world right now?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Brent well, so I guess the first word that kind of comes to mind is precarious, right. Doesn't mean that necessarily something is going bad going to happen, but I feel like the table is set, that if something does go wrong, a multitude of factors could potentially go wrong all at the same time. And the way I kind of liken it is, you know, if anybody has ever played sports before, as long as you're winning, you don't really have too many problems with the other people on the team, right? But the minute you lose a couple games and maybe you start getting into a slump now, you don't really like the way that guy passed you the ball, right? Or you don't really like the way that that guy, you know, called that time out at that certain point in the game, and you start kind of nitpicking all of these little things that didn't matter when you were winning, but now that you're losing, they start festering. And it's kind of the same thing, too, when, you know, when everybody's making money, there's no real problems, right? And you don't mind if somebody turns in a little bit bigger expense report, and you don't really mind if, you know, you don't close every deal. But then as the economy starts to turn down and you're not making money anymore, now you start focusing on those expense reports and closing that deal becomes a little bit more important. And I feel like that's where we're at now, because for a long time, the world was globalizing and we were in a very long bull market and we had interest rates going lower. And that provided a lot of cushion for a lot of things. And not only did it provide to the ability to make money, but it allowed a lot of other things to take place because people didn't have to focus so hard on making money, whether it's culture or politics or whatever it is. But now that interest rates have started to rise, globalization has hit that into the pendulum, and it's kind of starting to swing back the other way. And I feel like everything is just on the verge of a big battle, whether you're talking about politics or social movements or finance or military alignments or geopolitical trade unions. And I feel like everybody's kind of looking over their shoulder and just waiting for the next shoe to drop. And I don't know what the catalyst will be. All I know is that it's set perfectly, that if a catalyst does come along, we can kind of have all of these different things, politics, religion, economics, social movements kind of all run into the intersection at the exact same time. And I feel like it could just be a real big mess when that happens. So without putting too big of a doom and gloom bow on top of it, that's kind of my view of the world right now."

        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "Do you want to just go around the room. I'm happy to add. I think that your exact. I think that the thing that really impresses itself upon me is that all of these changes have happened at the same time, as you say. And that means the way I read that is that we're in a different kind of regime, we're in a different reality than we were. And I think it's not just these single things, interest rates or structural inflation or what have you. I think that it's a change in era, almost. And I think your observations are exactly right, that it's much more troubling to people. But I think that in itself is actually a part of the causal chain and maybe even a causal loop. And I think that one way to look at this is that it has to do with the complexity of the global environment. And, you know, one of the really interesting things about science in the late 20th century was how much we discovered about complex systems as we got larger computer models and more computer power and how they create order and disorder on their own and their feedback loops and hidden links and unintended, unexpected consequences. And there's an inherent unstableness or fragility as certain conditions come up and you get these tipping points and cascading phenomena and so forth. And I think that that has essentially created a level of uncertainty that human beings find it very difficult to live with. And markets are human constructs, and society is a human construct. Emotional valence, the emotional response that we have to these things has very real world effects. And I would go as far as to say that the complexity and the uncertainty, radical uncertainty. By radical, I mean that the near future looks less and less like the recent past is actually making people, to some extent, deranged and even delusional, and it affects the way they act. That causes more unpredictability, and therefore, it just strengthens the cycle."

        "text": "Yeah, I can go. I just think the problem, Raoul, is that Dee can't hear. For some reason, Dee can't hear Ash, so he can't hear Ash's moderation. But, yeah, I'm certainly happy to add some thoughts to that. I mean, I would echo the thoughts we've heard so far. I think my picture from 50,000ft, as you ask for Ash, is, look, I think we've lived for a few decades inside what you might call a liberal fantasy that we can progress towards a world that is free from conflict. We can progress towards some kind of universal, shared liberal nirvana, and that, in fact, technology will help us progress to that universal, shared, conflict free utopia where we all agree the best condition for our collective lives and the right way to go about organizing our society. We're getting some very hard lessons now in how that is just never the case. It never has been the case in human history, and it just won't ever be. Humans are just too complex, too variegated, too contradictory to ever settle on one agreed form of life. And technology, if anything, only sort of accentuates those tendencies. The most powerful force on the planet is about to be super intelligence. And the huge question is, and it's a very destabilizing question, who gets there first? And what kind of super intelligence do they build, and what values and what forms of life and forms of thinking is sort of instantiated and manifested in that superintelligence? And we're going to have a global race, a kind of arms race, or a new kind of arms race to get there. And look, this is where geopolitics comes in, and I know we're here to talk about that. Partly that race will depend upon compute power. One of the big stories we read about in the last few days is Biden finally signing this act, saying, you can't invest in chinese AI companies, chinese chip makers. He just wants to make it much harder for China to get there first. That's going to be a huge new nexus of conflict. We're all kind of obsessed with two movies right now. One's about Barbie, one's about the race to the atom bomb. We're about to. We're having a race to super intelligence. It has profound geopolitical consequences. It's a nexus of conflict, obviously, absolutely fascinating for someone like me, but huge and sometimes scary implications. That is, I guess, a part, a big part of my view from 50,000ft. Back to you, Ash."

        "text": "So I want to tie together a lot of what everybody's saying and simplify it down. We are going through one of the fastest, most uncertain periods of change in all human history, and this is not going to stop. And it's driven by the multipolar world and the competition that has developed within it. And as David said, it's for compute, it's for oil, it's for data, it's for control, it's for so many things. And it's all happening at the same time that we are having to deal with a breakdown of de cover this at length. A lot in a world on a brink, which was the multi part documentary series he made for us at real vision, which is mind blowing. And a lot in this is like, not only is the institutional infrastructure of the world changing, we're losing faith in the institutions and we will end up rebuilding them. But we've got this pace of technology changing, where suddenly humans are not the only people who possess knowledge, which is something David's talked about to the very system of money itself. And all of these things are happening. And I'd throw in if we want to add in scare stories, but also inspiring stories, because all of these things are inspiring and scary is what are nation states going to do with Gene editing and AI? What's going to happen when quantum computing, all of these are coming not like 20 years time, they're all coming over the next five to ten years. So the scale of change that humanity is going to have to deal with is going to be really, really hard, because these are all exponentials as well. They're not just a subtle general change where some superpower takes some extra space in the world. That's not what we're dealing with here. Every single fabric of our lives are changing. How we operate, how we talk to each other, how we communicate, how we move around, how we process information. Everything is changing. So at a very macro level, what a time to be alive, terrifying and exciting all at the same time."

And I know people have lots of different ideas about climate change, but we haven't seen entire towns and villages and even cities burn down until very recently. There was one in Canada a couple of years ago, much smaller. And then Lahaina was an important city. And these sorts of things that are highly unexpected are also going to impact this concatenation, whatever word you want to use, of change that we're facing. And the resource question that is driven both by resource availability and also bye. By conflict. Food, all of these things are another element that in addition to the kinds of things that you mentioned, which are all absolutely there, I would go back, I don't know if you could hear what I was saying, but I think that social fragmentation and disintegration that we're seeing is partly a consequence of the rapid level of change and the emotional instability that it causes in people, and that then reflects in the choices they make in terms of markets, in terms of geopolitics, in terms of all of these factors. So it's like a feedback. It's like a massive feedback loop."

Look, I'm very bullish on all of it and what it could mean for mankind, but change is what the hard part is and how we navigate that change if it makes us super productive human beings and gives us more free time and does a bunch of things. Okay, that's interesting. But also, as Dee says, these kind of frictions, what it creates for people, is hard. So it is going to be a very scary time. I think in the end, it comes like everything with good things and bad things. Good things is humans will live longer, humans will live healthier, humans can be more productive. They might have more free time. They'll be able to do things that we've never deemed possible before. I mean, if you lower the cost of energy and increase productivity by AI and quantum computing. It's a completely different world. What is possible is extraordinary. Dee, do you mind putting yourself on mute? So I think that is an extraordinary world. But the downside is dealing with change, the potential for conflict. We're already seeing it, all of that. It's going to be volatile."

But I guess the point I wanted to make is that even though all this stuff is very scary, and even though I tend to believe that we are going to have some kind of a crisis as we go through this fourth turning, that kind of encapsulate all of this. I don't think that you can also just move to the sidelines, move to a mountaintop in Montana and come back in ten years, because I literally think the world might pass you by in those ten years. And the world you come back to ten years from now may look radically different and potentially, again, this is not necessarily my core stance, but potentially radically better. Right. And so I don't think you bet everything on the crisis. I think you prepare for the crisis. I think you understand the factors that could cause it to happen and have some protection in case it does. But there's, it could go the other way, I guess, is the point that I would encourage everybody to keep an open mind to."

I mean, like you said, we have a constellation of technologies emerging that are going to sort of smash us into multiple exponential changes all at once. And so much of it, you know, as we've talked about endlessly, and I've written about in GMI, is underlain. Bye. By intelligence, by the abundance of a new form of intelligence, and that is machine intelligence. And it's just going to be transformational in ways that we find very difficult to understand at the moment. I think we're going to see value creation, the like of which we've never seen across the last two, three decades. I mean, like you said, AI is going to be just this sort of deflationary mega bomb across the economy. It's going to enable productivity gains, or it's likely to enable productivity gains that are of absolutely astounding. We're going to start to see that play out across, for example, as you mentioned, the life sciences. We're starting to see that soon, and perhaps we'll get a chance to talk about that later. But it's going to create a wave of social and geopolitical fractiousness and destabilization that we're going to have to contend with. I suspect some form of crisis event will come of that. But we're just wonderfully adaptable creatures, and we'll find a way to adapt. And the promise in sight is of a world that is, for billions of people, just radically better. I mean, as we've talked about, Rao, what can we do when the marginal cost of electricity is essentially zero? We can build that world endless, pretty much infinite, clean energy. What can we do with that. These are huge questions. There's going to be a period of instability, but I think we get to the other side of it with a world that is much better for most people."

        "text": "You know, I see it as both. I certainly don't discount what David's saying as a possibility, but I also would caution about the number of things that can go wrong. You know, there are some people like Pippa Malmgren, who also does a lot with real vision, who believe world War three has already begun. And I think that there's a possibility that that's correct. We don't see the conflict in Ukraine, for example, as winding down. We don't see the potential conflicts between the US and China and between the US and its allies in East Asia and China winding down. We see the opposite. And I think that we're in this period of global split, which is very dangerous because it brings back the politics of balance of power, and that's what led to world War one and world War two, where you have lots of different powers and the balance is very fragile. And I think that we also have these structural problems like migration. There's somewhere north of 70 million displaced peoples both internally in countries and moving between countries. Now. That number may triple or quadruple by the end of the decade. And what do you do with all those people? And so, you know, I think that I agree with the idea that there's no problem we have that we can't solve. I also am concerned with the path from getting. Of getting from here to there. And I'll bring up one other thing, which is food and water would be, you could include it in it or look at it separately. But in the US, for example, we waste 30% to 40% of our food, and yet 800 million people go hungry. And a lot of getting to the world that David's talking about is going to require living a different way so that we, for example, don't waste 30 to 40. And so that's, you know, that is a. I just look at this through the lens. You know, that I'm. Of course, that's my job is to, is to look at risk and threats. And so I tend to be oriented in that direction. But I agree we can get through it. I just. I'm concerned about tipping points between here and there, you know, of which the most, you know, the most radical would be existential nuclear war being the obvious one. But bio error, bio terror, all these things that have been mentioned, it's not going to be an easy path to navigate. I don't want to be Downer, but that's how I see it."

I know you talk about this a lot, but it's part of this very big picture. So do you want to give us a bit of a run through of that and how that all fits in?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, so I think, as I said at the very beginning, I think part of this whole de globalization and confrontation kind of go together, and I do not. If you look at the way the monetary system is designed and don't have time to go into all the details of it, but it says because it's a debt based system, it has to grow. If it doesn't grow, then it crashes on a very basic level. And so we've gotten to this point where based on the growth that we have now, based on the types of energy and technology that we have now, growth is no longer enough to outrun the debt. As a result, the whole global growth is slowing and interest rates are starting to rise. And so it's throwing this whole system into potential crisis. The only way, in my opinion, to not have this crisis is to grow out of it. So again, as we said, if because of this new technology that we're having, we are somehow able to turbo boost global growth at a level that is greater than the cost of the debt, then we can continue on without a crisis. But barring that, then I think there is going to be a crisis. And I think there's been a lot of talk over the last, let's just call it decade. You can probably go back further than that about a transition to a new monetary system. And that is often, you know, equated with the dollar no longer being the global reserve currency. And the point that I've tried to make to people is not necessarily that the dollar will always be the global reserve currency. It probably will not be. These things typically don't last. However, I do not see a way to transition from this system to another system that is not hyper volatile economically. That is probably not possible without military action. In other words, if the system were to move away from the dollar, that process would be extremely hard, because that would mean that the whole world would have to deleverage. And we all know from history that governments don't like to deleverage, right? There's so much pain that goes along with deleveraging, that they just don't want to do it. But that's what the rest of the world would have to do if they were to de dollarize. So I don't think they have the ability to de dollarize without creating incredible volatility economically. And then the second part is, if they did somehow figure out a way to de dollarize and deleverage without super economic volatility, I don't think that the US, as the current hegemon would just sit back and let it happen. I think they would try to reinforce their position as the hegemon and keep their role as the global superpower. So I cannot figure out a way that we go from a current monetary system to some new monetary system that either isn't chaotic or that doesn't still have the US kind of sitting at the top of the pyramid. And I think all of that stuff is going to happen. And this is why I think we are going to have some kind of a crisis. Now, whether this happens tomorrow or five years from now, I'm not smart enough to know that. I just think that that's where we're headed."

And that's another huge battle we're seeing, whether it's in cryptocurrencies or whether it's over. The control of AI is who controls this world. And it's not just about nation states, it's about individuals as well. So it feels that that's another battleground in this fourth turning. That's yet to be proven out. I don't know where that goes either, but it's all part of the same thing. There's a huge battle for the new structure, this, you know, what does the new global world order look like at the end of all of this?"

We're going to go back towards regions or individual countries or state powers and less cooperation. But I also feel like in, within each country, I feel like power is going to get more centralized. And I think this is going to happen because as countries come under threat, you know, as the governments or the organization, the institutions themselves come under threat, I think that they are going to try, at least, at least try to centralize power. So on the one hand, I see on the big picture decentralization globally. But I feel like we're going to have concentration of power internally in nation states. And so that causes all kinds of social issues as well. It's not just economic, it's not just political.

        "text": "You know, I think that Brent's observations were just right on the mark across the board in terms of his issues about debt and de dollarization and so forth, in terms of sovereignty and in terms of centralization and decentralization. I think that there are, as with so many things right now, two very powerful moving forces. One is the global splintering into these essentially spheres of influence, and you can see them forming. There's one developing between China and Russia, which Russia will probably be a vassal state of China if it stays together, which is another big question. You can see it, the US forming a whole new set of alliances. There's the Aukus, the quad in the Indo Pacific and so forth. And you can also see the effects of the Ukraine war. He wanted to try to destroy NATO, and what he did is make NATO great again. Putin. And so I think that you're seeing a. And it depends on the scale that you're looking at. In a way, you're seeing a central. It's what Brent was saying, but I would apply it even larger that you're seeing these various groups of nations come together and coalesce around certain ideas, values, political systems, and coalesce in opposition to one another. And so that's what I meant when I mentioned that it's a very dangerous state of affairs. It's called balance of power in foreign policy or geopolitics. And because the balance is fragile, it can very easily lead to war. And honestly, I think that we're seeing that kind of thing happening where the world is heading towards war. Nationalism, always a precursor of war. But there's also, within nations, so much disarray in terms of people with diametrically opposite values and ideas. And this is not just the US. It certainly is the US, but it's in every country in Europe, and it's in countries like India and Egypt. And I did these places talk to people and they, you know, there is a. A very serious divide. It's not always 50 50. Sometimes it's into multiple pieces, but it's really pulling these countries apart. So I think this is one reason why this is not a place we've been before, because you've got both centrifugal and centripetal forces at work at the same time, highly complex and highly volatile. And it's very difficult to have any assurance that a country like Russia, for example, will actually stay together. And even the US, you know, I would not put it off the charts at all that we have political violence within the US coming up to in the next election cycle. So, you know, I think, again, it's the complexity and the unpredictability of it, which has just gone off the charts. And it makes it very much more likely that the kinds of things that Brent was talking about are actually going to happen. And the problem with that is that once they start to happen, it's hard to put the brakes on them, and particularly international conflict. And the other thing I would add to that, last thing I would add, is that we're not just dealing with nations that are sometimes not well glued together and conflicts between nations. We're dealing with non state actors, which are increasingly powerful. And those range from cartels to organizations like ISIS or you don't hear much about it right now, but Hezbollah and so forth, these non state actors that have become real power players. Latin America is being beset by a whole range of real serious destabilization driven by a lot of non state actors. So it's becoming a situation that's almost more complex than we can apprehend."

David, you've also looked at this trend of centralization, decentralization written about the trends in AI and how we've got the battle between, let's say, OpenAI and people like stability and others. We've seen in decentralized computing power, cryptocurrencies, and even decentralized energy grids. How are you thinking of that trend of decentralization versus whether it's mega corporations or state level stuff?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "G",
        "text": "Yeah, I think this polarity, centralization and decentralization is just fundamental to so much that's going on. And there's a few, I mean, there's a few things I'd say about it. Picking up on some of the stuff that was just talked about. I think we're about to see first is I think we're about to see just an intense competition between two models of organizing a society. If you look at what's happening in China, they're building a highly centralized form of techno authoritarianism, essentially the like of which we've never seen before. And they're doing that by leveraging, by taking control of their technology sector. And we've seen them do that, seen the CCP do that across the last couple of years, last few years. Take control of your technology sector and roll out an absolutely vast network of AI and facial recognition technologies that just tracks every citizen and who they are and what they're doing and where on the street they are and what they're doing in front of their screens at all times. Just totally AI fueled, centralized control of 1.4 billion people. I mean, that's simplistic, but that's the model. And the challenge for the global north is that that might turn out across many dimensions to be the most effective form of governance and the most efficient way of organizing a society we've ever seen. I mean, it's a very commonplace observation, but I'll make it again very quickly. The problem with authoritarianism historically, is that the people at the centre of power, in the end, just can't process enough information, and just can't keep track of what's going on fast enough and well enough to operate efficiently. But now you don't have to have people at the centre processing information. You can have intelligence, machine intelligence at the centre processing information. What does that do to make highly, highly centralized, authoritarian forms of government possible? As liberal democracies in the global north fray and are fractious and face all this economic turbulence, there will be, I fear, an increasing tendency to look over to that model and notice the ways that it's operating more effectively and more efficiently. And we risk that. Or there is a danger that, that adds to the ways in which liberal democracies fray and people lose patience with them, and people start to yearn for something more centralized. And we sort of lose touch with the global north, with the legacy of pluralism and democracy that we built over the course of centuries. That is one big sort of mega trend I see approaching, and it's a destabilizing megatrend. I talked at the beginning. The second big thing I'd say is I talked at the beginning about how the most powerful force on the planet is about to be super intelligence. And there's a huge discussion to be had about who we allow to build and control that, and then what values are manifested in it. What I love about stability, aih, is that therefore, a world where, okay, if we're going to have this incredibly powerful new form of intelligence, it should be decentralized. We should decentralize the ability to sort of build and control and work with it. And different communities should be able to build their own intelligence agents that manifest their own values and beliefs and forms of life. And I think that is the sort of a million AI's can bloom sort of future that I would like to see emerge. But again, the danger is that a few highly centralized, powerful actors, I mean, Microsoft, OpenAI, the CCP, build all conquering super intelligence that just imposes its values on the rest of us and in that way essentially sort of erodes, if not destroys, the democracies in the global north at least that we live in. So there's going to be a contest there between highly centralized forms of intelligence and decentralized, sort of ground up AI by and for the people forms of forms of intelligence. And there's no way of knowing which way that's going to go yet, which."

We are still talking about and holding Senate committees about and deliberating and trying to legislate for Facebook and Instagram and Twitter or x now and its impact on our collective lives and our political lives. So the idea that we can do anything meaningful in the timeframe allowed to sort of at all ameliorate the impact that generative AI and AI is about to have on this election cycle is just clearly is not going to happen. And what you're going to have is just a whole ton of deep fakes, a whole ton of misinformation, and great. And that makes it impossible for anyone to know what is genuine and what is not. I mean, there are some glimmers of hope there. It probably is the case that as others have observed, the big challenge for anyone who really wants to misinform people to spread disinformation is not the creation of the disinformation it's the distribution building. The audience is getting it out there and making it go viral. Can AI, can these generative AI tools really help you with that? Well, perhaps not so much, but we're still going to get an absolute shit ton of content. That's just false, confusing. That's misleading. It's going to be produced domestically. It's probably going to be produced by external actors, too. We're bumping up against limits in all kinds of ways. In all kinds of ways. Technologies are bumping us up against a set of fundamental limits in this century. And one of the fundamental limits we're bumping up against is we're doing 19th century politics. We're doing a 19th century version of liberal democracy in a 21st century now machine intelligence world. And I'm just not sure it functions anymore. Yeah.

And if Biden wins again or whoever run, there is no way the Republicans will accept it. So I think, and the thing is, this is going to go a little bit off script here is a lot of times what we talk about is, you know, finance and money and economics, and how are we going to profit from all this, either madness or innovation. Right. But I really think that one of the most important investments that people can make over the next year is their personal relationships with people that they don't necessarily agree with. And I don't say that to be funny. I, like, I'm actually being extremely serious because I think that is going to be the biggest challenge over the next 18 months, is the social aspect of it. And I think you're going to have to, if you want to get through it, I think you're going to have to learn to talk with people that you don't agree with. And I think you're going to have to learn to deal with or live in a world that you don't necessarily personally 100% agree with without losing your mind and keeping some form of sanity. And so I think in today's world, especially with all the hot takes, the Twitter and, you know, the social media and the deep fakes and this outrage and, you know, the age of outrage, I think you're going to have to learn to keep your head. And I know I'm kind of joking, but I'm really serious. Like, I think that is going to be one of the most important things. So, you know, I think you got to really work on your own community, and whether that's a community, like, real vision that helps you kind of see through the madness or whether it's your family members or the community which, in which you physically live in, like, I think that's going to be a very important investment that people make over the next year."

        "text": "You know, I would go back, first of all, to the quote that you'll remember we used in real vision from Eo Wilson, which is that we've created a Star wars civilization of Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. And I think that goes to to what both David and Brent were saying, which is that we're coming up against some limits. And that, I think, is the fundamental thing. I think we've created a world that's changing technologically and socially more rapidly than we can adapt as humans and that our systems can adapt and that possibly even the planetary biological system can adapt. And so I think that that, you know, again, I don't know how much of what I said at the beginning, everybody heard, but I think that there's a fundamental level at which the level of change and the pace of change and the scope of change are driving us, in a way, insane. And so people, when that happens, they hearken back to, they want stability, and they hearken to a simplified version of the belief systems that they have. And so that begins to fracture societies into things that have an excluded middle. And to put it in the terms Aristotle, to say whether you have people on one side and people on the other, and very few who will at least admit that they see both sides. And so while I agree 100% with what Brent has said, I'm skeptical and depressed about the, our ability to do that in the current situation. And I think that the AI aspects and the disinformation and misinformation and deepfakes and all that are going to simply empower what's already going on. And this is a Nexus point, I think, in a lot of ways, I think, I guess it was, David said that at the beginning, we're at a nexus point in a bunch of ways right now, and the US election is going to be kind of the pinnacle of that nexus point. And I'm really concerned about it. I'm very concerned about social violence with what happens. I think that it's correct that either side is not going to accept that the other side wins, even if it's a landslide. We averted the worst of it the last time. I'm very concerned about it this time. I wish someone would get the messages out that Brent mentioned about trying to have more consilience, trying to see the other side of things, but it's just not the way the spirit of the times is going. So I'm really concerned about it. I'm concerned about it all across the spectrum from messaging. And I do think there are lots of external actors who would love nothing more than to see the entire superstructure of american democracy collapse. And a lot of those are state level actors and they have a lot of resources to throw at it. And there are non state actors that also are at play. And so I'm really concerned that we're not prepared for what's coming down the pike. If the train is heading straight for us, we can see the headlights of it and it is heading straight for us. And I'm not sure what the, what the, what the, what a actionable solution would be to it. I can see that, you know, I can see how you could do it, but I can't see how you implement it in a way that is going to ameliorate enough of this rancor and this, you know, hatred of the, when both sides, when they both regard the other as evil, not just wrong, but evil, then you've got a real problem. And, you know, there's been a lot of research in the last few years about, about human decision making and human perception. And one of the net nets out of it is that we're built for trust, not for truth. And so we create communities. And those communities, we then give them our trust. And so that, unfortunately, it can work for you, but it can also work against you when you have highly polarized communities. And that's where we are. And technology has hugely empowered that by allowing us to find people who agree with us and get into these little bubbles. And so, you know, it's just, it's not a good situation any way you look at it."

And just to pick up on some points that everyone made this idea of places, trusted sources, and community. Real vision right now is going to be starting on August 15. That's today, folks. We'll be closing the doors for new members while we put the final touches on our new real Vision 2.0 platform. Raoul, you and I have done a bunch of AMA's around it. It's pretty extraordinary, not just in its ability to convey information, but in its ability to connect community and also some of the AI stuff we're doing under the hood. It's going to be pretty amazing when that gets launched. But we are shutting the doors today. But we want to give everyone who's listening to this conversation, which I think has been an extraordinary one, but is representative of the kind of conversations that we have on real vision, the opportunity to come in now for three months for $20.14. It's like $6 a month. It's kind of a no brainer if you're interested in hearing conversations like this, Raoul, anything else to add?"
