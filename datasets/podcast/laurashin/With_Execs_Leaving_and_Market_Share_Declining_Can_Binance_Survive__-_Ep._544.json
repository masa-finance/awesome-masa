There have been a number of news events related to finance over the last several months to the point where there are now a number of questions swirling around the exchange in its future about potential regulatory and possibly even criminal actions against the exchange and its founders. And then, of course, what all of this could mean for the crypto industry if the exchange that has been the biggest crypto exchange for the last six years either falls or at the very least, loses its top spot. So, Steven, can you start by giving us kind of the main events or highlights of what has been happening with binance over the last several months, including another big event this week, that have brought binance to really what feels like an existential point in its story?"

        "text": "Sure. How much time do you have? Because it could take. I think this is just a 30 minutes show. But no, in crypto, we feel like every day is a week, every week is a year. Every year is a decade. And for Binance, there's been no shortage of big news. When FTX collapsed in November and left CZ as the big 800 pound gorilla that really was kind of lording over all of crypto, there were a lot of thoughts that, hey, maybe this is Binance's moment. It was already the biggest exchange in the world by a large margin, and it just became so much bigger and even more systemically significant. It's been a very difficult year for Binance, just beginning with the fact that in the 60 days post collapse of FTX, more than $12 billion worth of customer deposits left the exchange. A colleague of mine, our terrific director of data and analytics, Javier Paz, put together a report just talking about these massive investor outflows that Binance has really worked to try to stem. Ever since then, the hits kept coming. I believe it was in February that the New York Department of Financial Services forced Paxos, which was the issue of Binance's stablecoin busdhead, which at one point, I believe reached over $20 billion in market cap and was seen as a legitimate competitor to circles USDC and the biggest stable coin of all, Tether, which has a market cap of 83, $84 billion or so. But DF's forced them to shut it down. I believe that was that order was also issued concurrently with something that came out of the SEC as well, and that was a really big hit for Binance. It might not have been quite as flashy as the suits from the CFTC and SEC that came in later, but if you're just talking about dollar terms and financial impact, it was massive, because Binance was really trying to make BUsD the biggest stakeholder in the world. They had incentives to encourage trading with BUSD. And in particular, think about what people do, and obviously, Lara, you know this, and many people in your audience do as well. When you have $20 billion or $40 billion or $80 billion in cash, you can invest it in treasuries or money markets that are paying 5% annual returns. I mean, that's an incredible amount of money that you can make virtually risk free, especially in a market like today, where trading volumes are dwindling, reserves are dwindling. It's a really nice way to sort of supplement assets. So that's, that's one thing that happened. In March, the CFTC sued Binance, where a suite of charges, a lot of it stems from the CFTC's allegations that Binance was operating as an FCM, a futures commodity merchant. That basically saying that they're offering like options and futures contracts at various digital assets without registering with the agency, which is required to do in the United States. And then in particular, and this much like the SEC's suit which came out in June, they both talked about efforts. Binance went to not only like let us customers participate on the exchange, but actually help them find ways to get around geo blocking activities that they put in to make sure that the best customers could still trade on the exchange. There's the CFTC lawsuit in March. There is the SEC lawsuit that came in June. There are rumors that the DOJ is investigating binance and they would bring criminal charges. CFTC and SEC are sort of civil endeavors which would kind of lead to fines and maybe bars from trading and certain activities. But obviously DOJ could bring criminal penalties if they bring such charges and are able to get CZ into custody. And then there's other aspects too, as well. Binance has been losing payment and banking partners around the world. Binance US in June had to become a crypto only exchange because they lost their banking partners in the US. So they couldnt handle us dollars anymore. They lost their auditor in January. And then on top of that too, just a wave of executive departures going from the c suite to country manager. So this is a lot for one particular exchange, any company really, but, but an exchange as consequential as Binance to deal with."

        "text": "It's really been just an onslaught of bad news after bad news. I mean, there's been a few glimmers of new product initiatives and things like that, but a few other stats I want to throw in, there are that spot volumes. In terms of its market share, it had about 60% of all crypto exchange volume, market share at the beginning of the year. Now, for the last few months, it's been at 45%, and they laid off 1000 people. And then actually, let's also now mention the executive departure this week that was at Binance us. Tell us about that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So binance, as you rightfully said, has been losing market share. They remain the largest crypto exchange in the world, but they are losing market share in this dwindling market. I actually believe the latest numbers that came out from CC data put Binance's spot market share at least at around 37, 38%. And if you're just looking at their spot volumes, they were comfortably still above $20 billion daily, even beginning of the year. Now it's down to about 5 billion at the peak. At peak 2021, it was over 60 billion. So, I mean, just think about exchanges make money by taking small cuts of every exchange. And if your volume goes down 80% or whatever, I mean, that's money that you're no longer getting. And obviously, that's very consequential. And then with the executive departures, as you said, that's something that I know CZ has tried to gloss over. I know when we've reached out to some of the departed executives and they've either responded to us or to just public Twitter postings, etcetera, I mean, they kind of said things like, we want to take care of a family, the time is right. There was no acrimony involved, so on and so forth. But at some point, all this takes the toll. And at least with regards to binance, us, which is the us ethic franchise, is the term that they like to use for that particular exchange. They're in a very tenuous situation right here. I mean, even before. And I'll talk about Brian Schroeder's departure in a second. I believe right now, I just checked the numbers before we recorded this. They're averaging about 20 million, not, not, not billion, not 200 million, but $20 million a day in transaction volume, 10 million of which is bitcoin. I believe that. I think they charge something like ten basis points per trade. So if you think about that, like 20 million times 0.1, I'm not really good at doing math in my head. I use a calculator for that, despite the fact that I'm a financial journalist. But you can just think about the. How little money that actually is coming in. Obviously, since binance us was created in 2019, there's always been issues and questions about its independence from the larger exchange. And would it actually be able to find that sweet spot of separating itself in the eyes of regulators while maintaining the secret sauce that is made by NASA love brand by many customers. And they've gone through three CEO's at this point. Brian Schroeder just resigned. I was speaking with some sources familiar with binance us, and I was basically told that this was not a planned departure, that the 100 person layoff was, but the removal of CEO Brian Schroeder, the exit of him was not. I've also been told that it's important to keep an eye out for some of his key lieutenants now, because remember, when he joined, one of the first things that he did was raise a $200 million, actually seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation. That's something Brian Brooks, his predecessor, had wanted to, but he wasn't able to finish it. Brian Schroeder did. And then for part of that, that saw Binance us as a growth company, he brought in some key lieutenants, chief legal officers, chief risk officers. And I think that now that binance us is moving away from obviously growth, like any exchange, to sort of conservation, it's important to look at some people you brought in and they may be looking to leave. And actually, one of the sources I was just speaking with told me that their chief risk officer, Sidney Majala, and I want to look at my notes to make sure I don't get the names wrong. And head of legal, Krishna Jubeldi, have actually, emails that have been sent to them by some of the other rank and file have started to bounce back. So I don't know if that necessarily means that they may have already left. But certainly I think it's important to, now that Brian is gone, see if some of those people that he brought in after he raised this big round with a lot of high expectations if they are going to follow suit."

        "text": "Overtimemarkets XYZ back to my conversation with Stephen. So, as we discussed earlier in the show, there's this lawsuit by the CFTC against finance and its executives, and that document laying that out, it had some pretty, I guess, shocking, you know, details of chats amongst the executives, you know, appear to be turning a blind eye to money laundering and things like that. But, you know, when you look at sort of all, you know, the CFJC one, the SEC, then there's these hints around, you know, potential criminal action by the Department of Justice. What are your thoughts around that? Like, why have we not actually seen an action from DOJ yet? Because there have been a few things that have been linked, like in the Wall street journal. I think the department is potentially internally arguing about whether or not they even have enough information to actually go after them. But go ahead and sum that up and tell us your thoughts on sort of what really is hanging over its head when it comes to the regulatory sphere."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Lara, I'm glad you asked this question, because I try to think of it in a few different ways. I mean, for one, the allegations, and again, as graphic and shocking as they are, as you kind of alluded to in the CFTC and SEC's complaint, again, there are still allegations. Until this gets, gets proven in court, and obviously Binance has, and binance us in particular, has chosen to defend itself. My source actually at Binance us, told me that they feel someone emboldened by Ripple's at least modicum of success against the SEC in its respective lawsuit, especially with relation to the summary judgment that cited that programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute legal securities offerings. But all that aside, regarding the DOJ, it's hard to know because these enforcement agencies are very tight lipped. It takes a while to build a case. And again, if you go back and read the CFTC and SEC's complaints, which we both have done, they're incredibly detailed. So that stuff doesn't quite happen over overnight. And when there is something to be revealed, it will be revealed. But I think another interesting way to look at the question is what would be the impact of all of this? I mean, again, like the Scorchman bans from participating in regulated activities are sure that's something. It's legitimate to wonder about the future of binance. Us. With everything going on here, the DOJ can't bring criminal charges. But I mean, CZ, I'm sure, has been following what's going on with Sam Beckman. Fried is going on trial a couple of weeks, and if the DOJ brings charges, I suspect he'll be very careful to make sure he doesn't step into the US or any country with some sort of extradition treaty with the US. So if the idea is that finance may not, or at least the Binance international exchange may not face any major real, real penalties from all this under mishap fallout, then what's the harm? I think the harm then comes from just customer sentiment. One of the other. I was reading an article yesterday that highlighted how while binance is losing market share in the market, they're not losing it to people like Coinbase, they're losing it to some of these other smaller exchanges that are still dabbling in those exotic tokens that don't quite have some of the reputational baggage that Binance has brought on. Customer fear about seizures, customer fear about. And the SEC lawsuit in particular talked about commingling funds, allegations of commingling funds and funneling like $20 billion of customer funds to trading firms. Meritpeak and I believe the other one was called signum, that binance controls, one of which was allegedly used to facilitate wash trading of binance us. Those are things that are going to cause customers. Thanks Pavia. Paz and I published an investigation in March where we documented how Binance took at least $1.8 billion for wallet, meant to be collateral for stablecoins issued by binance, and used it to make more busd. So things like that are what can cause customers to that loss of trust, even among people that may not trust governments themselves or the us government in particular. That's what could really hurt them. I think, most, most importantly, and there."

        "text": "Is another really interesting development from late August, which is that the SEC submitted a document in its case against Binance under Seal. And John Reed Stark, the former eleven year chief of the SEC's office of Internet Enforcement, tweeted that he couldn't even recall seeking to file a motion or any other court document under seal. He was saying, because the SEC does civil actions, not criminal actions, that all of it. Not all, but, you know, like the vast majority of its actions are public. And he had a few theories about why it might have been filed sealed. You know, what have you seen in terms of the theories about, you know, why that was?"

        "text": "Yeah, this is a fun one. I'll call it the crypto Schrodinger's cat for anybody that follows psychology or has watched the big Bang theory, because really, it could be anything. I mean, it could be the smoking gun that brings down binance, the entire crypto world. Obviously, I'm kind of being a bit jocular here, but it also could be something, I wouldn't say the word benign, because obviously these are, I mean, these are serious documents, but it could be as simple as information containing PII, personally identifiable information, which if you're in the US, or I guess we're talking about the US here, falls under pretty strict protections. And that has to be, that has to be safeguarded. And really nobody knows. It could be one or the other. It could be something in between. And obviously, I saw John, we, Stark's comments, actually saw him speak last Thursday at a conference, a fintech conference hosted by the Philadelphia Fed. Sources within binance us have told me that they're not entirely sure what's in it either. And then I also spoke with a lawyer or two that aren't involved in the case, but are obviously very well informed about just securities regulations, securities enforcement, and everything going on. And they also told me that there's really no way to know until or if they get unsealed and anything else. I mean, obviously John Stark has had a long background. I mean, he's certainly an educated person and speaks from a position of authority, but the only people that truly know are the ones that drafted documents. And the only thing I would say is to people not to jump to conclusions one way or another. We'll find out soon enough if we need to."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, but one of the theories that I did want to mention, it goes back to the earlier question about the DOJ. They were saying that potentially the document might have revealed details about either a criminal investigation by DOJ or. Or they might have just wanted to seal it to protect informants or whistleblowers. And there was even a theory that Sam Binkman freed might be the person who was informing on binance."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, in this industry, anything is believable. And all those. I mean, to be frank, all those seem plausible to me as well. I mean, the DOJ has brought a number of criminal indictments on, often concurrently or shortly following suits and filed by the civil authorities. So, again, I wouldn't be surprised about anything, and I would definitely not be surprised if the DOJ brings action against binance. I think it's important for people to just be careful about. And again, it could be something horrible. It could not. But the idea that it's some sort of red smoking gun, that's going to be the end of all this. It could be, but there's also a good chance that it's not. And I think that's it, where it's important for people to kind of calibrate expectations."

        "text": "Yeah. So speaking of FTX, let's just address one of the rumors that I've seen floating around, which is that binance could be another FTX. I'm sure you've seen some accounts floating this theory, and by that, I think what they mean is that it's insolvent, and if all the customers try to withdraw their funds, then there wouldn't be enough crypto assets to meet all the redemptions. What do you think of this? Is there any evidence to indicate that this is the case? Why do you think this theory is being floated?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Another great question, Laura. There's plenty of reasons why this theory is being floated. Again, these are two of the three largest exchanges in the world, at least going back to when FTX was in operation. Binance, just like FTX, is run by a very strong figurehead that has, I would say, a cult following within the crypto ecosystem. The fortunes of the company are very much tied into belief in the capability of this leader. They both offer what's called an exchange token, which is kind of, sort of like stock, but not really. And people, they offer certain trading benefits and other, like, other valuable things, but don't offer any actual equity or in the company, but people buy them because their fortunes are seen to be tied to the fortress of the founder. But I think probably the biggest reason, and you kind of hinted at it, is questions of whether or not binance is solvent. Theyve gone through a few different exercises, putting out proofs of reserve I know they did one with an accounting firm called Nazars that ended up dropping them and the entire crypto practice. I believe they now publish a proof of reserves on their own website, which is good. But as you know, and im sure plenty of people listening know too, a proof of reserve is not even close to an audit. An audit will look at flows in and out over time. It'll look at liabilities to make sure that assets are not encumbered elsewhere. And it just goes into a lot more proof of reserve. Sometimes I call it like staging a house, like if you know where, when it's going to be, you can bring in funds to make sure you match it. And then you could say, well, if you do a proof of reserve every two days, maybe then it's harder to fake it. But a proof of reserve, the point I'm trying to make is not, is not an audit."

        "text": "One of the ways I think some people tried to say back months ago is that binance is not FTX is because binance did not have an equivalent of Alameda. Alameda was the sister trading fund of FTX, founded by sand Beckman Fried. There were always questions about how close the two companies actually were. Sam said that they were independent, but he was still the majority owner of Alameda. Obviously, those two companies were much more closely entwined than anyone had probably ever thought, and at least Binance didn't have that. But then again, we found evidence, I mean, we published it in March, Javier and I, about how they were sort of misappropriating, if that's the right term, tokens from wallets that were supposed to be used as collateral to MIT, more busd. And this was collateral for USDC, which meant that if all the outstanding, I guess, I think it was $1.8 million with USDC held by Binance, users tried to go and redeem it, they would not have been able to meet those redemptions, at least without bringing in other, other funds. That's a concern. The SEC allegations about customer funds moving into entities, other entities controlled by Binance that are not really disclosed. That's also a cause for concern. And one other thing I'd like to mention, too, when we were writing that report in March, we interviewed, there are then chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmet, who's one of the executives that resigned, I guess it was about a month or two ago, and asked him about some of these token flows. Because I mean, as you know, good journalistic practice is always to give someone your writing story about a chance to respond in case we make errors or they want to provide clarification, so on and so forth. And the answer that we got from him was really interesting to us in illustrative. He essentially said at the time that Binance was keeping two sets of buffs. One were the wallets themselves that people could watch, and then they also had their own internal ledger, and the two didnt always necessarily match up. And basically that we had to trust them, that they knew what assets were owed to who and for what. Obviously, that was concerning to hear. And then on top of it, it also repeats the whole sanctity of proof of reserves to the sense that there is one, because if what Patrick Hillman and again, hes not there anymore. But if what theyre saying is that we cant necessarily always go by whats in particular wallets, then whats the value of doing proof of reserve? So I think your question was, is this going to be an FTX? What is the evidence? Thats a very big allegation. And I mean, obviously, im not in a position to say that. And anyone who does is probably editorializing more than anything else. But we start seeing little pieces of information suggesting that binance is perhaps not being as scrupulous as they can be when it comes to accounting practices. And that's where things can kind of get into trouble."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Two easy questions. I mean, so binance us, obviously, the first thing on their mind is sort of trying to fight the SEC and figure out a way forward. They claim to have several years of Runway following these recent layoffs, and they're going to need it, because, at least based on the numbers that I sketched out for you earlier, the revenue is minuscule and it's going to be for the foreseeable future. But maybe that's okay. I mean, their new interim CEO, Norman Reed, if you look up his background, he worked at the DCCC. He worked at the SEC. Hes seen as a compliance regulatory honest guy. And maybe thats what finance us needs right now, to just stay afloat before it could try to catch the next bull run. If and when it comes, thats something to keep in mind for binance us. But again, at least according to latest numbers, I saw $20 million in daily volume, which is virtually nothing. And theyre going to have to find a way to grow that. But they also have to live to fight that next day. Related to binance again, its hard to tell. I mean, there is a world where binance can exist where its not quite as big as it was before. I mean, it happens in traditional industry all the time where somebody I wouldnt call binance having monopoly because obviously thats not true. But I mean, they dominate the market and maybe they become smaller. They're pulling back from several countries, recently pulled over Canada. They pulled back from Germany, they pulled back from Netherlands. I can mention many, many others. And maybe they pull back, retrench. They focus less on blitz scale, rolling out new products and just trying to service their core customers. And maybe that's how they existed. All the allegations surrounding them, we still hear about their great matching engine, their great performance, good customer service. I mean, those things can be true even if all the other stuff is true too, which I guess we'll have to wait for more reporting and potentially legal cases to play out. But then there's also a world, I guess, where if some of the worst fears come to fruition, where binance could end up imploding. And obviously that would reverberate around the crypto ecosystem as well. We just have to really wait and see. But I think the most important thing maybe to leave you and your listeners with is that I still think that crypto survived the collapse of FDX. It survived the collapse of blockfi and three arrows and celsius, and I can mention several others. It would also survive the collapse of binance if that's actually what ends up happening. But again, um, that's probably a step too far at this point, so we'll just have to keep watching."

        "text": "Hello, and thanks for tuning in to this week's unchained weekly news recap. I'm Michael del Castillo, a Knight baget fellow at Columbia University. In the latest of a series of developing events, the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which filed for bankruptcy last November following alleged criminal mismanagement, is navigating through significant legal and financial turmoil. The exchange received approval from us bankruptcy judge John Dorsey in the District of Delaware to sell $3.4 billion in crypto assets, including substantial holdings in bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, to repay creditors and recover from a $7 billion deficit. In what appears to be a move to prevent spooking the market, the sale, managed by Galaxy Digital, plans to liquidate up to $100 million worth of tokens, a figure that could potentially increase to $200 million, according to the plan. Simultaneously, Bahamas based FTX initiated legal action against cross chain protocols layer zero labs, seeking to recover over $21 million in what its lawyers called avoidable transfers that occurred in the 90 days leading up to its bankruptcy declaration. A lawsuit alleges fraudulent agreements and share transfers orchestrated between FTX subsidiary Alameda Researchs, then CEO Caroline Ellison, and Layer Zero. The exchange accuses Layer Zero, its former chief operating office, Sir Robert Leighton, and others from attempting to circumvent chapter eleven regulations and transfer substantial amounts of various tokens from Alameda to layer zeros control. Also this week, a court filing covered by the bloc disclosed FTX's substantial marketing and sponsorship payments to notable figures and organizations, including none other than NBA hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, Major League Baseball hall of Famer David Ortiz, tennis star Naomi Osaka, and NFL quarterback Trevor Lawrence, among others. As a monumental trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman, Fried rapidly approaches his defense submitted a series of probing questions to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to gauge jurors opinions on cryptocurrency, their body language, and perhaps in a hat tip to Bankman Fried's advocacy for the concept of selecting funding recipients based on data so called effective altruism. Meanwhile, Bankman Fried's defense alleged inaccuracies in the Department of Justice's claims regarding their clients laptop access during his incarceration. The legal team emphasized that he had poor Internet access connection during the time period he was allowed to use a laptop, hindering his ability to prepare adequately for the trial. This comes amid accusations by the DOJ of witness tampering that have seen Bankman Freed denied bail, with Judge Lewis Kaplan noting that the time pressure the defendant claims is largely of his own making. That's a particularly harsh stance since Bankman Freed faces myriad charges, including fraud, with potential imprisonment exceeding 100 years, and is slated to stand trial in less than a month on October 3. As for Bankman Freed, his defense team accused the DOJ of attempting to obstruct a fair trial by seeking to exclude proposed expert witnesses. The US securities and Exchange Commission has clamped down on the Stoner Cats NFT project, promoted by notable figures, including Mila Kunis and her famous husband, Ashton Kutcher. The project, which raised $8 million through the sale of 10,000 nfts to finance an automated series, has been charged with offering unregistered securities. Gribbier Grewal, the director of the SECS Division of Enforcement, emphasize that the economic reality of an offering, not its label, determines its classification as a security. Orchestrated by Stoner Cats two LLC, the project utilized a potent marketing strategy highlighting the creators Hollywood credentials and potential high resale values. It worked, to put it mildly, with the collection selling out in just 35 minutes and accumulating over $20 million in secondary sales. Despite not admitting to any wrongdoing, SC two has consented to a cease and desist order and agreed to pay a $1 million penalty, according to the SEC statement, which did not name the founders. Furthermore, the company pledged to establish a fund to reimburse impacted investors and to burn all stoner cat nfts in his possession, according to the statement, crypto lawyer Mike Selig wrote in a social media post, quote, the SEC is looking for PFP offerings as akin to 2017 vintage icos. Same marketing mistakes can be deadly this case marks yet another instance of the SECs stringent oversight of celebrity endorsed crypto ventures, such as the one backed by Kim Kardashian, who has fined $1 million for her role. Still, some are noting the irony that the SEC catches celebrities but misses the big blowups like FTX Massari, founder and my former boss at Coindesk Ryan Selkus wrote on social media. Your tax dollars at work. Connecticut Pace Digital currency group, otherwise known as DCG, the parent company behind the beleaguered lender Genesis Global, has put forth a proposal that could see users of Tyler and Cameron Winkle Voss Gemini earned program reclaiming between 95% and 110% of their assets. Whatever the amount ends up being, this initiative, filed on Wednesday, promises a significant recovery rate. The recovery strategy, however, hinges on the sale of 30 million shares of the grayscale bitcoin trust, valued at approximately $670 million, pledged as collateral by Genesis two Gemini. Gemini previously said it would help make its users whole up to $100 million if they weren't paid out in their entirety. The proposal comes amid a backdrop of legal disputes and regulatory scrutiny, with both Genesis and Gemini facing accusations from the SEC of selling unregistered securities. Despite the ongoing challenges, this proposal pending approval, does in fact offer a glimmer of hope to affected investors. In the latest developments surrounding the beleaguered Celsius network, former CEO Alex Masinski is embroiled in a series of legal battles following the freezing of his assets, including multiple bank accounts and a home, as ordered by the US Department of Justice. Moscinski is now fighting back against a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Moshinskis legal team argued that the FTC has failed to substantiate any violations of laws or rules by him, emphasizing that the commission is not entitled to monetary relief. Interesting to see how that one plays out. This move comes after Mashinsky faced severe charges, including securities fraud and wire fraud, leading to his arrest in July. In related news, Ronnie Cohen Pavone Celsius ex chief revenue officer, pled guilty to several criminal offenses in the US, according to a report from Reuters. This verdict comes after accusations of engaging in fraudulent activities, including market manipulation and securities fraud, primarily concerning the inflation of Celsius crypto token prices. Cohen Pavone, who reportedly profited immensely from his scheme, now faces up to 65 years in jail. Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Coin X is believed to have been attacked by north korean hacker group Lazarus, according to blockchain security researchers slowmist and Zack XBT initial estimates suggested losses of around $27 million, with later evaluations increasing the estimate to over $55 million drained from the exchanges hot wallets. The Hong Kong based exchange assured users that their assets are secure and promised full compensation for the affected parties. The exchange has temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals to ensure security measures and its actively investigating the incident, promising a detailed report soon. The controversial m'lady NFT collection, simultaneously known for its popular anime picture profiles and for its creator resigning after admitting to racist writings, encountered yet another setback this week after co creator Charlotte Fang confirmed in May that she pseudonymously wrote racist articles and resigned from her leadership position. She resurfaced on Monday, claiming on social media that an attacker had seized control of social media accounts associated with the project, including malady maker and remillionaire. In the social media post, Fang claimed an unnamed developer within the mulledy ecosystem had orchestrated a scheme diverting about $1 million in fees from the Remelia Corporation, the supposedly decentralized autonomous organization, or Dao, behind the Milady Maker project. This exploit primarily impacted the revenue generated from Bauckler, an experimental finance art project initiated in April 2023, according to Fang, who added that only Remilia's revenue from Bonkler was compromised. She further claimed that the main contract NFTs and Bancla reserves were still secure, going on to vow to pursue the culprits with the heavy hand of the law. In a startling era, crypto service provider Paxos has been identified as the entity that mistakenly paid a staggering 19.89 bitcoin, approximately $500,000 in transaction fees to transfer a mere zero zero eight bitcoin, or about $200. The incident, which occurred on Sunday, set a new record for the highest transaction fee paid in a single bitcoin transaction. A spokesperson from Paxos confirmed the mistake to the block, stating it was due to a bug in a single transfer, and sought to assure users that efforts are underway to recover funds from f two p from f two pool, the mining pool that processed the transaction. The spokesperson emphasized Paxos clients and end users have not been affected, and all customer funds are safe. However, an f two pool co founder has expressed annoyance and even regret about potentially agreeing to refund the amount, turning the matter over to a social media questionnaire. Results to be determined as of the time of this recording. For those of you looking for a funny way to end your week, the founder of Crypto Exchange, Thodex was sentenced to over 11,000 years in prison. Not that that's a laughing matter, but take a listen to what standup comedian Ginny Hogan has to say about the matter."

        "text": "FedEx was one of Turkey's largest crypto exchanges until it went offline in 2021, and its CEO, Farouk Fatih Ozer, went missing. About a year later, he was arrested in Albania, meaning that Andrew Tate is no longer Albania's most recent celebrity stowaway. Truly, though, Albania feels like the wet version of Burning man. After that, Ozer was extradited to Turkey, where just this week he was sentenced to a 11,000 years in prison. 11,000 is enormous. That's like the number of women SBF has slept with times 11,000. He also faces a fine of $5 million. So I guess once he gets out of prison in 11,000 years, he's gonna have to get a job. Before this, Ozer was already in jail for failure to submit his tax documents. I had no idea you could go to jail for that. In America, that just means you have to serve as an elected official. Two siblings have also been sentenced to jail, which I think is very good. This way, his parents can never be like, ugh, why can't you be good like your older sister? In America, we also dole out tough punishments for our crypto fraudsters. SPF has been charged with a similarly tough sentence, no access to almond butter."
