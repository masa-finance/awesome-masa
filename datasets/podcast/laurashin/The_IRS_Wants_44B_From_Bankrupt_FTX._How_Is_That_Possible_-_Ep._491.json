        "text": "Late Wednesday, Coindesk reported that the IR's is claiming $44 billion in taxes on FTX and Alameda, both of which are in bankruptcy. I see people commenting on how can that be when Alameda may never have made that much money. How do you think the IR's is coming up with these numbers?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, I mean, obviously it sounds like they don't actually have the details to figure out what the number actually is, so they just go for as high a number as possible. So there's been a lot of experts in the space. I'm not a tax expert, but I. I've been saying that meet TC has an incredibly bold summary of what's going on and why the IR's is saying all these things. But the view, which is what is explained, is that the IR's is basically reclassifying some contractor arrangements and employee arrangements and sort of claiming back taxes on that. And essentially, because they don't have the details, they just go for as high a number as possible, and then we probably expect the number to actually come down quite significantly, um, if and when it actually gets paid."

        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's the annoying bit. So, under the us bankruptcy code, the amounts of money is owed to Uncle Sam take priority over the average unsecured creditor, which, you know, unless you. Unless the sort of more creative trust arguments hold a bad fruit, that's what the average customer is, an unsecured creditor. So what you potentially have is you have these tax claims coming in in priority to unsecured claims. Just to clarify a bit further, because people have been asking, how does this affect FTX international depositors, given the large tax bill is hitting Alameda? So to sort of recap, FTX is an unsecured creditor of Alameda. So that's what happens when Sam takes all of our money out into Alameda and uses it to invest in stuff. What actually has happened is that he's borrowed that money from FTX International, and in order for FTX International to recover that money, they recover in the capacity of unsecured creditor having, let's just say if it's a $20 billion tax liability show up at the Alameda level, it means that the tax man gets paid before any money goes back into FTX International, where it can then be used to pay, well, us."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, a liquidated claim is basically a claim for a agreed amount of damages, if that makes sense. So when you have liquidated damages clause, it means you've agreed that if there is a breach, this would be the amount of liquid of damages payable. Unliquidated just means. Well, they're just not liquidated."
    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay. Meaning that there's a dollar amount, but that hasn't been agreed upon."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, so you started to talk about kind of like the order of preference when we were talking about the admin priority. But obviously, some of these tax claims are not just against Alameda, but also FTX. So in general, now, when you. Because obviously, if so, like when you look at the docket, you'll see there's like, many, many, many different IR's claims against all these different entities in the FTX Alameda empire. So in general, now, how does this affect the bankruptcy proceeding?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, you're basically applying the admin priority rule to each individual entity, right? So let's say I noticed there's a tax claim against FTX International as well. So that's the kind of the, that's the straightforward, in a way, straightforward one. Right. So FTX International, you've got your customer deposits in there. All of your customers are claiming, I'm assuming at this point, as unsecured creditors, there is a tax claim from the IR's on top of it. It means the IR's needs to get paid its money first before any of the customers can take their money out. Now, you apply that across the board to all these entities. And so, for instance, like I explained above, Alameda earlier, Alameda owes FTX International $10 billion. If Alameda sells its assets and manages to get $10 billion and moves it and uses it to pay FTX International, FTX International then, now has that money, which can use to pay its own unsecured creditors, that is, asset depositors. Now, if there is a $20 billion tax claim sitting in Alameda, which ranks ahead of FTX International's claim against Alameda, what happens is your $10 billion that you may have gotten from liquidating whatever random Sam coin shitcoinst investments, now that all just goes to the tax man. So no money comes into FTX International, and that means no money is there to pay down the customers."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So, as we alluded to earlier, the way that these numbers are being presented in the bankruptcy is not with some kind of, I guess, what's the word? Proof of how they were arrived at. And I saw some tax analysts calling into question how it was that the IR's came up with these calculations. So meet TC, who you mentioned. His profile says he's a principal at Degen legal, and he tweeted about the $20 billion tax bill on Alameda and said, quote, in part, it appears the IR's went back and reclassified all employees from contractors to employees and hit them for unpaid employer side employment taxes. So for people who don't know this, when you are an employee, then your employer will pay a 15% tax on your income and then you also pay taxes. If you're like self employed, you are responsible for both sides of that. Another tax related person, it seems Mister Purple DJ tweeted, quote, the IR's claims $8 billion in same tax for 2022, which would exceed all revenue. He also says that it claims $122 million per quarter for payroll taxes, which are 15%. And he said that would imply that they had $3.2 billion in salaries. And then he also flagged that the IR's is not claiming any interest or penalties. And he said, typically that's where you usually see large amounts of. So it looks, you know, like people are kind of skeptical of how it was that the IR's arrived at these numbers. So is there any point at which the IR's will have to show its calculations in the bankruptcy?"

        "speaker": "B",

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Presumably at some point that they're going to have to, you know, I think this will certainly be defended and litigated. Like, John Ray is not going to sit there and just hand over money to the IR's. This is something that's going to be an ongoing matter and it's something that will be determined further down the line for a amount that is going to be vastly smaller than the $20 billion. Even if it's a billion dollars, it's painful. Even if it's $500 million, it's painful because of the administrative priority."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Right. But I guess what I'm asking is. So, so it seems like you think John Ray is. He's not going to just accept these, he's going to. Absolutely."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, what the IR's put in is a claim, right? It's just that it's a claim, and anyone can go in and put in a claim against the FTX estate at this point of time. The question is whether or not that claim actually well exists. And the quantum of that claim, that is something that needs to be worked out and flashed out over the coming weeks and months. And presumably the estate is going to start doing a lot of homework to figure out. Look, even if we reclassify of our contract agreements, employment agreements, this is the maximum amount of tax will be payable, and it will be paid out of this silo and this silo as opposed to that silo. So, yeah, I fully expect a lot of work going to be done. The Sullivan Cromwell is definitely calling up the tax department and putting them on, you know, making them work late tonight."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Oh boy, I'm going to need way more than 15 minutes, probably like an hour or 2 hours, maybe five. It short the argument that arose a very long time ago. I think we may have discussed this briefly around how the FTX terms of services worked, where customers who put in digital assets retain title to those digital assets. The trust argument is simply that those digital assets that customers put in were always held on trust by FTX International, and when they transfer them to Alameda, the customers continue to have a proprietary interest in those assets assets. So if you have a proprietary interest in those assets, you are not an unsecured creditor. You aren't a creditor at all. You're just taking assets that you also asserting the proprietary interest that you have in those assets. The reason why I said it's going to take a very long time to flash out in detail is because it isn't the silver bullet, which a lot of people seem to think it is. People seem to think, hey, if the trust argument works, that means that my bitcoin, which is sitting on FTX, is my bitcoin. So FTX has to give it to me in full without, you know, effectively in priority to everything else. Thing is, it really isn't that simple because it has massive, massive knock on effects. For instance, you can no longer have your preference claims, right? Your preference, your withdrawal, period. Because I didn't withdraw any money. I'm not a creditor. I just took assets that belong to me. So you're not, you're no longer using that preference section of US bankruptcy code to start clawing back assets against other customers. You're using something else completely different, potentially something founded in unjust enrichment, which, again, is going to take us a very, very long time to talk about."
    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "If it's thought that those assets simply belong to the customers and they are not unsecured creditors, then, like, basically, the notion of clawbacks almost doesn't exist anymore, at least for customers, not in."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Not in accordance with the US bankruptcy code. Because now what happens if you essentially think of everything as, if you think of the substantially of the customary funds as being on trust, as opposed to customers being unsecured creditors of the company, then you aren't looking at bankruptcy law anymore. You're looking at trust law. You're looking at a trust shortfall, clearly. And someone who's withdrawn has withdrawn in priority to others and therefore not taken their pro rata share of that shortfall, and you're basically back to trust law, common law. It's going to be incredibly, incredibly complicated, almost. To add to that, digital assets. If the trust argument does bear fruit, it's basically going to pick winners and losers. It's going to pick, there's going to be customers who wired $10 million or $100 million to Alameda or FTX. Well, they wired to Alameda because FTX used Alameda's bank account. But there's going to be customers that wired fiat money, and there's going to be a customer that wire that same amount and send the same amount in USDC. And the guy who sends it in, USDC gets all of his money back, whereas the guy who wires the money via bank trust against zero or close to nothing. So it's going to end up in a pretty crazy situation. You're going to have a situation where there's going to be a lot of litigation around what assets are in trust, what assets are not in trust. If you started using the leveraged trading functions of FTX, do you then give up a proprietary claim? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that."

So. But what if you were wiring money because you thought that you were buying a whole bitcoin, like you wired to, you know, $20,000, because you thought you were getting one whole bitcoin?"

Then the guy who deposits the bitcoin, does he no longer have a proprietary interest in the, quote unquote trust? Does he now only have a, you know, claim as unsecured credit against the FTX estate? You see why this creates a lot of."

        "speaker": "A",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's that as well, of course. So you are looking into very, very complex areas of trust law, and, look, I can't say that I have all the answers right on. There is literally no one here who can say that they have all the answers right now. If we were to end up in a world where customer assets were held on trust."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, and before we. I still want to get to the leverage question, but before we move to that, I just wanted to ask, like, it sounds like all of this is raising the exact same issues that came up with the Mount Gox case, but at that time, the japanese court decided to denominate everything in dollars and not return investments to people based on the amount of bitcoin they had. So is this kind of like a question that keeps coming up and over and over again in different courts worldwide? And do you think that we're just going to end up with different jurisdictions that have different standards, or do you feel like we'll start to see a particular standard emerge?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So, I mean, I spoke with Gondi about this Mount Gox thing as well. And I think what happened, I mean, there was some sort of arrangement that happened where I think the creditors are in fact getting the bitcoin back because the value of bitcoin has gone up so massively that I can't recall the exact details of the arrangement of the process they use. But it's very different from the, from the us court system. The issue of denominational crypto claims is going to be something that will be, that is going to be an issue. It is likely going to be litigated. It is an issue that it doesnt really have to be determined unless you actually liquidate, you completely liquidate the company because you could agree as part of a chapter eleven plan or agree as part of the restructuring plan how you are going to deal with those assets. You could. The one where I can see this being litigated very seriously is three arrows capital, because that's a liquidation scenario where there's a lot of finality to it."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Because it's a liquidation scenario where we're looking at chapter eleven. Chapter eleven is a reorganization procedure for the most part. Right. I mean, we could still end up having to liquidate bits and pieces of it. I mean, the customer claims may end up just being denominated in us dollars."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "That Celsius is custody, correct. Basically the custody lawsuits in Celsius, whereas people would say buy assets are in custody. The thing is, Celsius actually had a custody function and a non custody function where it was very clear that those in the non custody function were not secured creditors. And then there was a custody function and then there was a withhold function somewhere where I think that was where a lot of litigation was. Now in FTX, the argument is that even though Ftx never really had a custody function or anything like that, they are arguing that from the terms of service, the Ftx never had title to any of those assets and therefore FTX using those assets, lending them to Alameda when they did so, it was an appropriation of custom assets and there was a trust over those assets."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, probably, except its also complicated. In fact, its been a while since I revisited this, but ive had quite long discussions with Gandhi about this. And it doesnt help that the terms of service were changed semi recently to the english terms of service, which kind of provides this. Your title does not transfer provision, which everyone is hanging their heads on. So potentially you then have a timing issue as well as to which terms of service your specific deposit came out under."
    },

        "speaker": "A",

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "No. So the terms of service that everyone is referencing in order to make this trust argument is a terms of service governed under english law, which specifically states that your digital assets remain yours and title does not transfer to FTX. And this is the provision which people use to say, the digital assets belong to me. They're held on trust. I have the right proprietary interest in these digital assets. The slightly complicating bit is that these terms of service were fairly recent. There were previous versions of it which may not have language that put it in such a specific manner. And from recollection they were also not english law governed."

What's the nature of the security on those digital assets? Do you give up your proprietary title when you use any leverage functions? Maybe, maybe not, depending on what the security ends up actually being. Obviously, it's not specified. And to what extent do you give it up if you do? No idea. Absolutely no idea. There's a lot of open questions with the trust stuff. That's what I'm saying. It's not a silver bullet where trust finding means I get all my money back and everyone else gets fucked."

I think a lot of people do because that may, that may or may not give them better recoveries. But what's happening is this is all going to be litigated on the FTX customer dime. Right.

I think I mentioned previously, FTX was basically trying to do what your Voyager Celsius did, except Voyager and Celsius at terms and conditions that allowed them to use and re hypothecate customer assets or FTX did not.

SPF seeks dismissal of charges blaming crypto winter Sam Benkman Fried, the founder of the bankrupt crypto exchange, has intensified his legal fight, petitioning a Manhattan federal judge to dismiss the majority of criminal charges against him related to the exchanges collapse. Bankman Frieds legal counsel argued on Monday that several accusations, including fraud, conspiracy, campaign finance law violations and money laundering, do not adequately constitute an offense. The move seeks to nullify ten of the 13 charges against the FTX founder, leaving only allegations of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. The attorneys further claimed that the us government's original indictment was a quote of classic rush to judgment amid a turbulent crypto market that saw multiple bankruptcies. They also asserted that the team handling FTX's bankruptcy proceedings, led by the current CEO, John Ray III, has been co opted by the prosecutors to help gather evidence. The dismissal request will be heard by US District Judge Louis Kaplan on June 15. Meanwhile, Banquet Freed's former associates, including ex Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellisone and FTX co founder Gary Wang, have pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges and are cooperating with the ongoing investigation. Bittrex bites the bankruptcy bullet amidst SEc pressure Bittrex, the Seattle based crypto exchange, filed for a chapter eleven bankruptcy this week following the company's decision to shutter its us operations amidst ongoing legal challenges by the securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator accused the company of operating an unregistered securities exchange, though Bittrex has denied the allegations, stating, quote, securities were not offered or traded on Bittrex. The company says us customers funds remain secure and that repayment is a priority. Bittrex's attorney, Sushil Kirpalani, stated that the company had sufficient crypto holdings to fully repay all remaining customers, a fact underscored by the approval of a unique bankruptcy loan. The Delaware bankruptcy court permitted Bittrex to borrow $7 million in bitcoin from its parent company, Aquila Holdings. Bittrex's chapter eleven filing does not affect its international operations under Bittrex Global, which continues to service customers outside the US. Nevertheless, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is listed as the company's largest unsecured creditor, with a debt exceeding $24 million tied to a settlement over alleged sanctions violations. The SEC also features among the creditors with a claim amount yet to be determined pending ongoing litigation. Regulatory scrutiny triggers strategic retreat for major crypto market makers this week, Bloomberg reported that increased regulatory pressure on digital asset trading in the US has prompted renowned market makers Jane street group and jump crypto to scale back their crypto operations. On Tuesday, bitcoin began trading at a premium on binance US, a phenomenon that industry experts suggest could be linked to these drops in market making. Industry analysts are also raising red flags regarding the potential impact of this strategic retreat on bitcoin trading. Liquidity traditionally, market makers like Jane street and Jump crypto have provided stability and depth to the crypto markets. Their reduced involvement could exacerbate existing liquidity challenges, particularly in the bitcoin market. Bitcoins network congestion triggers withdrawal halt and BRC 20 reconsideration in the wake of substantial bitcoin network congestion, binance, the worlds largest crypto exchange, temporarily suspended bitcoin withdrawals. This move followed an influx of over $180 million and a surge in unconfirmed bitcoin transactions, reaching a record of 488,000. Critics like Swan bitcoin analyst Sam Callahanhe argued that Binance either quote either quote didn't want to pay up with higher fees or didn't want more bitcoin leaving the exchange. The rising transaction fees, now up 300% from last year, are due to the proliferation of BRC 20 transactions on the bitcoin ordinals protocol. These transactions account for over half the bitcoin network's activities and have led to calls from bitcoin core developers to potentially reject all BRC 20 token transfers. One developer, Ali Sharif, proposed a code based change to address this issue or the introduction of a runtime option to delete all non standard taproot transactions, including BRC 20. Adding to the networks challenges. The ordinals system, utilized for inscribing digital collectibles onto the bitcoin blockchain, recently encountered a bug that disrupted its numbering system. Ordinals creator Casey Rottermore admitted to uncertainties about the best course of action for addressing the bug. Aragon association curtails ant voting rights a week after booting several members who questioned leadership from its Discord channel, the Aragon association has decided to repurpose its decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. The association has now transitioned its focus toward a new grants program aimed at developers of decentralized applications and other DAO creators. Louis Cuende, a co founder, also called for $30 million in token buybacks. These moves come in response to the activities of the risk free value, or RFV raiders, a group of activist investors whose members include Arca Capital Management and which has become active in daos whose treasuries are larger than the market caps of their coins. The association considered their activities to be potential, quote, financial attacks. Critics have questioned the Aragon association's motives and the lack of a community vote on these decisions. Arca, for instance, has called for more transparency and community empowerment. The association maintains that the repurposing of the DAO is a necessary step for the project security and advancement of its mission. Digital currency group wrestles with Genesis bankruptcy Tuesday was the due date for DCG's first loan repayments to its insolvent lending subsidiary, Genesis Capital.

DCG and Genesis are currently engaged in a 30 day mediation period with stakeholders following several creditors abandoning a previous agreement.

Grayscale targets expansion with new ETF proposals Grayscale Investments, the world's largest digital asset manager, announced plans to launch three new exchange traded funds and create a new entity, the Grayscale Funds Trust. The firm's CEO, Michael Sonnenschein, highlighted the company's aim to continue creating and managing quote regulated future forward products. The new ETF's include one Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust, which would mimic bitcoin futures ETF's unless, because of the uncertain status of ether, the SEC rejects it two grayscale global bitcoin composite ETF, which will invest 40% in internationally listed bitcoin ETF's and 60% in bitcoin mining companies and three the Grayscale privacy etfemen, which will invest 10% in Grayscale's zcash trust and other privacy related companies. BlockFi clients to be reimbursed $300 million blockfi, one of the many crypto lending platforms that went bust last year, has been ordered by a bankruptcy judge to refund nearly $300 million to its customers. The ruling, issued by Judge Michael Kaplan, determined that assets in Blockfi's custodial wallets are considered client property net assets of the bankruptcy estate. However, a further $375 million that clients attempted to withdraw from Blockfly's interest bearing accounts after November 10, 2022, remains in contention. Kaplan stated that these transactions, initiated after the company froze funds due to the fallout of FTX's collapse, were not completed. While these funds can technically be returned immediately under bankruptcy law, a dispute over their status has delayed the reimbursement process. Voyager Digital moves forward with a self liquidation plan crypto lender Voyager Digital is charting its path toward dissolution and asset liquidation after unsuccessful negotiations with both FTX US and Binance US. The termination of a $1 billion asset purchase agreement with Binance us after the company abruptly pulled out has left Voyager in a predicament. The consequent liquidation will enable Voyager's creditors to recoup approximately 36% of their crypto assets, a considerable decrease from the previously projected 72% to 73% recovery rate under the aborted acquisition plans. With a focus on making amends, Voyager has declared that initial distributions of cash and crypto to its customers are expected to commence in the upcoming weeks. Ex Coinbase manager is sentenced to prison Ishan Wahi, previously a product manager for Coinbase, has been handed a two year prison sentence in Crypto's second insider trading case. While he admitted guilt to two conspiracy accounts involving wire fraud, Wahe shared private company data about upcoming asset listings on Coinbase with his brother Nikhil and a friend, Samir Rahmani. This insider knowledge allowed the trio to make informed trades ahead of listing announcements, netting them $1.5 million across 55 digital assets.

Suzhou gets Singapore court to muzzle Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes, the co founder of Bitmex, has been issued a singaporean court restraining order at the request of Su Xiu, co founder of now defunct crypto hedge fund three Arrows Capital. Hayes is prohibited from using any language or communication that could distress Xu. This order follows Hayes persistent tweets demanding $6 million he alleges to be owed since three acs collapse. Some crypto community members had harsh words for zhou. Mike Dudas of 6th man Ventures tweeted, Suzhou is a coward to the core who betrayed his friends investors in his fund, raiding the remaining three AC funds under false pretenses before going on the lam and ghosting those he grifted from beyond. Disgraceful to see him trying to play the victim. Time for fun. Bits Unchained's Jenny Hogan has something to say about Binance needing to temporarily halt bitcoin withdrawals."

        "text": "It's allergy season, and Binance is congested. That's right. They paused bitcoin withdrawals twice on their platform in the last 24 hours. Withdrawals are back now, but bitcoin prices have fallen 3.5%, which, honestly does seem like a normal weekend. But we should still be mad at Binance. People can't just have their bitcoin withdrawals halted. Okay, what if they need that bitcoin to pay rent? Said dozens of bitcoin traders who live rent free in their parents basements. Binance is calling this issue a learning opportunity. That's not what a learning opportunity is. A learning opportunity is when I hire an unlicensed plumber because he's cheaper and he ends up creating an issue that floods my downstairs neighbor's apartment and I get charged dollar 700. Binance apologized and thanked users for their patience. I mean, duh, nothing screams patience like a crypto trader. They also adjusted their fees to deal with this in the future. The only issue is they adjusted them upwards. Please accept our sincerest apologies and also higher prices."
