        "text": "Apparently. So I always say it's been a crazy week in crypto and it's just never not been true. I don't know what it is, but this year has just been an avalanche of crazy, crazy things going on. And so the first thing that just dropped a couple of days ago was the CFTC lawsuit against Binance. So this is the big one. This is the thing that everybody's been waiting for for a very, very long time. Binance, although they've had lots of little kind of pot shots at them by individual regulators in individual countries. Nobody's ever actually tried to go after the king. And that's basically what the CFTC did in this lawsuit. They instead of saying, oh, you're operating without a license or you're doing this, oh, you're kind of like skirting some of the rules, they're like no, no, no. Your entire business is skirting all of the rules everywhere. And it all is going straight at not only Binance, the company, not just binance.com comma, but also cz himself. So the complaint is 70 plus pages long. It's a lot. I actually read through the whole thing and I'm going to give for the audience some of the highlights to understand what the case is that the CFTC is laying out. So the broad shape of the case is basically that, unsurprisingly that theyre offering financial derivatives and commodities products to us customers without having a license. So thats the basic obvious thing the CFTC is responsible for that binance is not doing. Now heres some of the interesting details that we learned from this very, very extensive complaint. Theres a lot of information in here that is surprising, how much data they have and how many chat logs they have from inside of binance. The first thing is the chief compliance officer, Samuel Lim. This guy, we have so many of the chat logs from this guy. He's sort of painted as this iago like figure, this sort of Gremlin who's just like hahaha, we're evading compliance and it's okay. So internally they knew that they had a huge portion of their user base from the US, which of course they should not have because they're not licensed in the US to offer derivatives to us customers. And so when Bitmex was taken down in 2019, they decided to change the way that they reported and labeled their us customers as unknown on their US on their internal analytics. So CZ and everybody internally knew that they had a huge amount of us customer base, but they instructed their customers to use VPN's and they had this article that they listed of here's how to use a VPN. If websites don't allow you to log in from the US, you can use a VPN. Wink wink. I don't know if you might have this problem. So they started ip blocking."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "There was a really good tidbit in there where they claimed to be IP blocking and you get a pop up if you're using from the US and you could just x out the pop up and then keep using the site. So they weren't actually IP blocking."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "What the CFTC complaint paints is that binance was always kind of wink wink doing compliance stuff where basically they were like, oh, we're kind of blocking the US. But if a us client comes to us and like, hey, we're now getting blocked, they would basically advise them to say, hey, just use a fucking VPN. Once they use a VPN, they'd be like, okay, great, this is the same customer. Let's continue letting them use their own same account, continue with their vip points and their reputation and their trading limits and all that stuff. So not only were they allowing lots and lots of uS customers to use the platform, at one point they had something on the order of 20% of their volume was from the US until they onboarded binance us. In which case once they had Binance us, they pushed the customers from the US to Binance uS. Unless they were doing a lot of volume. If they were doing a lot of volume, then they would advise them to say, hey, you guys get to level up from Binance us. Binance us is the kiddie pool. We're going to bring you on to binance.com dot. In order to do that, you will need to have some kind of offshore account. And so they would basically nudge, nudge, advise them into, hey, set up an offshore account. We won't look through to the beneficial owners or we'll do some kind of magic or will allow you to transfer your KYC, if your KYC doesn't work, to basically massage this as best we can to get you on to binance.com comma, where the real money is made and where the most, you know, lucrative products are also, are also going to be tradable. Now, not only were they allowing lots and lots of us customers to trade on binance, but also they were basically, their entire KYC program was kind of a sham. So for one, they knew that they were allowing a lot of black market activity on the platform to the point where there are references to Hamas as being a customer of binance. And so this is in direct violation of sanctions, knowing violations of sanctions. There were a lot of examples of darknet markets, basically people engaged in strictly illegal activity, a bunch of russian mobsters or something like that that were using the platform. And they were basically like, yeah, this is almost certainly illegal activity. Let's just all agree to look the other way. They have chat logs where they basically acknowledge that, hey, we know that this is illegal activity. Let's just, let's just kind of look."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "The other way these chat logs are like reminiscent of the FX chat logs from the financial crisis, if you remember all of those. Very funny, but like almost so comical that someone actually wrote that level of chat log. So I highly recommend if you're a listener and you haven't read some of these, you should read them not only for the legal understanding, but also for entertainment purposes because it's definitely worth reading for that reason."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, if you just scan through for like the different spacing on the chat logs, I think it's. If you're not going to read the whole thing, just read the chat logs because you'll get a sense very quickly of how bad this is. The other element of this is that there is basically 300 accounts that were internally used by binance and CZ to trade directly on binance itself. So there was also indications that big prop shops were given special latency fast lanes. So same thing that has happened with FTX is that certain people were getting faster API access than others. And the other thing was that all this activity was obviously willful. They were denying all this stuff publicly and they were doing this over and over and over again in all of their public statements. And internally everything was rolling up to CZ. CZ was basically making all these decisions directly about the compliance program, about the strategy with the US, about, you know, all the shell companies that they used. And everything was happening over signal with auto deleting messages. And so it was intentionally designed so that nothing was going to leave a trace. There were a couple of choice quotes that I thought were very interesting that I wanted to share directly. One other thing I should mention before I go into the quotes, the CFTC directly, ironically in this complaint, they claimed that ether, bitcoin, litecoin, USDT and Busu were all commodities, sort of in direct contradiction to the SEC with what the SEC just claimed like a week ago. And the other interesting thing is that in order to establish jurisdiction, so they made a bunch of claims to establish jurisdiction, obviously, one of them just being that there were a ton of us customers on the platform, so it's not a hard place to establish jurisdiction. But one of the added points they made was that they used us services for binance, such as AWS and Google, which basically means that the whole world is us jurisdiction now. Because, I don't know, almost every company has something that depends on AWS or Google. The two quotes that I thought were fantastic, the first one was talking about Lim, the CCO. They claim Lim displayed a nuanced understanding of applicable regulatory requirements and the potential liability that may accompany a failure to comply with us law. For example, he chatted to a colleague in October 2020, us users equals CFTC civil case can pay a fine. Go settle. No kyc equals bsa. The Bank Secrecy act equals criminal case have to go to jail. Interestingly, a lot of what they've detailed here in this complaint is not just civil, it's not just CFTC stuff. All this stuff is about sanctions violations, is about intentionally facilitating money laundering. Lots of stuff that looks a lot like the latter part of this statement, which is BSA act criminal case have to go to jail. And so a lot of people are now speculating that the CFTC lawsuit, this is so usually CFTC lawsuits don't look like this. There's not this much other stuff about potential criminal behavior that's going on here. And so a lot of people are speculating that there's going to be another drop fairly soon, whether it be from the SEC, whether it be from the DOJ. We know that the SEC and the DOJ have been investigating binance for years. And with all this data now out there from the CFTC, there's probably going to be some collaboration with some of the other us agencies that most likely, my guess would be that something criminal is coming, because this stuff very, very clearly rises to, you know, we have in this example alone, there's just clear sanctions violations which are strict criminal liability. And then lastly, the last really interesting thing, the question when you read this thing, you're like, how do they have all this? Surely Binance did not give this to them when they asked them for documents, and the CFTC explicitly states particular things they asked for that Binance refused to provide them. In one of the statements, somewhere in there it says, CZ communicate over signal with the auto delete functionality enabled with numerous binance officers, employees and agents. For example, the following signal, text chains or group chats collected from CZ's telephone were among those set to auto delete, implying that maybe the CFTC may have leaked unintentionally in this passage that they had access to CZ's phone. So I'm gonna stop there. What are you guys reaction to seeing the CFTC lawsuit?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I mean, that was actually the first thing I wanna point out is like, everyone needs to come up with some conspiracy theory for why how the CFTC obtained those. They were a little imprecise in their language in other places too. So I could totally imagine that it's actually like someone else who is a whistleblower was in the same chat and it was on auto delete mode. And, you know, the CFTC is not exactly being quite precise about where they got it from. Like, they know that if the group chat was on auto delete, it must have been deleted on CC's phone. But, like, they. It was a little bit duplicated."

    {
        "speaker": "C",

    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "I mean, there's a lot of different plausible explanations, assuming it wasn't, like, a grammatical error. So, one is that at some point, the investigation was friendlier. You know, he did say that they'd been talking to them for two years. It's possible he turned over from, like, a subpoena or something like that, his phone, voluntarily, at some point, either, like, an image of it or whatever. That's, you know, it's not likely, but it's a possibility is that he provided that information. The second was that, you know, it was accessed through unscrupulous means in one way or another. It's possible, you know, someone just imaged it, you know, walking past his computer or something like that. Who knows? But the third possibility in my mind is that I, you know, it is just a grammatical error, and it's not actually from his phone. It's implied to be from his phone, and they're just picking up other information they have and piecing it together to say, here's what we know about him."

        "text": "I just want to point out, I don't think this is a. NSA chose bad parameters for signal, and signal used a nist curve, and somehow they backdoored it. I feel like I've read some. I've read people online be like, oh, signals now broken, whatever. I just want to, like, the reason I was bringing up the conspiracy theories is I've seen things like that, and I would say I highly doubt that that's true."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I highly doubt they would reveal that fact through this lawsuit as well. Does not seem maybe like the best use. I mean, I agree. I think maybe it's multiple collaborators over multiple periods of time, or, like, is more like, you have a compromised client on a bad phone or bad computer versus something wrong with the protocol. So, yeah, I think that there's multiple angles of attack here, but I guess when I was reading this, I think the last big exchange lawsuit that was not fraud or collapse was Bitmex. And thinking about the similarities there, but also the differences being not so intentionally flouting BSA compliance, which it seems like finance was pretty actively doing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Yeah, Bitmex was just such a different scale. Bitmex was like, oh, you had some percent of us customers on there. It's like what the DOJ showed for Bitmex was that there was some Americans, they didn't even say how much. If I recall, it was like a very small number. This is like a multi year, very willful. It's not like, oh, you were negligent and you didn't implement a KYC program. It's that you basically, like, lied over many years about the extent to which you were doing this. And even, like, you know, like a year or two years ago, they were openly flouting this stuff. And it's also like with the DOJ, they never had anything on Arthur about terrorist financing or facilitating. Binance is operating at such a bigger scale than BitMex ever was as well. I think it's important for people to understand that binance, at the height of the market, Binance was probably worth 200, $300 billion. It was making so much money. It was so massive as a business, obviously. I mean, equity prices in general were much higher at the height of the market. But they just have such a huge footprint globally that it is basically one of the. It was basically one of the biggest companies in the world, and they were effectively open for business for almost anybody. That's what the complaint is effectively alleging. And that just means that the volume of criminal activity and black market behavior that's flowing through the platform now, obviously, a lot of it is too small, and it's not worth it, their time to bank it. But for some of this stuff, like, clearly the policy, you can see it from the interaction with Cz. Cz is like, look, as long as we don't get caught, and as long as we can sort of claim publicly that we're kind of paying lip service to compliance, do whatever, that's basically what almost every chat log with CZ looks like."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Well, let me push back on that statement just now. So, yes, there was a lot of stuff that was too small for them to care about it because it wouldn't be profitable. But, like, some of the logs that were presented were transactions that were too small, and they were talking about it, and it was extremely bad. The best example is, like, talking about how they were aware that Hamas was laundering $600 at a time through their platform, and they were joking like, oh, is that even enough to buy an AK 47? Like, haha. Like, that's the crazy thing to me, is that it is such a small amount of money that there's no way it was profitable for them as a business. And they still acknowledged it and moved forward with it over, like, a small dollar amount. It's not like this was like, billions of dollars. This was $600 of terrorist financing that they laughed about. So seems extremely illogical to me."

I think what happens to CZ here almost certainly is going to be really ugly. We already have enough in here for them to bring criminal charges, as far as I can tell. And the kind of criminal charges that you would bring to CZ are not like a, hey, slap on the wrist. Like, oh, you sort of. You didn't put a good enough compliance program in. The stuff here seems much bigger than that. Now, that being said, we know the DOJ has been investigating them for years, although it seems like, however, the CFTC got this information, whether it be from. Because so many of these conversations involve the CCO. My assumption is that if there is a cooperator, it's probably the CCO, because the CCO is probably."

Somebody's gonna come after you, somebody's gonna kill you, your lifespan is gonna be very limited, but there's really no way to be the king of the world without getting some blood on your hands. That seems to be, in some way, the moral of the story here. Like, the only way binance could grow this big and become this dominant is by cutting more corners than everybody else.

That's not cutting a corner. They could have built the hugest exchange of all time without having any accounts trading against their customers. They could have built probably the hugest of all time while being serious about blocking terrorist financing. Right? Like, none of those things, I think, helped them build the hugest exchange of all time."

First of all, the identity of merit point, which also ironic that the name of the trading on your own platform thing has the word merit in it. Like, kind of, like, unreal. That entity has been well known for a long time, and there've been a bunch of articles that have listed it, so it's definitely not. There's been like, CZ is only an investor in this trading firm that happens to be 20% of binance volumes. That sort of bit has been some of the older articles. So I'd say that was actually one of the least surprising things. The Hamas thing was the most surprising to me, for sure. I was like, whoa.

Highest ego people I've ever interacted with in algorithmic trading in my time. He thinks maybe so highly of himself that he didn't say no comment to the Wall Street Journal when he should have today. Because the article doc where he docks himself is kind of funny. So trading from a is radix, which is like, it's a really small trading firm. In 2018, before I started gauntlet, I was like, debating staying in algo trading. I interviewed a few places and everyone told me radix was going to die. So I was like, okay, well, not going to go talk to them. So I guess they must have survived off this binance thing. That was like, one interesting fact I learned about this was like a bunch of trading firms that were almost dead. In normal futures and equities, their path to survival was binance market making.

There's a bunch of stuff like that, which is actually, you can get a lot of penalties or you can get licenses suspended, so you can't trade CME, FCM type of things. I could see some blowback for the trading firms. I'm more curious what the us penalties are from the perspective of. I still believe that there's a ton of volume on Binance. That's american. It's not like, even with post KYC doing things like, yeah, making jersey entities. So I'm just more curious if any of them get prosecuted, I actually suspect that then you'll see a ton of us volume leave binance permanently because people will be like, we can't take this risk of our offshore entity not being good enough cover for us."

So I think it's like a billion out of like 60 billion plus in total deposits they have. So binance issued a statement, basically first rebutting a few of the claims. It was honestly not, it was not very substantive. They basically said, like, one, we have a big compliance program. We have like 70 plus people who are on compliance full time, which is. I don't know how that, what, you know, I don't know what that has to do with anything. Um, we work really hard on compliance. We have great. Kyc. We have a lot of licenses. Uh, and then they.

And so, you know, I have accounts on binance as well, because I get paid in crypto and I sometimes need to turn it into cash because I need to, you know, pay my rent. Um, so kind of, you know, very, like, uh, sympathetic slant to the way he's trying to portray the, um, the 300 and internal accounts that they use. And then I think the chief strategy officer of binance stated that on Twitter that the reason why they use these internal trading accounts was only to provide liquidity and to minimize slippage, not to actively hunt orders or try to adversarially attack some of the people on their exchange, as FTX was once accused of. So I don't know how much their response really addressed much of note in there. So I guess the question is, like, okay, what happens from here? Okay, let's assume. I think at this point, it seems pretty obvious that there's. This is not the end. It's not just going to be a CFTC complaint. There's going to be more that comes, whether it's the SEC, whether it's a DOJ. What do you think is the net result of this? Like, obviously, this stuff takes time to work out in the courts. Do you think that CZ is still going to be running binance in two years? Do you think Binance still going to be top dog in two years, three years, five years? What would you guys predict? Robert, you're up first. You're making a face, so you're up first."

You know, this is in the public's interest strategy. Like, shutting down Coinbase is not in the public's interest.

But if they somehow are able to not have that happen, then it'll be very different. So I guess because of that, I give a pretty wide confidence interval. I'm not sure it will totally shut down. Like, BitMex didn't totally shut down. Right? Like, I'm more of the mindset that it'll be crimped in some ways, and."

First of all, the first CEO of Binance us disappeared for a couple of years, although I think I saw her in Denver, so I think she's back in the world. The second CEO of Binance us, who was the former OCC head, left after three months, and then it's just been this kind of ring around the rosie type of management since then.

We also got a wells notice by the SEC issued against Coinbase. So for those of you who don't know, a well's notice is basically an indication of, like, hey, we're going to sue you. Give us a response in case that we decide not to sue you at the last minute. But probably we're going to sue you. So Coinbase issued a whale's notice. Coinbase did not share all the details of the well's notice, but basically, from what they indicated, the wells notice addresses the staking business, which we already know. Kraken was sued by the SEC, and they settled over Kraken staking business, potentially being a security and staking business. And also some of them. Some of the assets listed on Coinbase also being unregistered securities. So that's the indication we've gotten from Coinbase. Now, Coinbase issued a pretty scathing response on twitter and in a blog post, basically saying that they met with the SEC more than 30 times in the last nine months, gave them zero feedback directly on what to change or how to register. They asked Coinbase to give proposals on what registration would look like. Coinbase wrote up like they put a lot of time and energy into writing out proposals at the SEC's request about what a path for crypto exchange registration might look like. And the SEC basically ignored them, canceled their last meeting, and then popped them with a wells notice without giving them any indication over all of their conversations, which, of course, Coinbase is known as being the most compliant, most kind of compliance, first exchange in the US, besides maybe Gemini, which likes to yell that they're very compliant. But Coinbase is obviously the biggest and the brightest within the industry. This kind of rocked a lot of people because it sort of shows that the SEC at this point is going after everyone. Doesn't matter how good or bad of an actor you are, there's basically a full court press from the administration at this point to go after crypto. So what were your guys thoughts seeing the wells notice at this point? It kind of feels like this happened months ago, but this was just last week since our last show. It feels pretty momentous. Now. Coinbase has this very belligerent attitude about it, which is great to see. And Coinbase, as far as I can tell, they have such a good case against the SEC, given all the facts of their engagement with the SEC and all the attempts that they've made in good faith to try to get the SEC to give them some kind of positive indication of what they should be doing. But Gensler said publicly he thinks everything besides bitcoin is security, in which case compliance would basically mean become a bitcoin only exchange, which would just be obvious."

The other, the other big news from the CFT, sorry. From the SEC as well this week, was them going after Tron. So the SEC filed a lawsuit against Justin sun for unregistered securities violations, market manipulation of just tons of wash trading of Tron. I think they had a bunch of employees just repeatedly wash selling on different exchanges, as well as paying celebrities to endorse TrON and not disclosing payments, as well as the celebrities themselves. So who do we have on the list? Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Soulja Boy, Neo Akon, and of course, Lil Yachty, who we all know and love. All of them were hit by the SEC for basically endorsing, I think, Tron. I think it was mostly Tron that they were endorsing or tron ecosystem tokens. On the whole, it looks like basically every angle now is coming down. This feels one very coordinated. Obviously, you also have FDIC doing the debanking. You have the SEC going after celebrities, you have CFTC and the SEC going after exchanges. You've got do Kwon getting arrested in Montenegro, which may be coincidental, but it, it sort of fills in the pastiche that this now feels like a full court press, particularly within the US. But also the moment that Doquan was arrested, by the way, there were also charges unsealed by New York prosecutors against do Kwon, basically jockeying to get him extradited to New York for trial. So at this point, it's very hard to say that this is not coming straight from the executive of saying, hey, I want heads, let's go after everything in crypto, because everything in this industry needs to go."

But some of them, such as Coinbase, it seems like they're going to fight pretty hard, and it's clear what the basis of the case would be. But Gensler is out in two years anyway. The suit is more of the point versus actually winning the suit. And I think there's also rumors coming out that this ripple lawsuit, they might be able to settle. And that's why you've seen XRP kind of pumping lately. And so I don't know if it's like all of these things are going to have sort of the same outcome, I guess, or it's going to be sort of this one sort of monolithic act across all these different crypto companies. But it does somehow feel that, hey, in the past two months, we've seen more action than we've seen in the past two years, effectively. It's hard not to think that, like, there's something going on behind the scenes."

        "text": "Yeah, this feels like probably one of the most important questions over the next year is what's going to happen with us regulatory action against crypto. I agree with you that actually a lot of these things, I think if you sort of look at them separately, the debanking stuff, it feels like already there's been a lot of public attention on this debanking of crypto that I think they thought was going to be more quiet because they were kind of pushing through back channels like there was no real, there was no real transparency around how they were doing. It, and now there's op eds in the Wall Street Journal. This stuff is now getting very public that, hey, FDIC is kind of putting the elbow on the scales and trying to push banks to not work with crypto companies. And people are pissed off about this. I think this perceived as being a sort of extralegal crossing of a boundary, that FTSE really should not be doing the same thing. I think with the SEC action against Coinbase, I think people mostly perceive this as being excessive. And at least in the court of public opinion, it looks really bad for the SEC. If in fact they do bring a lawsuit, they might not. To be clear, a wells notice doesn't mean that there's a lawsuit filed. They might decide not to file the lawsuit. Just upon seeing the response of Coinbase, we're also just seeing that like, hey, this is going to be super unpopular and we're not going to win, so let's not even bother bringing the lawsuit. But this stuff with binance definitely is going to play. There's just no, no way that we're not going to see this as being one of the most important stories of the year is the CFTC lawsuit against binance and whatever else comes from it. And it does kind of feel like this is kind of the way that the cycle will truly come to an end, right? In some ways, the 2017 to 2018 cycle, the biggest exchange was BitMex. And the cycle, in a way, was not really over until the full kind of denouement of Arthur finally finding himself under indictment. Not that I wanted him to, but in some way, that was the resolution of the cycle. And in some way, binance has been the overwhelming winner of this cycle. And seeing them finally fall, whether it be one from just a death by 1000 cuts of customers, having to basically abandon them, because it's just too dicey to deal with Binance or two, just because CZ is literally forced to step down, hand over the reins, they have to divest a lot of their businesses, and things just become chaos over there. And people just naturally be like, okay, shit, this exchange is a mess. I dont want to trade here anymore. If Binance loses the throne, its going to be painful in the short term because so much of the market, so much of the global market for crypto is on binance. Theyre like 60% of the global market is just on that single exchange. So it is the market today. If binance goes under, its going to be super painful, a lot of things are going to get hurt, a lot of people are going to get hurt. A lot of startups are going to get hurt, but ultimately the industry is going to reorganize around whatever the new exchanges are. And the end of the day, the industry is really about the technology, its about the assets, its about bitcoin and ether and all the stuff thats getting built, not about who happens to be the biggest exchange today."

But I'm not. So I don't know if the end of binance is sort of the end of the world in some ways, but I still think that people do want perpetual futures in general are an innovation that's not going away. People like them, and they're reasons that they're really hard to do with real commodities. Because your physical delivery, you have all this settlement risk stuff like, look at, look at the London Mercantile Exchange recently found that 0.8% of the nickel in their warehouses was actually stone. Stuff like that completely changes your contract specs and product in some sense. And I hope Gensler is listening to this. Crypto is the most pure commodity. As a commodity, it has immediate delivery properties and has all the properties that all the commodities trading on CME, LME, whatever your X, JSX, whatever, all of those things are all like these approximate contracts. It's like, oh, we're selling you hog futures, and the hogs are between 45 pounds and 65 pounds. Sometimes you might not get that many of the 65 pound ones. And there's some sense in which crypto is actually the most pure quality that, you know, your delivery is like exactly a particular thing, and you can build these cleaner financial products, like perpetual futures on them. So the real question is, will DeFi ever be able to stand up alternatives that are compelling enough to these users? And hopefully this is a good push to push us in that direction."

DeFi had this rebound immediately after the collapse of FTX. But then things went back to trendline, which is that defi is cool, it's great, people like it. But ultimately, most people are going to be using c five because they don't know how to use metamask, they don't know how to self custody, they don't know how to do any of the stuff. Of course, a lot of what binance does, and this is where I have to give a lot of credit to binance. Binance is operating in so many countries where nobody else is operating. They're doing so much for consumers in places where almost nobody else even bothers to offer consumer services, aside from just trade. Bitcoin. Right. Most people, most exchanges, they're not nearly as deeply entrenched into people's lives as binance was. And that's part of the reason why they created such incredible business and why they're so beloved by their consumers. So it would be great to see a world where binance can survive, because, like, the enterprise value of what they've built is so massive. My worry is just that so much of it has just been tainted by the way in which it was built, that we're going to have to go through the painful process of somebody else stepping up to that mantle, or just going into a world that is just more quote unquote decentralized in that there is not going to be any single player that has 60% market share and therefore operates in every single nook and cranny of these small countries where nobody else can afford to have a ground game besides binance. Binance is incredibly efficient company. You know, they're obviously incredibly profitable. They're very, very good at what they do, and it's a testament to what CZ has built. But unfortunately, he just was driving too fast and he's caught too many tickets along the way that I don't know if he's going to be able to keep driving this car into the next decade. I keep taking these metaphors and kind of pulling them better than the punchbowl, at least."

Binance operates the tech and changed the branding and helps them with marketing and go to market and whatever. But I mean, the one thing that became very clear, especially from that CFTC lawsuit, is that everything was just controlled by CZ. Same way that we saw with FTX. Everything was controlled by Sam. So most of these exchanges are very, very, very centralized in the leader and of all these companies and all these little shells and all this stuff, CZ was always at the center of it. It continues to be at the center of it. I do think it'll be painful if CZ is suddenly pulled out and binance somehow has to continue operating. But I agree with you. I think it's likely that in some of these places, like Binance us, I think, I think you're right. Binance us is probably not viable without the binance branding. But in most of these jurisdictions, binance has just built such an incredibly, like, such a committed user base, and they're just so good at what they do."

So I don't know if that's been confirmed to be true, but it's very, very clear. Hong Kong is now positioning themselves to open back up to digital assets and China itself. Beijing, kind of behind closed doors, is basically silently nodding and saying, okay, great, this is going to be the sandbox through which we allow digital assets to start coming back into the region. Hong Kong is basically a way. I mean, Hong Kong is like very, you know, it's basically rich people and then people who've been native Hong Kongers. And it's essentially a way of saying, okay, if we allow it in Hong Kong, that essentially allows high net worth to get access to it without allowing chinese retail, you know, the lobaishing, the sort of ordinary people in China to potentially get fleeced by, you know, NFT scams and icos and all this other nonsense. So from China's perspective, it's funny because China bans crypto, basically every bull cycle. 2021 was actually the third time they banned crypto, which tells you their bans are a little bit watery if they keep having to re ban it. But that's the way China operates, is that China, they ban something and then they let it come back in the corners and they don't quite enforce this thing, and they owe this little loophole people are using. We'll let them keep doing that and watch and see how it develops because I think what China dislikes about crypto is not crypto per se, but what they don't like is disorder and bull markets and crypto are really fucking disorderly, right? They are crazy people scamming pyramid schemes, NFT fraud, all this. Things just go totally nuts in China every time there's a crypto bull market, and that's what China tams down on. But once things are calm, which right now they're very calm in a way, it also does feel like the thing I was saying earlier, that this is kind of the natural evolution of the cycle, right? The same thing happened, China banned icos in 2017. They were like, oh, this is all crazy, you guys arent allowed to do this. They tamped down on everything and then slowly but surely started to come back and people started to do crypto startups again, and exchanges started to offer stuff to chinese people again, and RMB started to get traded for USDT again and it started to come back and this feels like, oh, were at that point in the handing off of this cycle to the next one where the big exchange founder gets hit, the all coins pull back, and the hype cycle has gone away. China reopens again, new licensing regulatory regimes start figuring out how they're going to start operating this stuff.

There was some, and they're us public companies, they have to report this. So it's like, you can see this stuff, there's definitely this thing of in the self driving car and I sort of like visual, like tag tagging, image tagging, video tagging stuff. There was always this idea that like, China was way ahead of the US in AI, but in the language stuff, it's like clear that the US has basically steamrolled everyone. And you're starting to see this kind of like national angst. Like Britain was like, we're going to build our own open AI and we're going to fund it with government money and call it Brit GPT. Like literally the prime minister. Yes, it was like hilarious. So there's a lot of this weird national pride stuff. And I actually think someone is going to be like, hey, look, we lost the race in AI, but, you know, where we can actually win is crypto.

And actually, that was the first time that I think in the people's Daily, which is the big chinese state owned newspaper, they wrote this piece basically saying bitcoin and ether are fantastic innovations, they're wonderful for society, blah, blah, blah, which is unheard of that China would say something like that. And then, of course, they backpedaled after they banned crypto to say, oh, actually, no, these things are bad. They're speculative. So everything, I think in China particularly is very, like, China understands that crypto is really important. They don't necessarily know what to do with it, but they know that it's really important. And they know, they see the US is now giving up the lead and they see that other countries are not right. Other countries are not doing the same thing. Japan is not doing that. Korea is not doing that. Europe is not doing that. Pretty much at this point, the US is the odd man out when it comes to countries reactions to crypto.
