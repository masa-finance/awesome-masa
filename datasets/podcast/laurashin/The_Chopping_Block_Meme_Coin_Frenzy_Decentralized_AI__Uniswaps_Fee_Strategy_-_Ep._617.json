Now, interestingly so, bitcoin basically went right up to then retreated. I think right now, as we're recording, it's like 67.5. Somewhere in that ballpark. There was a great article in coindesk that pointed out how in most currencies, bitcoin has already surpassed all time highs because the dollar has been very strong relative to most currencies. So in Korea, in India, in Europe, bitcoins already surpassed all time highs, but in dollar terms, bitcoin is slightly below all time highs, but it has really cemented bitcoin mania at this point, bitcoin has pulled ahead of almost everything, except for, of course, meme coins, which are going nuts, which we'll also talk about. How does it feel now emerging on the other side of what was. I mean, people were calling it a bear market for really quite late now. I'm hearing people say it's starting to be a bull market.

Of course, Kwame has been down a couple of times within the last week, which is also a bull market sign of like, hey, things are falling over again. It hasn't happened on any of the other exchanges.

I don't think there was many large, there was Solana and stuff like that. But now you see much smaller projects doing treasury sales, and I feel like that's a difference qualitatively.

I think May 31 is the big date for whether or not the ether ETF will be approved. And then I suspect what happens is. So right now, I think polymarket is pricing it at roughly 50 50. Whether the ether ETF gets approved by May 31. If it doesn't get approved, almost certainly lawsuit time, people are going to see the SEC. And I think at this point, most people expect the SEC.

So, like, the SEC, ultimately, I mean, people who work at the SEC, they want jobs after they get kicked out if there's turnover in the administration. Right. And so if you are the enemy to, like, the biggest product in the history of ETF's, it's just like, okay, well, great. Nobody will ever hire you. You're an asshole. Fuck you. So I think the other thing they realized is that, look, we were worried about the bad things happening. No, bad things have happened. It has been smooth sailing. It has been totally wonderful. And so to the extent you were worried about market manipulation or whatever boogeyman they were claiming, no, the CME also trades ether. Whatever happened to bitcoin should also happen to ether. And so it seems like I would think it's more likely, especially given that the same players are at the table of Blackrock and fidelity and so on, that if that was the sign that, like, hey, the bitcoin ETF is going to get approved, it seems to me like the same should be true of the ether ETF.

I mean, if something went badly, you would think, okay, the percentage should go down. So things went great. That should mean the percentage goes up. I would think. Anyway. I mean, obviously I'm not a ceasera for the SEC, but I think what happens is that ethers first in line, once you get ether in, then you probably get litecoin, XRP, things that already have more or less either XRP case, they won at least the preliminary case before there's an appeal. And then for litecoin, nobody gives a shit. Litecoin trades enough that it's definitely not security. Then you go to Solana, and then Solana is a fight, because they have claimed, affirmatively, that Solana security, whereas they've never claimed that ether is security. They've just never said anything about it. So I think that's probably how it goes. And if the Solana fight happens, then you get next in line. Next in line, next in line. And so you get Avax and Nier and blah, blah, blah. They're probably 7th, 8th in line."

Everything is in the eye of the beholder. And therefore it's kind of like the Wall street bets view of the world is like, whatever. You hedge funds are playing the stupid, boring state game. If we don't play that game, then financial markets are just a different thing. And so it is with Geo Bowdoin. We all decide, geo Bowdoin's hilarious.

I don't want anyone to control me. Whether I can use this model. Maybe I have a query that normally would not be allowed on a centralized provider, whatever it is. Or I have an anime model and anime, this anime stuff is trained on unlicensed data that whatever. Insert your use case here. So that is ritual. Ritual is decentralized inference. Correct.

        "speaker": "A",

And this has kind of been the holy dream grail for a long time, right? Like everything from the graph of like I have indexing that's off chain, but I prove some portion of it on chain to the ZK versions, like axiom where I take previous state and I can prove that, like, hey, this was what happened in ethereum historically versus having to like index manually and like be a centralized index provider. Right. Like the dunes or nansens and stuff, which I think you'll always have. Right. They're always going to be way faster. And so there's a reason for that. But for some use cases where contracts actually need some either historical queries or models processed on historical queries to make a decision about themselves, you're giving them an ability to look in their past. Right. Now, if you look at how blockchain state works, either I increase the cost to the user by storing much more historical state, or I'm autonomous in a time, one sense, I only use the current state. I can't really look backwards. But in reality, a lot of applications, most applications, you're right, need some notion of historical state. And I think all of these things are giving you different ways of getting at that. And it's more a question of how do you value it? How much security do you want for that?"

So, like, ZKMl gonna be very slow. Like right now, that's kind of, you know, I can do a, I can do a single decision tree. I can do a couple boosted trees. It's. It's not like a real.

So it's just, you look at the blocks and it's filled with each step of the thing instead of just like, oh, I verified one thing. I think that the idea is to really find a way of figuring how to batch these things and make it easier. Now, the hard part, I think, for using it for something that's really high value, like Defi, is that you're creating a bunch of mev people can see exactly what your mod, like in order for the verification to work, the entire thing is open source. Why can't I run it locally and front run your transaction? You create all this. So we're not still at the point that that's settled.

I think it comes down to a cost basis thing more than a like you could do the inference or the computation from the queries on chain, but now you're just bloating your on chain contract.

How much bandwidth are you going to put on this network? Not only am I saying you have to do all this compute, I'm saying you have to stay up and like, you're extremely dedicable.

There was just Ionet that just announced, I think, billion dollar valuation that they raised a bunch of money at. My view on this is more or less that I think there is stuff that's investable here, but I think decentralized inference in GPU marketplaces, I think GPU marketplace is unequivocally their thing. I don't know how big they will be, because ultimately they're always going to be playing at a disadvantageous relative to the centralized players who just can get the economies of scale, they can get better inventory, they can route things more efficiently than the decentralized players. If you look at vast AI, when everybody compares the decentralized marketplaces like Akash and render to Amazon, Amazon is three times the cost, but they never put it next to vast AI, which is the centralized version of the exact same thing, which always is 5% cheaper than the decentralized versions. And so my view here is that I just don't know. I think where crypto excels is where there's a lot of censorship, is where people don't want you to trade GPU's or do whatever. I don't think there's anybody getting in the way of you wanting sshing into somebody's GPU."

So I think the reality is that, yes, if you're on OpenAI and they see that you're shoveling in thousands of frames of studio Ghibli movies, they're gonna be like, yo, you obviously don't have the rights to this, but I think most of the places where you can just rent a GPU, even on Amazon, you go rent a GPU, they're not gonna check what you're doing."

But then all of a sudden all these data center operators like the rack spaces of the world started realizing, oh my God, 90% of our revenue is going to pay Microsoft licenses. We got to lower that. And they started having Linux. Then eventually once the, you know, web 2.0 companies I guess existed, then they started eating up all that space and they needed just tons of servers and it became so much more cost effective that Linux was sort of enshrined at data centers. But would you rather have invested in rackspace or Google?

So, Uniswap recently had a governance proposal from the Uniswap foundation that proposed to finally turn on the fee switch. So for those of you who don't know, Uniswap is an amm. It's the biggest on chain Dex. And Uniswap has never actually taken a fee. There is a fee on Uniswap, of course, but it goes to the people who are providing liquidity on Uniswap. The protocol itself, or unitoken or uni dao, gets nothing. So the assumption has more or less been that this is for regulatory reasons. Maybe this makes Uniswap a security. Maybe there's some other reason why they've been avoiding fighting this fight. And people assumed that the community was going to end up having to drive this, and the foundation was going to be hands off. And what we've seen is the opposite, which really took a lot of people by surprise, which is that the foundation was the one that proposed to turn on the fee switch. And now it seems like it's likely to pass the flying callers. Everybody's very excited about this. And all of Defi has pumped with uni leading the pack on this thought that, do they know something we don't know? Is there a reason why they think that now is the time that they can go in and turn on the fee switch without concerns about being targeted by the SEC or something? Or other. First of all, Defi founder, any alpha or anything. What do you think is driving this?"

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Here's my take, and I don't have any alpha. It's not really just turning on the fee switch. Actually, more than that fee switch is one piece of this. The second piece, which I think is actually more important, is that the fees will be diverted to uni stakers who not just stake, but also delegate their votes into the governance process. You have to assume that the ones who are actually delegating in governance is a significant subset of the overall token holders. And the idea is that the fee switch will be diverted into those who are staking and participating in governance. So I don't know what percent of unis delegated. I mean, as of today, whatever the number is, it will be higher in my expectation after this system is rolled out. But let's just assume that there's 20% of Uni tokens that are actually staked, that are not sitting on exchanges, sitting in cold storage, sitting in a format that's not participating. I've seen estimates that the fee switch will lead to somewhere between $60 to $150 million of fees, given current prices. The current market, $60 to $150 million directed to maybe 20% of token holders is per year, is incredibly significant, and it transforms uni, the protocol and the token from something that the token today is used for votes, but those votes are really only on the treasury. It doesn't seem that meaningful. It transforms it from something that's not that meaningful to one of the most important economic systems in crypto, period, where the fees are going to be more than most l one blockchains, period, full stop. And it suddenly catapults uni into a position where I think it'll be one of the most analyzed and most talked about systems, period."

It does seem like the market is more or less pricing in that the regulatory environment is shifting, or at least the winds are shifting. So obviously the SEC is expected to continue to be obstructionist. But I think the whole industry feels like it has more ammunition and in some sense it feels like uni is the battering Ramirez that everybody else can get behind and say, okay, well, if unis doing this, were probably good because theyre going to go after uni because theyre the biggest, baddest guy on the block. And so I suspect thats a little bit of the energy in DeFi right now thats booing all these tokens. And if they go after uni, which we know that Unis had run ins with the CFTC at least, and the SEC almost certainly has chatted with them, that theres going to be a showdown at some point with respect to Defi in the US. So assuming that the SEC gets around to it and they don't end up churning out after if there's a handoff in the administration. So we'll see right now, I mean, I think we got to wrap because we're getting up on time, but it's a wild market. My guess is that probably by this time next week, all time highs in bitcoin at least, I mean, we've already hit dollar terms. We touched all time high very, very."
