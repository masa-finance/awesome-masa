Then we've got Tarun, the giga brain and grand Poobah at Gauntlet. And today we've got a special guest, Jesse Pollock, the layer two linchpin and leader of base. And finally, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. We're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. Jesse, it's great to have you on the show. We've been trying for a while to get you on and we've been talking a lot of shit about base, and so we thought it was probably time to get you on here to be able to defend your creation.

Huge fan, longtime listener. How does it feel that base is popping off. I mean, it's cool, it's awesome. It's exciting to see so much of the ecosystem excited about what we're doing. I think it also feels like it's still day one. We have so much more to go, so much further to build. I think when we think about what success looks like, it's bringing billions of people on chain. And I think the reality is that today there's hundreds of thousands of people on chain, kind of best case scenario. And so there's just a lot more work to do. And I don't want to get distracted by the short term stuff, mostly just focused on the long term we're building towards."

Obviously the Defi stuff is happening too, and nfts. But I think it feels to me like we're a little bit of an inflection point right now where we're starting to see real consumer use cases that actually have the potential to bring in millions of people, tens of millions of people, and that's probably what gets me the most fired up, actually."

There's something like 30,000 developers in crypto today, and it feels achievable for us to get like 100 x or something like 100 x on the developer side. Similarly, on the user side, there's like maybe a million people on chain, but somewhere between ten and 100 million people who've used crypto before. And again there it seems possible to get ten to 100 x. And so I think mostly what we're saying is like, let's set some ambitious goals that are achievable but also kind of like pretty far out. And those felt like the right ones. And then they had the nice kind of balance of also being easy to say, easy to repeat, easy to drill home as kind of the north starts for our team, which I think is really important when you're setting goals."

And then last weekend, it sort of went even higher where you had a lot of actually normies started to get on the platform of like, NBA players and some, you know, less crypto native venture capitalists who started getting into the game. What have you guys been seeing and how do you think about you basically now have this kind of super tenant in the same way we often talked about this back in the day on Solana of Solana being like this sort of super tenant blockchain where there's one app that's taking almost all of the energy and transaction volume and tvl that seems to be friend tech right now for base. How do you guys think about that? And how do you think about supporting an app that is driving most of the attention for base today?"

    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. Well, first off, I think it's been really exciting to see and racer and shrimp and the whole team are awesome. They've been building social experiences on chain for a long time. You know, like Steelcam before friend Tech, I think, was really innovative and they learned a lot from that. Now it's cool to see them kind of like, run it back and start to have some success with Fronttech. So we're really excited about that. And I think our general thesis is we want to help builders be successful on base. And this is a product that's starting to be really successful. And so we're leaning in to figure out how we can support them. There's a bunch of ways we're doing that. Um, you know, you probably see me talking about front tech pretty frequently. Uh, so trying to kind of just like support from a messaging and narrative perspective, from a technology perspective, we're obviously leaning in to make sure they have all the tools and resources that they need in order to be successful. Um, and then from a kind of ecosystem perspective, uh, inasmuch as they have dependencies or, you know, other things that they need to get solved, we're kind of behind the scenes trying to make that happen. And so it's kind of all hands on deck. And I think in general, my feeling on this is we're at this point where we're going to start seeing this happen. Like, not one off, but frequently you're going to start having real products that get built, and those products aren't going to follow the growth cycle that we're used to in crypto for the last decade, which is kind of flat, but the technology is actually ready now where we're going to start having consumer products that are launched and they grow and they grow week over week, month over month, quarter over quarter, and they reach millions of people and tens of millions of people and billions of people. And I think that's going to be so exciting. And for us, it's like, that's what it's all about. It's finding and supporting the people who are creating those products, giving them everything they need in order to build them and grow them, and then trying to just hang on and make sure that we can actually keep scaling the infrastructure so that it's ready for the level of transactions we put, they're trying to put through it, and ready for the number of people who are actually going to come on chain."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I'm actually curious about this also in the context of fronttech, given that steelcam was on arbitrum. And so I'm curious, in your conversation with Eraser, kind of driving the decision to build on base this time around."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah. So first off, I think our general thesis on this is that it's going to take all of us, right? It's not going to be just base that scales Ethereum. It's going to be a massive kind of team effort from all these layer twos that are working together to make Ethereum scale. And it's kind of like the bottoms up version of the original scaling strategy for Ethereum, where we actually have a bunch of these layer twos that come together to provide kind of throughput for Ethereum overall. And so first and foremost, the pie is still very small. We need to grow the pie and get it massive. And that's going to be something that we all do kind of in collaboration. I think the second thought, and the thing that I think we have the opportunity to do really well kind of differentiate on, is getting that kind of end to end user experience really seamless, both for builders and users. And this comes really from the kind of close collaboration that we have with Coinbase. Base is obviously being incubated inside of Coinbase. And what that means is that I think we have a really clear visibility into basically the whole cycle of a user, from the consumer interface and Coinbase and Coinbase wallet all the way through to the underlying chain infrastructure that exists with base. I think what that's going to allow us to do is it's basically allow us to look at every step in the user journey from getting your wallet, getting a seed phrase and figuring how to back that up all the way through to funding your wallet, all the way through to using the first app, and then being retained in the DAP over time and figure out how do we optimize that super, super relentlessly. I think that's kind of a unique thing that base and Coinbase have together in collaboration. I get to go and sit and work with those teams every day to make sure that they are, to make sure that we're working in the right direction. Now. I wish I could say that that was all perfect and that's the solution. It's like, oh, now everything works. And if you build on base, it's going to be 100% seamless for every user that's coming in. The reality is we're not there yet and we have a lot more work to do. But I think that feedback loop is the thing that gets me really, really excited. And then in terms of just front text specifically. Tom, going back to your question, I've had a bunch of conversations with Racer over the last few months. Our team had a bunch of conversations with Racer, the whole team over the last few months, and they were excited about base, we were excited about them, we found ways to support them and lean in and we're grateful that they're building with us. And so there's not like one thing here. I'd say it's more just like a bunch of opportunities coming together and us getting to work together to build a future. So super excited about building with them."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, I think it's still really early in the journey. They started building this however many months ago. We tapped in with them and started listening and hearing what their needs were, their needs around distribution and social, and we figured out how to make that happen. Although I think there's more we can do there then. Right now we're thinking a lot about technology. Basically, like how do we make it easier for people to get funds into friend tech? How do we make it easier for them to scale on top of base? How do we make it easier for people to do their first transaction? And so those are a bunch of conversations that we're having right now, basically trying to figure out what can we do to make these product experiences more seamless."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So if I can read between the lines a little bit, Jesse, naively, I would think that, ok, you guys are launching an op stack rollup. As far as I understand, it's more or less op stack off the shelf. There's not maybe a lot of modifications you guys are making directly to how the blockchain runs. So I would assume that when you say, look, we're doing stuff to support them, it's like co marketing, making the bridging experience easy. Maybe having an integration with Coinbase wallet. Is that the kind of thing that you guys are gesturing at when you say supporting them or are there other things that I'm not imagining there?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that that's exactly right. Yeah. It's basically figuring out how do we make the experience more seamless, how do we help them get distribution, how do we make sure that their users are getting easy first transactions into the app."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Got it. Got it. Okay, so one of the things that's interesting that many people have commented on between base and the other l two s is that most of the other l two s have a token. And that token is often used to attract developers, subsidize early applications. There's a playbook and we all know the playbook we're all in crypto base presumably does not have access to that playbook because you guys don't have a token. And my understanding is that you guys don't plan to. How do you think about that when you're thinking about, hey, I want to attract the marginal entrepreneur, I can't wave a token around and say, hey, blah, blah, blah, come get it. So what do you think of as the different kind of value proposition you have versus an optimism or an arbitrum or a ZK saying that can make the same kind of claim?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think when we look at the space over the last kind of five years, I think that what we see basically is that there's been a lot of economic incentives for people to make certain technology decisions which at times have obscured, like, product incentives of, like, this product works really well, or it's easy to use, or it's something that we all want to build in from a community perspective. And so I think our thesis is like, there's actually an opportunity if we decouple those things and focus on just building a really great product, whether that product is the blockchain itself or the blockchain plus distribution through Coinbase and the Coinbase brand and channels, et cetera. Or that, plus the community that is being built around base and just let that stand on its own. That's basically what we're focused on. It's what can we do to basically make it so this is something that people want to use intrinsically rather than something that people want to use extrinsically. I think there's still opportunities for us to use financial levers. Right? For instance, right now we're running a prop house round, which is kind of Noun's infrastructure for rewarding people retroactively for contributions that they made. We're running that for on chain summer and building on base. And we've seen more submissions to that than any prop house round in history because there's just so much energy and excitement. And I think that that's a great example of, like, you don't have to have a token to start experimenting with and using structures to reward people for contributing to an ecosystem. And I think we're excited about doing that in a more rigorous way because we don't just have kind of this endless economic thing that is a little bit of magic, but instead we have kind of like the rigor of trying to figure out how do we, a, make this product work really, really well, but then b, how do we create structures that align incentives and bring people in and reward them for their contributions and help them grow and be successful."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I love that. And I think it shows a lot of clarity of understanding what the value proposition is of having a layer two backed by a super massive consumer facing exchange like Coinbase. You guys have a different set of advantages. And it sounds like you're leveraging them really well. It's been notable looking at the stats. So I just want to run through a couple of stats real quick about how quickly base has been growing. The daily active addresses on base is now over 100,000 transactions per day, nearing 1 million, which actually puts you on a per day basis or, like, you know, hourly basis. You guys are doing more TPS than any other l two, actually. You guys are now doing more TPS than. Than Ethereum itself. Now, interestingly, a lot of this TPS seems to be bots, and specifically, it looks like there's a lot of mev bots that are now playing around on base. And so I was reading a thread this morning by Bert from flashbots, and basically he describes this phenomenon that when somebody bridges in. So it's a little bit complicated if you don't understand how friends dot tech works. But basically, the idea of friendtech is that when somebody signs up on friendtech, they, I guess, claim their account, and then you can start trading their shares, but you can actually buy their shares before they even exist on Friendtech. So you can sort of buy them in advance of them claiming them and starting to market themselves."

        "text": "Well, then, so, interestingly. Interestingly, just this morning, I guess, the back running bots that must have ran up my bonnet, because I did, when I signed up, I was like, huh, my price is actually weirdly high. This seems kind of difficult for people to buy because it's $200. It was like $100 when I first signed up. And I was like, really? You start at $100? That's really weird. But I was like, oh, maybe it's tied to my Twitter followers or something. I didn't even think about it. And then over the day, I was like, oh, hey, guys, buy my shares. Whatever. Now they're called keys. Buy my keys. Obviously, totally innocuous reasons. They changed the word from shares to keys. Then this morning, the price of my shares just lopped in half. I was like, wait, what the fuck happened? Because I didn't see any sales on the platform. And somebody on Twitter said, probably it's that the platform is not indexing sales that are happening off platform, which meant that probably what happened was that the front runners who drove up my share price initially market sold everything this morning back down the bonding curve and basically just dumped on everybody who owned my keys. So that seems to be what happened, which is. Yeah, which is a super bummer. But, like, also, I didn't show any of this on the actual UI. So anyway, I thought it was very interesting. Jesse, I don't know if you have any thoughts on seeing this kind of organic, crazy crypto sniping behavior starting to dominate on base. I mean, it's a sign that things are working, but it's also a kind of weird side effect of things working."

    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "When you think about it, it's crypto, right? Like, this is, this is what we've been seeing in crypto for, I think the whole history of crypto, that when there's activity and excitement and energy, you get a bunch of new emergent behaviors that you maybe couldn't predict. A lot of it ends up being put into fast running software systems that simulate what humans might do if they had the opportunity to do it at the speed that the software systems can do it. And then you get more efficient markets, you get a bunch of learnings out of it, and you get a natural equilibrium where people end up figuring it out. And so I kind of see this as the journey that we're on. Base has been around for two weeks. Friend tech has been around for two weeks. We have a lot more work to do to figure out how do all these systems fit together in a way that can reach billions of people. And so that's mostly what we're focused on. It's like, how do we make this work really well for the next million people, and how do we make sure that that's done in a way that's super thoughtful?"

And obviously most of those applications have not really worked. What I'd love to do is just do a little bit of a tear down and a bit of a retro of like, why has frontech been so effective? What are the things that it got right, that many other applications that tried to do the same kind of thing? The idea of speculating on your friends or on social media identities is actually an old idea. It's actually been tried many times before in crypto and in previous iterations. It didn't really work. So I'm curious from a lot of you, but Jesse and also Tom True and Robert, what have you seen in friendtech that they got right that other previous attempts to do this have failed?"

I think it's very easy to comp into bit cloud, which is probably the most in recent memory. Closest similar product to what Frontex doing very, very different technical approach, like rolling its own vch fork that you had to bridge into this weird little separate thing versus building on an l two with ETH that's much more approachable and has a much more adjacent market. But I think more specifically, I think the choice of doing a progressive web app plus using a wallet as a service product like privy, it feels as good as you can get without building a truly native application, which is obviously difficult with the app store policies."

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, so people can log in to privy, which is this wall as a service company. These NPC to store your private key across multiple different computers. But you can log in using your phone number, which is kind of the standard auth that people use today. You can use Google, you can use Apple. That sort of auth experience is what people are used to from a modern social application. And a lot of people have been trying to build these kinds of services or these kinds of products and push them to the app store. Apple has been pretty antagonistic with respect to their policies on crypto, trying to either ban it entirely or push it through its 30% fee on digital purchases. Because Fronttech is not a native application, it's a progressive web application. It runs in your browser, but it looks and feels a little bit like a native application. It doesn't have to go through the app store. You can just put it on your phone directly because it's accessing a website, you don't need to go through the App store policy. It's been pretty massive, I think, in terms of distribution and onboarding. In addition to these choices around using a proper l two like base, not for any ideological reason, but simply for the ease of access to the developer tooling, the user ergonomics that people are used to, I think those have been pretty massive. Then from a product decision. Again, one of the issues with Bitcloud was the exact thing you were talking about with back running, where people could speculate on shares before people were live on the platform. Obviously that pissed people off, but it also created this experience where it was not very dense party. You didn't know who was actively on the platform, whose shares you were actually going to engage with, and they would actually respond. You know that when you're buying a share, someone has actually chosen to be on the platform and it's like a live player. And so I think those are some of like the small decisions that actually add up to a cumulative different experience than some of the other comps that we've seen in the ecosystem, I was gonna say."

And the thing that I think they've done really well is that whether it's sniper bots accumulating the keys like humans accumulating the keys, there's this very quick positive reward loop, economically and mentally. When you log on, you've been a user for a minute, and for some reason, there's more ether in your address than what you deposited. So you deposit dollar 20 of ether, and then you look your phone, you're like, wait, I have $150 worth of ether. What happened? And I think the thing that they nailed is that as soon as you sign up, you have free money in a very visceral way. I haven't really experienced that in too many other applications, and I think it's such a powerful mechanism that I think is under explored. And it's a function of that bonding curve combined with the fact that individuals, the one receiving the portion of the trading fees off of every purchase and sale, but just like 1 minute into your application experience, seeing extra money.

First off, I think just from a virality perspective, Racer is the best in the game in crypto right now at creating that. And so like separate and distinct from the product. I feel like just watching him work is honestly, like inspiring something special in terms of kind of bringing the right people in, playing the timing in the right way. And so huge credit to him and the team for, I think, like landing that. I think what Robert said on the product side is totally right. They've really nailed the experience for just like the individual who's creating the room, because you feel like you want to keep engaging, because it's just, it's a feedback loop that's positive, where if you do the right engagement, you're going to earn a little bit more money, you're going to get access to more people, people are going to start engaging with you. I think that's really been awesome to see. But then going back to what Tom said, I think that the component of this where they, I think are really the first people to bring together all of these technology pieces that have been coming, but not quite there, and that when they fit together, actually make it a better experience than we've ever seen in crypto. And that's pretty uniquely possible because of what ethereum does. Right? Like the NPC wallet privy, right. We've been talking to them for a long time. I've known Henry, the founder, for a long time. And they added, they built on base and they also support other EVM chains. And that just works. Like they could just decide to use that. They were having scaling issues and we reached out and we're talking to them and we got them on a new node provider to have more scalability for their front end. That just works because of Ethereum. When they first launched, they didn't have a bridging mechanism in the app. And then they pretty quickly just added the ability to bridge natively in the app from l one to l two. And that just works because of the way the op stack is built. And so I think there's like a bunch of these pieces that just work. But that just work is the result of basically like seven years of infrastructure investments that have happened from teams on Ethereum, l one, from teams on l two, from teams on building this kind of infrastructure around it all. And that is what enables it to fit together and enables the person to get to the experience that Robert's talking about from a product perspective in like 30 seconds, rather than what you were talking about Haseed with bitcoin, where it was like ten minutes. And then when you're in that bitcout world, you don't have access to that kind of rapid iteration where it's like, oh, this node fryer doesn't work. Like, swap in a new one. Oh, this bridge experience isn't great. Let's upgrade the bridge experience. Let's add a pay instant on ramp from a credit card. That speed of iteration that I think is enabled by EVM and the technology ecosystem that's been built around EVM, I think is going to enable this next generation of apps. And I think Friendtech has really been, it's like the first one. They're first through the line in trying that out, making the pieces fit together and building a really compelling product experience around it. So huge kudos to them for, I think, showing all of us like, whoa, this is now finally possible."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "The other thing that I found striking about friendtech versus the previous attempts to build these kind of social trading type experiences is that this innovation of having the chat rooms. So for those of you who are not aware, when you buy somebody's keys, you get access to a sort of private chat room where the people who are chatting can't see each other's messages, but the person whose keys they're buying, they can see, everyone can see their messages to everybody. So sort of a one way kind of channel, like almost like a telegram channel that you can just blast out updates. The feature itself is a little bit half baked, right? It's a bit simplistic. It's like it doesn't quite have a great affordance, I think, but it's something that is not just money. Number go up, number go down. And I think most of these other applications, they're just not as sharable, and they don't have the same, like, reason to keep opening back up the app if you don't just want to obsessively check the prices. And this, I think, is another element that they figured out that even though the chat interface itself is like a little janky and it is not quite fully, I think, where it should be in terms of tapping into a real social instinct, it still, I think, actually puts it significantly, makes it significantly more addictive than a pure financial app. Especially because for a lot of people, you know, for Robert, if you have a big following, you sign up and people are buying your keys and you're getting this instant positive feedback. Most people, when they sign up, they're not getting that instant positive feedback, right, but you, you buy, you buy someone's keys, you start chatting with them, they're chatting back at you, and all of a sudden there is something that is engaging you in this app and pulling you closer into the ecosystem, something you can share online that's not just, hey, I made money today, but oh, I had this like fun chat with this like this super celebrity who I, who I bought their keys that I think has been a real, that I feel like is a real product insight as well that they managed to latch onto, even if it's still relatively underbaked as a feature of the product."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "I think the thing that gets me excited about it is it's not hard to see how that mechanic and just the experience expands into more complex, involved things. And so one thing that I did in my room was like, I was like, hey, answer this question and I'll airdrop this nft. I'll send this NFT to one of you. And the way I did it is people just replied and they send their ens address and then I picked one of them and I send it. But like that, adding that feature to this app because you already have everyone's addresses, because you already have this chat room with everyone where you can see everyone, it's like, that's not a hugely complex feature to add, which is like, show all your nfts, pick one and airdrop it to someone in the room and do it randomly in a provable way like that. I think is what we're going to see next from the team is like they're going to start adding more functionality and they're going to start saying, oh, we started with this really simple experience, but now here's all these other things that you can start to do. And I think the people are going to be surprised or my intuition, I don't have any visibility really, into the full roadmap, but I think my intuition is that people will be surprised at how quickly they're able to iterate on that experience because of the platform that they're building on, because it's just an incredibly powerful platform building on EVM."

        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So Jesse, you were mentioning a lot about the advantage of building on the op stack, the great infrastructure. One of the criticisms that has been levied at base, and I think we've reiterated some of that criticism on the show, is the fact that right now op stack has no fraud proofs, which effectively means that op stack, if you guys so chose, you guys being Coinbase or whatever, the operator of the l two, if they so chose, you could essentially modify the chain without having anybody able to intercede and actually say, hey, you actually broke some validity rules of the chain. Here's the proof. How do you guys think about that internally at Coinbase, there's been this broad criticism. I think it's died down now that there's something to do on the blockchain. But last week I think we were mostly writing think pieces. Yeah, exactly. When there's less to do, people are just like, they find ways to take potshots, uh, including on the show. What I just wanted to give you, um, an opportunity to respond, and especially because we've also levied some of that criticism. What's your take on this question of, hey, is it an l two if you, if the fraud proofs don't exist yet? And where is that on your guys roadmap?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, well, first off, like, getting fault proofs live, um, and we call them fault proofs because fraud has a very specific meaning in a bunch of other places. And so fault is a much clearer term for the, the technical thing that's going on here. Um, but getting fault proofs live is like the p zero priority across all of the op stack contributors. And so op Labs is working on it, we're working on it. And I think if you look at the path that we're taking, it's a different path than what other folks have taken, but we feel really excited and confident in it, and we think what it's going to get us to is it's going to get us to a stage two roll up with multiple fault proof implementations faster, even if it taking us a little bit of time to get there for the first one."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Can you define what a layer two or, sorry, what a stage two rollup is?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "E",
        "text": "Yeah, stage two rollup is basically like using Vitalik's terminology of stage zero, stage one, stage two. It's the furthest along in terms of decentralization. And so there's kind of more decentralization. And we think one of the really important characteristics is that you actually have multiple fault proofs running in parallel, which allows you to turn down the level of controllability from an upgrade multisig. And so what we're doing right now is we actually have two fault proof implementations being worked on in parallel. One using op Geth, which is kind of like the existing execution client for the op stack, and then another one using Opref, which is another client that is being built around Reth, which paradigm is building. And in general, the way we built the op stack is such that we're not just gonna have op Geth and Opreth, we're also gonna have op Nethermind and op Aragon and op pretty much every ethereum client, which is going to give us more redundancy. And that's the kind of whole vision of the op stack. It's like, let's build an open source, composable modular framework that really inherits from Ethereum so that we can have as much resiliency from having multiple implementations as possible. It's a little bit slower. We literally spent two years rewriting the whole platform onto this stack with bedrock, but now we think we're going to be able to move a lot faster to get to that ultimate end state. So that's the p zero priority in terms of how we think about this. At Coinbase, we talked a lot about what is the minimum level of decentralization or sufficient decentralization that we felt comfortable launching the network with. And where we netted out was we didn't feel comfortable launching the network if there was going to be one single party that could make kind of these decisions around fault proofs or make these decisions around network upgrades. And so that's the way we've configured the network as well. We're actually going to be talking about this on Thursday. We haven't shared it publicly, but it's all kind of on chain. And basically what we've done is we've said, hey, we need to configure the upgrade keys in such a way that Coinbase is not a single point of failure and doesn't have a single source of control. And we need to configure what's called the challenger keys, which is basically in the absence of the fully on chain fault proofs, who could challenge a proof and revert it. Similarly, there Coinbase is not the only challenger, so there's actually another challenger that could do that from the optimism side. And so both of those structures basically mean that if Coinbase were to submit an invalid, an invalid proof, someone could challenge it and say, hey, like, you actually can't do that. And then if Coinbase were to try and do an upgrade, we couldn't do an upgrade. We are not sufficient to upgrade the chain or upgrade the smart contracts on the l one in order to make some negative change. And we've combined both of those things with a commitment to this thing called the law of chains, which is a very formative doc that we spent basically nine months collaborating on with some folks at optimism. We just opened up for community review, which basically defines what we think about as the neutrality framework for base, for op mainnet, for other op stack chains that says, hey, the block space of these chains has to be equivalent, it has to be open, it has to be permissionless. And we have to protect the users who are running on these chains as the most important priority above anything else, above Coinbase's right to run the chain, to govern the chain, to sequence the chain, protecting users, and that access to open permissionless, homogenous block space is the single most important thing. And so the combination of that decentralization of the upgrade keys, the decentralization of the challenger keys, and the commitment to this law of chains basically put us into a place where we felt comfortable, hey, this is sufficiently decentralized. Where Coinbase couldn't unilaterally make a decision that would violate the law of chains. It would actually require us at least convincing some other large set of people to do that. And so that's kind of what we felt was the starting point. And then from there, there's obviously a lot more work and we think we're going to progress to that work really quickly."

        "text": "Yeah. So what the sequencer can do is basically say, hey, we're not going to accept certain transactions. You can't take money from users. There's no ability for the sequencer to take money from users. Can you reorder the sequence? You can't reorder the sequence once it lands on l one, as long as the sequencers submitting transactions to l one, reordering the sequence would require using the challenger key or using the upgrade keys."

        "text": "A full mev, yeah, I think basically anyone in any l two construction prior to the transactions landing on l one, there's the opportunity for the sequencer to make decisions about ordering. And that's also part of the neutrality framework. And we'll be sharing more about this on Thursday. We're basically making commitments around that, which is like transaction ordering is a free market and it's ordered based on priority fees and time of receipt. And that is kind of like the commitment that we're upholding. And we'll be doing work to make sure that that's transparent and visible. And if that were to be violated, that would actually be a violation of the law of change as well. That would be something that would potentially put us at risk of losing the ability to continue being able to be a sequencer. And so we're very incentivized and very committed to ensuring that we uphold these commitments we're making around neutrality. Because I think at the end of the day, the way we think about base is that it's Internet infrastructure, it's open extension of Ethereum, which has been this incredible gift. I think that we've been given as a world because it is an open platform that puts everyone on a level playing field, that no matter where they are in the world. I think our belief is that that characteristic, the open, permissionless nature of Ethereum, must be extended to layer two if we want to have an open global on chain economy. And so from a kind of like Northstar perspective, obviously we have the northstars around growth. But I think for our mission, which is kind of increasing economic freedom all around the world, that North Star around ensuring this stuff actually remains open and accessible to everyone is equally, if not more important."

So the split that's happening is a smart contract, and it will be directly visible by the whole world of like, oh, these transaction fees are coming in, they're getting split. Here's how the split works. Here's what the mechanics are, here's what flows to who. And I think that is like, no one's done that before, right? This is like totally novel and you have a large public company like Coinbase, really like leading the way in figuring out how this actually works. And I guess the last point I'll make on this is to that point of, no one's done this before. We spent the last nine months giving our best effort to try and figure out how to do this in the best possible way that prioritizes this neutrality commitment that we have, that leans into what we believe is going to enable an open global on chain economy and increase economic freedom globally. But there is no paved road. No one was like, hey, here's the playbook for how you take a large public company and you work with a forward looking on chain Dao and you do a structure that lets you launch an open permissionless blockchain. We have had to make a ton of decisions over the last nine months and we wrote the first version of the law of chains in collaboration with optimism. We picked a bunch of numbers, we made decisions and we think they're good decisions, but they're certainly not perfect. I think we are excited to hear feedback and input from other folks across the ecosystem and we're excited to keep trying to figure out how to do this in the best way possible. We don't have all the answers, we just have what we think are the right intentions to try and do this in a way that feels and looks right."

The integrity and the consistency that you guys have shown in trying to execute on this vision. And I know that it's a hard one. One of the things that I'd like to dig into a little bit more, which you alluded to, is the relationship between base and optimism generally you guys mentioned, okay, theres going to be a revenue split with the sequencer, between some revenue split between Coinbase itself and then the optimism collective. What id like to dig into a little bit more is base. As far as I understand, its basically an off the shelf implementation of the op stack. And the same is true for optimism Mainnet, which is now what they call, I think, the original optimism layer two, before they started creating more little baby optimisms. Sorry, op Mainnet. Op mainnet. How do you think about the relationship between these two chains? Naively, I would assume that they are cannibalistic to each other in the sense that you want great applications to build on base. Op holders want great applications to be built on op Mainet. And there is a certain kind of zero sumness. Now, I know it's also crypto, and so we all kind of labor under this ideology that, well, no, it's not really zero sum and it's all Kumbaya and everyone's happy, but op has a token, Coinbase has a share price. There is a real tug of war that's happening somewhere. How do you think about that? And how should we think about that?"

        "speaker": "E",

And so I think where we're going in the next few years is that these pieces are going to fit more and more together. They're going to kind of be connected and they're going to be one thing. And so I think that that means that, yes, there are definitely components of like, you know, which chunk of the super chain is going to have more or less of the applications. But I think there's also the component of, like, we're all building towards this shared vision where these things work really, really well together. And so that's the starting point. It's like there's not just the competitive nature, there's also the collaborative nature and the vision of building towards something bigger than any one of us in terms of how these things are kind of different or separate. I've been trying to. I think we're all trying to figure out the mental model for this. And the one that I've been kind of excited about recently, or been thinking about more is and a lot of this comes from the law of chains. And the thinking that we've done on that is almost like a federalism model where you have kind of like the national body that is the super chain of all these things that come together. And then you have state bodies or sub region bodies that are the components of that and that are all similarly kind of competitive. Right? Like you could say, like California and New York are competitive, but they're also just different. They're like parts of the whole and they have, so, Jesse, when you're, when."

We're going to make it so that they have a shared bridge, they have shared upgrades, they have shared homogeneous commitments to block space, they have shared commitments to neutrality, and we're going to piece them together through interoperability. And so we're going to basically build bottoms up, a combination of all of these layer twos. That's the vision because we don't think that it can happen on one chain. We think that it has to happen across many of these things because that's how we actually get the throughput. I think if you go back to the original scaling vision of Ethereum, Ethereum's original vision was like, we're going to shard the l one. And then they were like, oh, no, that doesn't really work because we want to have more of a free market. And what we're now saying is like, we're going to do the opposite of that. We're going to build bottoms up and we're going to say, let's start with a bunch of l two s that are disparate, and then let's make a bunch of social and technical commitments that bring them together and actually make them one thing that can scale Ethereum."

And those shards are all going to talk to each other and like you said, be interoperable and so on. But the difference between these shards and the vision you're laying out for the super chain kind of interconnected super highway thing is that each of those shards is. The native token of each of those shards is ether, and the value flows. It's sort of all socialized under a single state. It's like one gigantic superstate. What you're describing is, like you said, more of a federalist system where you have individual sovereigns, you have Kentucky, and you have California, and you have New York, and they each kind of fight with each other, and they fight for resources, and they're united, but they are also. They are sovereign with respect to each other. And in a world where you have all these different chains that are working together in some kind of super state, let's say, no connection to me.

I want to get your guys perspective. What do you think happens? You guys are. I mean, you might own, we own a tiny amount of Coinbase stock. You guys might as well. I don't know. But you certainly probably own a lot more op than you own Coinbase. I'm going to guess. How do you think about the interplay between op Mainnet and base?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "F",
        "text": "So there's a couple of things. First off, I want to state that we have a lot of respect for all of the l two ecosystems. I think they're all actually taking quite different design decisions into which kinds of properties they're preferring. So I think in the polygon case, it's obviously the new token changes things a bit. But I think the idea of having shared ZK resources across many roll ups in a way that amortizes costs for people building, is super important. I think in the arbitrum case, the programming flexibility is higher value in a lot of ways. And you look at things like stylus in op, I think the key seems to be a lot more freedom in choices, like what data availability layer you're going to use, which proofs are you going to deal with? To Jesse's point earlier about the multiple implementation. So in the ideal world, I actually really like all of these different models. I'm actually not like, hey, one of them is actually strictly better than the others. There are actually certain applications where I. You do need ZK all the time. And yeah, you want to lower the proving costs amongst everyone, right? So in the, say, polygon version of this, I don't actually know the Zksync or starkware exactly how the amortization is working. I've only kind of read the Polygon side. It makes a ton of sense to share that cost across different chains. And so I view these kind of collectives, at least from an economic layer, as like unions that are kind of sharing some resource costs amongst them, such that their average cost to a user is a lot lower. The worst case cost could still be bad. That's where the different design decisions come in. Some of them make certain worst cases easier to run into or harder to run into, but they're all trying to go towards some notion of certain types of actions or transactions have lower average case costs within our ecosystem. I think the op one, from the perspective of giving the most flexibility to developers is really interesting. And like I said, I think all of them have different trade offs. I don't think there's a, hey, here's the obvious reason. This one is the best, if that makes sense. I really think they all have a lot of different merits for different types of applications. But I think Op's flexibility is one of the reasons you see so many developers really quickly jumping onto it. I think in Arbitrum's case, they had a lot of consistency properties before Op in terms of how block times were very consistent. Oracle is very consistent. So it was way easier to do defi stuff there in a way that worked better. They end up being all these emergent phenomena trade offs as well. Yeah, I think it's still way too early to say, hey, this is clearly the winning ecosystem that takes over, if that makes sense. I'm not trying to hedge and be."

        "text": "I'll lay this out from my perspective, very simply, had Coinbase used a different foundation to create their chain versus using optimism. And there's a, as of Tuesday TBD sort of sharing relationship between the base sequencer and returning value back to optimism. But just between these two paths, it's clearly better for optimism, for Coinbase to use optimism as opposed to rolling their own thing. Fact. But it's also far, far, far worse than Coinbase saying, we've selected optimism as our canonical chain that we're going to use and integrate into the Coinbase suite. And there is a path where I do think Coinbase could have said, well, we're just going to select optimism and use it, and integrate it and make this the thing that we use and come up with some opportunity for Coinbase to be very involved in that process. This outcome is like, I would say, like 75% down the chart in terms of benefit to optimism."

        "text": "I'm not sure I agree. And this really depends on how you think about optimism. If you think about optimism as that single chain, sure. Yeah, that's the case if we're thinking that zero sum way. But if you think about optimism as the sum of all of these chains and the super chain, I actually think having Coinbase join and lead the way there, which is now being followed. Right. You have zora, you have public goods network, you have evo. Like, how many op stack chains are following the lead of Coinbase doing this? And my intuition, from all my conversations with optimism, optimism is not op mainnet. Optimism is the super chain. That's what optimism is. And that's a shift. It's a shift from where we were a year ago. But that's a very intentional shift driven by the team. Because I think all of us believe that there's something bigger than a single chain, that a single chain can't do it all. And going back to your point, Haseeb, I've been trying to think, like, I kind of shared this federalism mental model. And the way I think these things are ultimately going to play out is if you believe that, if you believe that op mainnet is not optimism, but optimism is all of these things, then you have to think about what is op Mainnet. And my best mental model, I've been trying to figure out, like, what are these things? Is op Mainnet is basically Washington, DC, and maybe base is California, and maybe Zora is like Brooklyn, New York. Right? Like, you know, these are different cultural places. And I think the thing that is going to happen with op Mainnet is in a world where you have many chains that are all part of the super chain, and you have optimism, which is kind of this. The body of all of these things, the place where op lives is the. Like, it's kind of sacred. I like its the place where the governance lives. Its the place where you have the seat of the government. Thats kind of helping define and figure out how all these things interoperate together. And so does DC have an economy? Absolutely. Does it have creativity? Absolutely. But is it all of the economy of the United States? Is it the biggest financial hub? Is it the biggest art hub? No, its not those things because its the government. And so I think that theres like, I think this is what we're going to see happen more as optimism and the super chain becomes more clear, like what this thing actually is. We're basically going to start to see segmentation, where we see different cultures, different products, different applications, find their natural home in the individual component of the super chain that makes the most sense for them."

It does feel to me a little bit like, I think what we might be alighting in this description is the difference between optimism, as you put it, and op token. And Op token is also not the same thing as optimism. And I think from the perspective of an investor in optimism, which we are not, but Robert and Tarun are, there is a real, there are real distinctions to be made between Op captures 100% of the revenue of this chain. It captures 10% of the revenue of this chain, 20% of the revenue of this chain. And there's a certain real politic that emerges when you have to get increasingly granular with, hey, when we have a marginal shift of demand from the chain that we have 10% on to the chain that we have 5% on, that presumably. I mean, again, I don't know, it's obviously very early for these things."

And that's the commitment basis saying we didn't go and say we're going to do this by ourselves. Instead we said we believe at the end of the day, this is going to be bigger than us and we want to help build that thing that's bigger than us. And I think that that's what optimism is saying. I think that that's what Zora is saying. I think that that's what a bunch of these folks are saying. And my intuition is like, we've seen crypto be positive some for the last decade in really new ways. And I think that there's an opportunity for us to build something positive some here that's way bigger than base or op mainnet or any single component of an l two and is actually a super chain that brings a billion people on chain. And so is that a little crazy? Is it optimistic? Yeah. But, like, here we are, we're going to do it."
