So, I mean, think it is, what we think it is is metaverse now, whether it has anything to do with, necessarily, crypto or the blockchain that I actually don't really know.

It may not be this week, maybe, but I mean, look at this. I mean, even in this down market, which we've been in the down market for what, two, three weeks, maybe you could argue the floor is relatively holding. Like the floor of some of these great projects are still holding. I mean, or Daves is up this weekend. Gutter cats is pretty even. So I think it's, again, back to my point last week, it's quality over quantity. Make sure you're in your projects that you believe in long term. This era of quick flipping is slowly dying out or people are catching big ls, which, like I said, for the health of this overall industry is not a bad thing. Right. So, you know, I think that's what's kind of falling off rather than. And that's why you see a dip in transactions is these flips aren't happening as much. These projects are pretty stable, like almost growing still despite a bear market."
