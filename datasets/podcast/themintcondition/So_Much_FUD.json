It's, you know, a 10% drop off from the crazy run we've been on in crypto. And then volume still seems like it's been pretty high. I know you're pulling it up right now. So overall, I'm feeling good. I will say I just don't know what projects to invest in right now. So that's where I'm out of the loop. But, like every. The vibe right now still seems pretty high."

We had, so this was what, Saturday the third or Sunday? Sunday was the third. The highest volume day that we've had since basically February, really, since this big spike at the beginning of February. Right. So volume, if you're looking at this, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. And now we're on the uptrend. And so, you know, maybe coming back down a little the last couple days, but I mean, you're still in the. As of yesterday, you were still in $200 million land. Right. Which is pretty strong volume. Today. Looks like we're going to drop down pretty significantly compared to where we have been. But, I mean, that's massive volume.

Like, do you guys get a ton of, like, bullshit that just comes in your wallet and you put. You hide it? So I assumed it was that. And I look, and there was already offers on it, and it was like, offers of, like, two and a half or. I think it was like two and a half eth each. And I was just like, what the fuck is this? And then I looked into it a little bit more, and I saw that it came from Azuki, and it kind of matched up with the amount of zookeeze I had on a two to one. And. Yeah, so I'm like. So I went back to bed, woke up again, and they were, like, out, like, four eth. And I was having a great day. Like, it's. That started off terrifically. I sold a couple of them around for ETh and was, you know, having a good day, assuming because there was a pump on Azuki's prior to that drop. And."

So, you know, maybe like a pullback to twelve or something. Who knows? And they just. Through the weekend, they just kept going like, the top. Like, I remember saying to my wife, I'm like, oh, look at these six airdrops I just got. They're worth, like, four eth each. I was bragging about that, and by the next day, I was bragging about, like, the value of these three Azuki's that I had left. And they were like, you know, they were at 22, 25 and then I started putting. I'm like, well, I got to put my money where my mouth is because I talk a lot of shit about not, you know, people not selling and holding their bags too long. So I put. I put one on for 30th. It sold, I think, overnight on Saturday night. Woke up Sunday morning, 30, you know, 30 less fees. It was like 28 eth, by the way. It's like two Eth for fees. Terrible."

Like, it's always been the sell before the drop happens. And I think we saw it with apecoin. We saw it with the gutter cat vials, and now we're seeing it with Suzuki. Is that like, these companion drops or these, like, additional items that people are giving out of is actually helping them? Because I think it's becoming such a great marketing tactic like that, you know, that check your wallets live on stage is going to be iconic in my mind. Like, that's something that is going to be played through. People are going to try it again, but it'll always be like Azuki did that. Like, they now have claim to a sick live event telling everybody to check their wallets and everybody there was like, instantly, you know, I think it was like two or three EtH instantly to now run up to the five and a half that we're seeing now."

And, I mean, I guess both projects are around the same age. Yeah, but I think there's just. I think there's this mass appeal for this, you know, leader for, for the anime style leader here. And, like, they're clearly rocking here. I mean, what is the clone X dropped the monolith box. I don't. Haven't heard too much about that. It didn't make a ton of, you know, noise, like seven, but here it is. It's that. Yeah, it is. It's at six and a half. So this is traded. I mean, so, you know, koenigs definitely up there. Yeah."

I think it'll sit between those two barriers leading up to the land sale and I think it'll probably fluctuate between you know 1011 and 1415. It might spike up a little bit right leading or like right when the news of the land sale happens and everybody tries to buy up to it. But I think even then it'll probably just slowly trickle down until the land sale happens and then after the land sale I think we'll probably see our lowest prices just because there isn't what's next already. Like people instantly go to what is next for apecoin after that. So I think, you know, going off it, if you can buy it now, I think you'll see 1415 again. You probably get out there and get back in at 1112 again before the lane sales."

So, like, you know, if it's, it really depends on, I guess, the overall state of the market prior to this land sale, which at the moment, uh, we are, we're hitting a little downslide here. 3200. If, you know, if ETH goes back to 2700, you know, we might see an eight dollar ape coin. And now you're in a different here in a different scenario, I think."

No, sorry. 36,000 ETH traded. So not small potatoes, not, you know, clone X and Mizuki levels. But, but check out this.

But, you know, it's a no brainer until it's not in the sense that, like, I shouldn't have, like, you want to get in so bad at the time and you don't realize what you're doing in terms of your gas prices. And I did. I knew what I was doing. But, you know, you figure that it's going to hold at those prices that most people got in Athenae, and it's not. And so that's when you start to panic a little.

Right, because you're the time for it to alert and get out. You don't get the same type of gas war that you get. Right. And then, and so that, coupled with how the contract was written, because it was meant to be stealth and not, and it's a little more cumbersome contract and takes more gas, you know, that was just a recipe for disaster, which was interesting because then you see, moonbirds, which is another now super high project that was supposed to be a dutch auction, is now changing the way they're going to do their drop because of this. And I think that's an interesting thing to note as well, because quite honestly, their original drop was, oh, dutch auction, two and a half eth. We don't think it's going to sell out there. And they probably didn't at first. And the hype got so big that, that it was very clear it was going to sell out at two and a half eth. So if you left it that way, they would, we would be looking at the same exact thing, you know, next week when they go to mint. And so now they're changing it to a raffle. Sucks for us because I think your, your chances of actually hitting on that are you much lower than if you were actually just playing in a gas war.
