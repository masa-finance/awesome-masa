But this is like the first time where I have zero clue whether it's going to go up down. It reminds me of that clip from my favorite, one of my favorite movies, to quote Wall street, where he's just like, you know, Matthew McConaughey said, I was like, we don't know if it's going to go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles.

But also, don't forget that all of this ape that they're taking in is supposedly going to be locked up for a year. So potentially you have potentially up to like 10% of the total supply locked up in, in ape, you know, so for a year and not be touched. So interesting.

Do you have residual? Say you buy the ape and for whatever reason you don't get the land, or you don't get as much land as ape. You converted and then, like, it tanks and now you're like, you're kind of screwed. Twice. You didn't get the amount you wanted. Plus you've lost significantly on the purchase of the ape. You know what I mean? Like, if ape is $20 today and you buy an amount for, I don't know, six plots of land and you only get two plots of land, and then it goes to $12 the next day.

I bought my first bag of ape as soon as I found out that I was approved, and I think it was like, $14, and I bought six or I bought seven eth worth of ape at that price. Then I once the. Once the KyC stuff came out, that that was the only way you could get in to. I had the same thought you did, Des, where it's like, okay, keys to the castle. It feels like you just hit the moonbird raffle lottery, right? Where it feels like you're one of a smaller amount of people that can actually mint this with the demand, because I went on Twitter and I was shocked at how many people, even apes and mutant PFP people had said that they got shut out from Kyc, blah, blah, blah, this and that. And, you know, there's going to be demand after this. There's probably whales sitting on the sidelines in KYC funds, daos, all this stuff, right? And so then I'm like, okay, maybe I'm gonna go a little harder in this than I thought. So I'm currently sitting on a irresponsible amount of ape, and I actually sold a moonbird today."

And I feel similarly to this, as I did with moonbirds, where it's like you get one swing at these types of mints, and it's like there could be a possibility that between moonbirds and this is, I don't mint anything else for the rest of the year, like at this type of level, you know what I mean? And so I'm set up to take that swing. I think I. I'm very much more concerned that I end up getting wrecked on this play than I did on Moonbird. So just from a supply standpoint, but."

Or maybe it was part of the unreleased deck that, that got moved around. I don't know. I'll look into that. But here's my theory, which is the only way you for sure win and don't get wrecked is if you get a coda. And for those listening who don't know, coda is like the next generation collection from bored apes. But it's. It's by no means a third collection. I think its value is probably going to be second in the line of things. I still think it's going to be bored. Apes, codas, mutants, and then dogs, because, a, there's only 10,000 of them, so half the size of mutants. And then they're. They're kind of like the lore behind it is like they're the creators of this kind of, like, universe."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, thereabouts at 600, if you buy the whole stack, I would get around 15. At 300, you get around 30, which the odds say you would hit around three codas. If you have, it's 10% chance. Right. And so those codas, you know, we've been doing some, like, EV calculations. If you think code is like 15 to 20, then the EV on the land is. Is like four, which if you're minting out at two, then you're okay. Right? Like, I think."

If you can afford more than ten, and I've seen stuff where it says, you know, that there's that test contract that's gone around that says 45 wallet max, 20 per transaction or something. So, you know, they're allowing for that potentially meaning go pile in player code odds and. And see what happens. Now, there's a whole bunch of stuff we don't know. Like, is that an instant reveal? Will I know immediately if I get one or not? Like, I don't know. And if I don't, what happens there? If it's a delayed reveal and all of the land goes, you know, crazy? Because people are trying to buy a potential coda land, and there's a whole lot of unknowns that make me a little uneasy. But my overall thesis is, you don't get mints like this very often, that have the hype, the ability for you to get in at a price that is semi reasonable or at least primary sale from that standpoint. And then the fact that it's two weeks away from moonbirds, I think, adds fuel to the fire, not takes away. Right? Like, there's going to be all this. Hold my beer. Moonbirds. Watch this. You know what I mean? Like, I think there's going to be quite a lot of that. And I think it's going to add fuel to the fire and not take away from it. You know what I mean?"

So I think, you know, I'd have to believe they had more than Moonbirds just because the brand awareness alone, I couldn't imagine that there were 35 sign ups.

And so, you know, my strategy there is, I do want a board ape for sure and would love to have it, but I don't think my entry into it is going to be the land play.

He thinks they're terrible and can't go through a show without him fighting. So that's. But, but there we go. But let's, let's dive into your project here, the DaO dawn. So first of all, let's explain what the project is and then talk a little bit about your specific background."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, absolutely. And while you're on there, click on the white paper tab. That'll kind of help us a little bit on the top left, white paper there. And this is kind of my background is, you know, a serial entrepreneur in scaling organizations. And that's kind of where Dowdon came from, was the challenge for most web two companies of being able to deploy their products in any scalable environment. In web three, both from, you know, obviously a Dao compliance piece, which apecoin and Ape Dao did an amazing job of kind of leading the charge in regards to, like Kyc. Here's how you deploy a Dao. Here's how you do it legally, arguably setting the stage with one of the biggest brands in the world to try and do that. And obviously, we kind of see it now where there's a ton of interest now more than ever for organizations to bring their products into web three. We saw that even with moonbirds, right, you can assemble a great team, great devs, great marketers, but most companies projects don't have that. And so Dowdon is meant to be an onboarder for them, giving them the ability to have access to our legal teams, art teams, dev teams that can take their vision and build it in a way that people would want to interact with it and participate and ideally be a part of the community that we want to do that. And that's kind of where the idea came from, is not having these brands launch individually on their own, but putting them under kind of one umbrella that would allow the user to have participation in an ecosystem which I think better aligns long term for something that's scalable to, to the community. You can see kind of there, our mint is worth 6% to the team, 94% to the treasury, and so very much like a proof collective type of thing where the team isn't taking some huge amount of funds over the top. It's, it really goes to build long term the development of what we're doing. So kind of start off with that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's interesting. So I'm looking here, and what I think is interesting about this is you have your I, your kind of stage one, which is the Dowdon NFT, and then your stage two, which is the launcher. Can you kind of walk through, you know, what the different stages of this project look like? And I know there's, you know, you kind of have a partner as a starter starting point of this project. Walk people through what that looks like."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. So, you know, this, the game starts when you can enter the pub, which is kind of the place that, you know, that Don conducts business. And that's, you know, our discord is a gated discord. It's going to be locked after mint. And that really is to kind of build this inclusive environment of people that are really in tune. And so minting an access card kind of gives you access into the community, but you're going to have to continually stake it and upgrade it in order to constantly advance, you could say, deeper into the pub and unlock the ability to participate in a wide variety of collections and projects that are kind of coming underneath it. So already, by just being in the pub, you get access to exclusive airdrops, there's giveaways, there's community events, you know, all of those things. But we didn't want to mint an access card that had different rarity traits. We wanted to create, you know, kind of a larger collection that had a lower mint price. And, you know, you could really reward those that continue to play and participate. And that's where this idea came of staking your card and working your way kind of from a basic credit card all the way up to a black card. Right. And what are the perks that come with, you know, constantly participating? And that's kind of where it is, is, you know, person will start, they'll mint their card, they'll gain access to the pub. We have tons of tools in there. Nancy AI, a lot of analytics that a lot of these kind of curated traders would like to see. But also, you know, as you stake your card and eventually burn it, the 7777 cards are never going to increase in quantity. They're only going to get diverse and rare. And so what you're eventually going to see is a percentage of them that are still gen one cards, a percentage that is first edition, a percentage that is second edition, third and fourth. And so that's really where the launcher comes in, because depending on how many access cards you have, some of them are one for one whitelist spots with the collections underneath us. One of the first one being a timeshare company that's deploying an RTU token. So you'll be able to stake an NFT and earn a timeshare point. Those of you who bought timeshares before, they're usually tens of thousands of dollars upfront. They cost a fortune. This is something that is a lower barrier. You will actually, you know, at some point have to KYC and be able to do some of these things that even ape Dow is doing where, hey, we can give you this, you know, token, but when you want to use it, right, when you want to redeem it for its true value, you're going to have to KYC, because obviously at some point we have to collect the you know, identifier information for the wallet that's spending that money. And so that's just one of the collections that are kind of coming underneath Dowdon, that it's kind of part of that launcher where staking and upgrading your card unlocks the ability to participate in these. Some of them will require KYC, which honestly, six months ago was when I told somebody for the first time they would have to KYC for an NFT. They were like, absolutely not. No one's going to do it, man. And we look now just kind of from your conversation, right, where there's going to be a player that does and they feel the value is necessary, and then there's going to be a person that says, you know what, it's not for me. Maybe I just want to get off secondary. And so I think, you know, there's going to be a person that stakes and upgrades their card, burns it, but doesn't necessarily meant the underlying collection. But they want to keep their card upgraded because they don't want to miss out on a future drop. And maybe they don't want a KYC for Majestic, but they'll pick it up off secondary or they're going to sell their upgraded card because, you know, Des doesn't want to mint it, but you do, right? And you'll pick up that card and burn it because you'll KYC and use it. So I think the mechanism of getting people to participate and constantly upgrade is really what's going to reinforce kind of participation in the ecosystem. And that's the launcher plays. You know, the access pass gives you the ability to participate."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's interesting. So essentially the way, just to make sure I understand, you've got your, the access pass and then you've got the launcher. And the access pass really serves as your, you know, token into the community, your access into your discord and all that comes with that. And then your launcher is your partnership, programs and collections that are going to be essentially launched with your technology through, through the Dowdon ecosystem. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. So we do everything for our partners. You know, we, most of our legal teams are shortly jared on resources. So, you know, walking through their tax compliance, our dev teams, our art team. So, you know, when it comes to, like, majestic, which, you know, will have a unique NFT collection, you know, our team, Rob Netterhorst and, you know, it's from Hollywood. That's an amazing VFX animator. And our other artists, we build all of that for them. We help them recruit the resources for their discord build out to their community. And so it really is not a, it's a really hand in hand type of relationship versus, you know, hey, this is just kind of a collaborative partner. We got you some whitelists. You know, the idea is that, you know, there's intrinsic trust of the partners that launch with us because they're vetted and built by our team."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's interesting. And what I, when I originally had talked to you about the project, the thing that stuck out to me just for you to maybe educate listeners who don't know why this is so the KYC piece is so important, I think you speak on this really well. So when you're talking about majestic, right, and what the project part of the majestic partnership looks like, and you talk about the ability to have, or the need to have to KYC, can you kind of walk through that process of why that's so important and what as specifically as it relates to kind of how daos can, can use funds for the real world? I think you speak on that really well and I bet you a lot of people don't know that. So if you want to talk to that, that'd be great."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah. The biggest challenges tokens have is not being deemed a security. That's the biggest problem that daos have right now is even if you drop a token, there are rules about how you have to do it. If you're going to raise money for it, it has to go through a credit investor. And then if you're going to, quote unquote, give it away as a free and fair claim, which is what apes did and a lot of other projects are doing that can get your token into the hand of people who would maybe want to spend it if you have a brand. However, the second somebody wants to spend any type of token, technically, right now only Ethereum and BTC are viewed as non securities by the SEC. So technically, any other token that's compensated should be going through a KYC mechanism. Now, we don't follow that, but those projects that are trying to work within real life establishments, for instance, apedao, they understand that there's two things that really matter when you talk about regulatory and that's Amlaev and KYC. Kyc is a form of fulfilling your AML. And what that is is anti money laundering. It's being able to know who has the token and who's spending it. Right. One of the biggest fears they have is millions of dollars are going to come into ape. It's going to make all this money and no one's going to know where it is. KYC know your client laws allows somebody exactly to say, hey, if you want to spend this, before you can do it, you have to agree to this interface that allows us to identify you. Usually this means, you know, submitting a portion of your passport or id verification information. Once this is done, when that money and funds get spent, ape or Yougo, whoever has it, can then submit that documentation and say, hey, we did collect all of this money, but here's who it was from, not here's the wallets that gave us to it. That gave it to us. Because wallets are anonymous, right? We don't know who's behind this. And you're not allowed to simply just say, hey, we got $50 million from a bunch of anonymous people. And so the biggest things that Daos had to do, and really just now is coming, is following this process that had yet to be defined to not only get a token in the hands of their people that would want to spend it and have that be given to them in a compliant manner, but also give them a way that people could actually transact with that. Because we all know that, you know, if you can't spend ape token or whatever that token is for whatever good, whether it's dinner, and companies can't receive it, right? You know, I can't. That's one of the biggest problems. They can't receive the money because there's no way for them to identify the funds and companies. It's the same reason car dealerships, you can't walk in there and say, hey, you know, I got $150,000 in a bag of cash. I want to buy that car. They're going to ask you, well, hey, can you prove where you got that cash? Right? They're not going to sell, because one of the biggest things these companies know is that people will move large amounts of money through these kinds of backdoors. And AML and KYC is kind of the way to make sure that that can't happen. And it's pretty much stated pretty solidly that unless your organization is doing a KYC when it's spending these, it runs into severe risk of being deemed a security and being shut down. Which is why I think you see now more than ever this talk of KYC, which has been around for anyone who's bought enough Coinbase or moonpay, we almost always, at least all of us have a KYC wallet in some way, shape or form. But we've never, we've never been gated behind participation. Once we were in the ecosystem, it was like, hey, once you got your money into Coinbase and it went to your metamask, you don't have to kyc anymore. Now we're saying that that's not necessarily the case, that some NFTs, and I think we're going to see this more and more, are going to have these in real life experiences or claimable merch or assets that are going to require kind of that little bit of doxxing on behalf of, with the consumer. So I don't know if that answers your question there, but it's purely for regulatory and compliance."

And I think it's probably a bad thing that they're not. Right?"

Like Daos, you know, had been around by like Makerdao for a few years and then Wyoming created kind of their own stuff in August. And, you know, it really is depending on what you want to do, whether it's in the us art side of it. And so I think we're just at this point now where the market is mature enough and there's enough guidance that you can now begin to figure it out. I think we're just at that perfect time of where regulatory is not meeting crypto. I don't think that we could even be in this position like a year and a half ago, there just wasn't enough headway done in this space. Nor was there any template like ape that where you have a $4 billion brand that drops a dow, you can pretty much be sure that they did their due diligence legally, you know, and you can easily, you know, I think now that that template is out there, you're going to see a lot of people begin to use that in really creative ways to drive value back to their community, which is ultimately what a dao should do, right? Is it should, you know, reinforce the value to its holders, introduce new ecosystems in the form of partnerships. And that ultimately will drive the value of your community, which influences your dao token and, you know, board. Ape is a perfect example of that. I mean, I know they're figuring out staking and stuff. But as far as getting their tokens in the hand of their consumers, giving them things to spend it on, providing a way, you know, I wouldn't say easy because I know there were some bumps on the KYC based on the vendor, but actually making it so that now we're at a point where people are going to be buying land with this token that you're not minting on Eth. You know what I'm saying? That's crazy. And how much down the road are we going to see daos and their projects drop their own collections off, their own native tokens? I think that's something that really begins to change there."

What, tell us about, a little bit about the details of the mint. So you mentioned seven. Seven, seven. Very, very Vegas of you.

I know, luckily is our whitelist has 24 hours to mint so I don't anticipate there being a gas war at all unless somebody really wants to have their access card and get it staked right away. So minting will go live on the 30th, public mint on the first and staking is live at time of mint. So this isn't, this is, you know, we didn't want, I didn't want the upgrading process of the card to come down later on. So we really focused on making that available at time of mint. I can tell you that we have a bunch of cool artists and stuff planned along the roadmap. So once, you know, mint goes live, we'll start minting people to start upgrading. I would anticipate that probably four or five days after mint we'll lock the discord and that's kind of when we'll really start getting to the nitty gritty and show our community what's going on. And I, you know, if you don't have whitelist already, we have events tonight, tomorrow, Friday we have a wine Wednesday event that usually has over 100 plus people. We do wallet audits, we do whale analysis. You know, we look at how people are trading and really try and educate the community on, you know, all of these different things that, you know, normally, you know, people don't go into. And so I'd say if you're interested, you know, come in, we'll take, you know, you can possibly earn a whitelist spot, but we've been very, very due diligent to make sure we keep bots out and keep people that we're just going to fill up whitelist spots and not really contribute.
