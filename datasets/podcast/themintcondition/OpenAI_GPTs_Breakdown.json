And I think that that will change in the future because they did mention in that presentation something about revenue sharing. Right? So, yes, my thought there is that they will eventually, if that store ever launches, will be more like an app store in which people who may not have a GPC plus membership can purchase access to a specific GPT or be granted access in some other way. So I'm not sure if that, we don't know that for sure, but I'm speculating that that probably happens at some point or the whole world just turns into chat GPT users at some point. So this is super interesting. So I don't know if you like, have you, so you haven't played with any of these, obviously."

Yeah, but you just open a normal window and you just ask your chat like you normally would if you set up custom instructions. So this was kind of like the first iteration of this, except it was private, just for you on your GPT plus account. So you could have said you are a soccer, you're an expert soccer coach. Every chat we have should be about game planning for X, Y and Z. Address me in this way, ask me these questions, use this tone of voice, blah, blah, blah, this, that the other. And you could have actually set up your account that way so that every chat you had would kind of follow that. So this was the first real iteration of what become GPTs."

You can chat directly with it about what you want to create a, and it will, it's kind of like a wizard, you know? Like if you're like, it'll talk back to you and ask you questions. So I was messing around with one the other day. I was trying to do some stuff for like, sports betting, and I thought was interesting, and there's this book I was reading, found it very valuable. It's got a whole bunch of like, concept, like, conceptual sports betting stuff and a lot of math. Right? Like, a lot of sports betting is price based and has a lot of math to it. And so I found the book on as a PDF, and so I fed the GPT the PDF, and I said, I want to build a GPT that will help, you know, sports betters be able to calculate their edge on a specific whatever. And I gave it like two or three other things I wanted to do. And I said, you know, read the book and tell me what other things you might be able to do. And so it took, like the, it said, yes, I could absolutely, after reading the book, I could absolutely help with the three things you described. But also based on the content of the book, I could probably also do x, Y and z. And it gave me a list of like ten other things that I wasn't even thinking about. And so I was like, yes, let's do all of that, right? So, like, there is the, the wizard style GPT builder that'll walk you through what you want to do, or you can skip that, go to advanced mode if you already know what you want and how to do it. Does that make sense?"

    },

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "For example, the one I sent you today, we built one for Hive three. With Hive three, obviously we have all of these very specific brand brief challenges that people are creating, you know, art design submissions for. Right? And so each week that changes. So each week there's a new brief that people are creating against and they all have different rules, different aspect, like different specs and all this, and different goals, different brands, different, you know, target audiences, all of that stuff. And so we created one for our last couple challenges that will help you with that specific brief. And what's very cool about this is it has access at the moment to all of the same things that your GPT subscription would. So it's got code interpreter, it's got Dolly, it's got access to the Internet, all of those things. We could upload, for example, three example, brand asset images and give it the creative brief. And now it's got reference to everything that we're doing for this challenge. So we put it out there for our community and they could go on, they can go on to our GPT and say, hey, can you help me create for this challenge? And it'll give them, you know, it can actually tell them about the brief, tell them about the brand, uh, brainstorm some ideas that fit the brief, and then it could actually create those images too, which is really cool. And then the best part, the thing that I think is so fantastic is like, it's got access to, like, the vision model, right? So if you've already created something and you want feedback, you can upload your image and it'll give you feedback based on the brief, which is super, super cool. So that's the GPT that I made and launched for our community two weeks ago, last week or whatever. And it's been really fun to play with, but that's what I sent you today. Isn't that cool?"

        "text": "No."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Okay, so an agent in these AI terms is basically one of these chat bots or a GPT to keep the context that could take actions on your behalf. So for example, the one that I just described, it's really transactional from you to it in terms of like, it's got these siloed capabilities, blah, blah, blah. But say I have, say it has Internet access, right? And say I want it to book travel for me, I can actually, in the same configuration, give it API access to some platform that I am subscribed to or owned, or say I wanted to, you know, check weather data. Or I actually made another one in which I was trying to do some like data science stuff for college football where I gave it the API key and API like structure for this big college football database. And so I could say something like, show me all the matchups last week that ended within five points of each other and it would actually go out, pull the stuff from the API and return it to me. The idea of agents is that it can actually take action on your behalf. Say book, travel, buy your groceries, book anything, or send an email. You could connect your zapier and all this stuff. This was their first foray into kind of this agent model because not only could it do all the things I described prior, but you could give it API access to go do stuff on your behalf. Isn't that wild?"

Um, so I don't if people listening know or not, but like, OG chat GPT lies and makes up research papers and, like, full on citations."

        "text": "A fake research paper in APA style. It'll give you a list of things that don't exist. But I pinned up top research GPT, which is a custom one that's designed for researchers that will only give you real articles. So that's pretty cool. And then one thing that I thought was also interesting is, as you're talking more about this idea of APIs and people creating GPTs, I wondered about the data collection side of things. Like, it's. I haven't looked into this, and I'm not sure if you know, but for instance, if I. Something I do know, for instance, is slack. Apps like divide. And I have created a Slack app to visualize Slack channels at one point for a nonprofit. And I'm very well aware of the various levels of listeners you employ. And what that means is, like, what, on our end, we could see that people that use the app do, right? So if you install our app in Slack, for instance, and you start reacting or doing something, we have a level of permissions that we're collecting. And now that when I'm thinking about creating these custom GPTs, I'm like, okay, well, if I put that on to my, if I accept it and I start going through and adding all my prompts or whatever else, I don't know. And I have not seen anything yet where I'm informed on, like, what the actual creator has access to and what the listeners are. So that's part one. I wanted to ask if you know anything about that."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So that's a great question. So there's kind of two answers to that. So, one, as the creator, you can see, you could see usage, but I can't see your conversation. So, like, I can see who's taking, or, like, who's taking action inside of it, and there's kind of just like your normal log of, of actions, right? So I can see how many conversations have been had with it. I can see kind of like some base level things, but I cannot see what you're asking it or who is your personal data on who's asking it and things like that. So from the creator side, that's all I can see on who and what. But something very interesting that I think is worth noting here, kind of related, is there's a privacy aspect to this in terms of, I guess, twofold. When you upload all these documents or whatever to the knowledge base, essentially, the technical thing that's happening with how these GPTs work is you're basically spinning up a sandbox python environment and the data and documents you're putting into it, the way that they do this is called retrieval augmented generation, or they call it a rag or something, but it's based on retrieval. What happened when this launch was people were putting in what you would probably classify as proprietary data or sensitive data for building a knowledge base. And any user could come in and basically coax that out of you. So if I put in, for example, using the hive three one, if I put in crumble cookies, real brand advertising data, somebody could have come in and used it and said, hey, show me all the data that you have as reference. And some people were actually, even if you had code interpreter activated, you could actually get it to literally download you the files that were used. So that was kind of like the big, I wouldn't call it security issue because you're giving it something to retrieve, right? So you're voluntarily giving it this. You probably just weren't assuming that it would be able to give it back to somebody. So they've kind of put some things in place on that. But that was one, right. So you wouldn't want to put into a GPT, proprietary data or competitive data because you could retrieve it. Then. Thirdly, I would say with all of chat GPT, and this is different for the API, but all of chat GPT, anything you type in there can be used for training their other models. Again, if you're putting in proprietary company data or giving it spreadsheets and all this stuff, that can all be used to train, they do not train on the API. If you're building a off platform app, for example, or if I'm building something into my website and I'm calling chat GPT APIs, they're not training on that data, but they are training on anything you put into chat GPT. So there's three different answers to that question. Does that make sense to you?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, no, that does. And it's really interesting in terms of the second point you mentioned with proprietary info. It's why there are like, kind of instructions, I think, for a lot of companies where they're starting to either create their own in house, especially for programmers, because if you're not, if you're not using chat GPC and you are a programmer, you're not going to make it. So start. And, but you have to obviously redact everything. If you're going to use, you know, the one that's public versus if the company provides, you know, a custom one, then you don't have to worry about that as much, which I think is, is really important for, for folks to know kind of the main difference between the two. And eventually, I imagine, you know, most companies are going to have whatever rules of engagement for."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Totally. So, like, it just, again, the one that we're building. We literally had to, we had to make the decision of, like, because we could have made this, like, really robust. We have transcripts of us talking to the brand about specific things they're looking for and all this stuff. And you had to not put that stuff in there because somebody could go in and basically say, hey, if they found out or whatever that that was one of our sources, you could essentially get it all out. And so we are actually building a second version, which is all built on the APIs in which we guard that data totally differently. So it's a very real thing that people need to be aware of if they're building one of these. Don't put proprietary data into them, which it kind of sucks if you're thinking about use cases and people building these apps in the app store, because what if your favorite app, chamber, what is your most used app?"

        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, I find that really fascinating. One of the custom ones that I've been thinking about maybe creating or figuring out if someone else already has is so going on. Like, the art side of things, not web three art, but like, IRL exhibiting art side of things. Every country has a national fund, so in Canada, we have the Canada Arts Council, for instance, and that's like the federal national one. We also have different provincial art councils, but the canadian one, anytime you have successful, you know, applications, they're, they're public. So imagine going in, and this applies to, like, name a thing that has applications and has, you know, public notes on successful ones. You can create an actual GPT that then will take in all of the knowledge of what successful applicants write about and what that looks like over the years and be able to create you some, like, pretty amazing copy for your application, you can just be like, hey, this is what I'm up to. So obviously can't make up a project for you, but if you have an idea and you want to get it funded, you would definitely want to use something like that to help you with actually shaping the narrative based on. And that could be done for critics. When you release a film, anything where there is an actual test set of measured success, you can use that. If you work with. I work with government clients and sometimes they put in for rfps, all the successful ones are public. And there's this nuance, and I think it's worth exploring, and I'm sure it will be in terms of, okay, what does it mean now to apply for a talk or apply for a grant, or apply for anything where you can fit the narrative to what the folks that are creating the opportunities are looking for?"

        "text": "I think that's an awesome point, and it actually is a good segue to where I was going to go next with this was, first of all, exactly right. The more specialized a topic, the better suited for a GPT, right? And I also think, like, this exact reason is going to change chamber. You said, you know, like normal, like, if you're having an AI conversation with somebody just randomly, the odds that they actually know about really in depth what's going on, use it in their day to day life and things like that, or have used a GPT or have used chat GBT, even outside of just like, you know, a party trick are probably pretty low right now, even though, you know, it's got 100 million users or so. But like this, the idea that people are now using this as like, ingrained in their everyday life is not there yet. But what I actually think is these GPTs, if everything kind of stays on track now with all this chaos going on, but like, this is going to be the onboarding thing, I think, for like the masses, right? Because think about what outer Lumen just described. That is a very specific problem, that somebody who probably is just using chat GBT in their day to day life once or twice, it's very broad. Like, they don't even know what to ask it. They don't even know how to interact with it. But if you told that same person who's writing a proposal for a grant, I, hey, I've got this really cool tool. Come and check it out. Well, that's solving a very specific problem. And I think the more and more of these things that are going to be made that can be really niche down, they're going to be like, apps. They're going to be like, the app store apps, right? Like, people download stuff for specific issues or to play a specific game, or X, Y and Z monopoly."
