Oh, I need that, whatever that is. Give me that. Specialized blood pooling system that allows them to rotate their heads extensively without cutting off blood flow to the brain. Wow.

They're getting very rare. The habitat. Deforestation is a problem. There's not enough old growth trees anymore to maintain the owl population in British Columbia. So it only takes one. You see an owl, it's a message. You got to read your horoscope. I want you to go to a chinese place and get those fortune cookies. Backyard, it's, you know, I even see a rabbit.

So I appreciate a cap on that. So with the show title thing, at first it was a honest mistake. Where I woke up, information wasn't super clear. Revoked cache wasn't working. And actually I put it in the title initially because truthfully, to your point, that bunch you made, the first thing I did in the morning was try to go to revoke cash. When I said that, when I saw what happened, to make sure I revoked all my ledger permissions and the front end was down. So we're like, oh, okay, revoke got hacked. Revoke got hacked as well. So that was the title we had for a while. And, yeah, then Revoke caf shows up and by then we were well aware we just hadn't changed the title. And I kind of kept it in there, like, and this is probably terrible, but like, honestly, my thought was like, people are going to try to go to revoke cash. So we probably want anybody who's lazy and just sees the title not to go there because the product is really good and, like, worked really well. And it's literally the first place I went.

Everything is fine. And then we're like, okay, we'll put a piece of drywall in, make it all official, and then rewire it back. So we rewire it back. No power, no furnace. Like, we had to give it up overnight. And then this is yesterday morning, we come back and we're like, we have to fix this. It's like five degrees celsius in here. It's terrible. Anyways, here's the alpha. We're like, we should call somebody. I'm like. And we're like, no, we're not calling anybody. This is ridiculous. We'll chat GPT it. So the alpha is, before you call any kind of professional, make sure you chat to your problem because it totally was like, are you trying out the thermostat reconnection?

And in this world of crypto, where we're our own banks and a lot of people don't fully appreciate that. Even the safes we use now are kind of against us at this point. And I just wanted to talk to you and get a better grip and maybe provide some tips or some advice on how to be safe. We should all be kind of reviewing our safety protocols, our OPSEC, and just kind of wanted to pick your brain that way."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, 100%. I think the problem is that a lot of people don't take security into consideration until it's too late. The other issue is that nobody does web two before they do web three when it comes to security. I'll give you a couple of examples of that. We're expecting people to come into the space and to be their own banks to self custody, let alone they don't know how to manage their own passwords, they don't know how to keep their keys safe, let alone have an antivirus. These are things that are normal to us. But when you're onboarding somebody into crypto and you're not even mentioning security, forget Wallagard, you're not even a mentioning the fact of keeping their eyes peeled and staying vigilant. You're doing them a disservice. They are scraping money together to come into crypto and the last thing you want is a phone call the day after telling you, hey, I thought it was a free mint. Where are all my nfTs? Or I thought OpenSea was openSea.com comma, not OpenSea IO. What happened to my wallet? This is the exact reason why we created wallet guard and I want to give a big shout out to our recently surpassed 65,000 users and over 100,000 wallets protected with wallet guard. We started off the year with a few thousand users and it's insane to see how quickly we have scaled because once people see what it is, it's literally a no brainer. We're not a wallet, we're not an NFT, we're not a token. You don't have to connect to us, you don't have to sign anything, but we're able to bring a security layer to your wallet of choice so that you could stay safe when you are clicking on links. Because that's the point of the Internet."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Is to click on when you say any wallet. If I'm using metamask, we were talking phantom wallets. That would apply to those types of wallets."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Exactly. So no matter what you're using, currently the phishing detection is blockchain agnostic. The transaction simulation supports Ethereum, polygon, arbitrum and optimism, and we're launching support for Binance, smart chain and base soon. We are also working on Solana, but we do support Phantom Wallet for all of their Ethereum transactions and other that they currently added support for. So we are trying to be as blockchain agnostic and wallet agnostic as possible. So this way, no matter what your setup is, you at least know there's a security layer that works."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So if I'm sitting on my computer and I want to use your product, what's the first step?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Yeah, so there's a couple of different things. Everything that I'm going to talk about is actually on our website wallet guard app. So we actually have a few different product solutions. The first one is the browser extension. So if you have Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave Opera, any chromium based browser, the browser extension is our full set package. So you get phishing detection, transaction simulation. We have our security dashboard where you can improve your wallet health, revoke approvals, check your wallet extension updates to be up to date. Everything is in one place. So that's our browser extension. We are also partnered with Metamask. We are one of the launch partners for their Metamask snaps platform. So you can actually enable the security features of Wolliguard directly inside of your metamask. Whether you're using Firefox or chrome or whatever the case is. Mobile support for that is also coming soon. So the concept of this is instead of just seeing a gas fee, whenever you're doing a swap, a claim, a mint, any sort of transaction, it's actually breaking down everything in plain English. You see exactly what you're sending, you see exactly what you're receiving. You're going to know if you're interacting with a bad contract or a bad address and a full breakdown on your transaction so that you can browse and confidently hit confirm instead of wondering, oh my God, what is this about to do to my wallet?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "That is a big fear, the more I think about it. A lot of us probably interacted with different sites that connect to our metamask or connect to our phantom wallets, and we honestly probably have too much exposure when we're clicking on these things. So, like you said, we don't think about it until it happens, thankfully. The silver lining, I would say around yesterday that it's such a big deal that so many people get reminded of it. So hopefully we're seeing a good chunk of people kind of add that added layer of security, maybe get better devices. You may have a ledger at home. I know our friend Steve is a big ledger guy. Hopefully he didn't get effect. I don't think he did, but maybe he's now reviewing. Maybe I got to get a different hardware wallet or I got to put additional layers of security to offset some of these issues. I'm guilty. I'm probably one of the biggest culprits of not having enough safety. I appreciate these types of programs and apps that can help me, you know, save me for myself. You know what I mean? Yeah."

    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "I mean, look, here's the thing. Most people just don't care until they get rugged. That's the saddest part. It literally takes seconds to turn on these security layers that I'm talking about. There is no excuse. People should be rugging their own wallets."

        "speaker": "B",

Yep, I'll put that in the show notes as well, so if anybody's listening on the podcasts, they can click on the link there. I promise you it won't be a phishing link. It'll be a link directly to Hollogard app. But, yeah, we'll make sure. Again, I just want to make sure people are hearing this and have the right layers of security when they're playing around in web 3100%."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "I think that it was really a wake up call yesterday because we saw our product in action. Anybody that had wallet guard installed, as soon as that fake model came up, on top of any connect wallet notifications, wallet guard was warning our users, hey, this is something you shouldn't interact with. Now, we're not a whitelist blacklist. We actually built a machine learning model that's able to detect scams and wallet drainers before you even enter websites and connect your wallet and run simulations to be able to provide that layer of security to the user with zero touch and without even having to hold their assets. That's a game changer when it comes down to staying proactive to protect your own assets."

If you were walking around your neighborhood and, you know, and you saw an owl, okay, I don't know where you live, but, you know, a lot of us don't see owls very frequently.

And it's insane how quickly we have scaled over the past year, being able to be as productive as possible in one location together. It really unleashes the power of productivity when you're in the same room with the people you're building with. So as far as owls, I like."

I won't take up too much of your time, Michael. Like I said, we'll have a link to Wolligard app. We just want to make sure everybody is using what happened yesterday as a little bit of a wake up call to add additional layers of security.

When it comes to phishing, detection and detecting recently spun up scam websites, you know, that's, that's all supported. You know, this is the main thing. Like, we're not a whitelist blacklist. We're able to determine threats as soon as they're spun up. You know, like in the. It's the middle of the night and a scammer launches a fake site and drops it in the discord or puts it on a compromised Twitter page. Wild guard's going to protect you.

But, yeah, like, cap was the number one host on super spaces last year, and people were like, where are you? And I searched on co hosts. My daughter asked me this because I showed her captain. She's like, well, surely you must be high on the co host list. Like, my, my twelve year old. And I was like, well, let me look. And it was like, 168. I'm like, all right, well, that's a little bit of a shot at the ego. I don't have to be number one, but 168 seems a little low."

And for me, leaving that 10 seconds early, it does not record me, it sounds like. So it turns out 168 is very high for me, never being there when the space ends. So now I'm going to start sticking around to the space ends and see what it has. But, yeah, I would have been number one on the list and had a nice little, nice little post that would have ran some numbers had I done that.
