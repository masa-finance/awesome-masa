But, uh, throughout our natural, uh, chatting today. So, um. But yes. And, and we have that, like I said, plethora of all those other shows. And this show every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on Twitter spaces at four to five eastern. It was kind of weird doing this show on west coast time. Being on West coast time in general was weird trying to get, you know, a hang of when all of our content was, and I got to say, like, shouts one, to all the people who show up from the west coast to coffee with captain because one, it is super early, but two, it's like, I'm so used to coffee, like, covering the majority of my morning and like, when it ends, it's 10 30, 11:00 or whatever, 1010 15 and it's taken up a lot of my morning. And on the west coast, it was done by, you know, like 738 o'clock. And I was like, wild. I was like, what the hell do I do now? I'm just waking up. Yeah. So it was, it was kind of wild to do all of this content on West coast time. I also, I mean, no, hate to the west coasters, but, like, not my jam for, like, sports scheduling either. I don't like the, you know, 05:00 p.m. starts for primetime games and stuff. So that's pretty terrible. But yeah, I would say that the best time zone is personal preference.

And we will gladly get you up here to chat with us, but chamber anything exciting going on for you in the NFT world since we talked last time. We, you know, we talked Friday, but mostly, I think ces and your, you know, your procedure. Yeah. Dominated. We did not.

Like yesterday when coffee or when captain was doing the football show, he, like, started off talking about how he was kind of looking to make some moves to pick one up and how it was. That was at 4.8, so they kind of touched that area. Somebody said they maybe like four or five at the very least. Now they're. They're back up, but scooped back up a little. So maybe they found.

What they'll do is they'll wait like a month and see where the project is then, and then kind of get back into it, do a little research into it, see if they're on track, if they've added anything to kind of their roadmap or, you know, you know, kind of get a better, a better gauge on what they're doing and then they'll get in there at typically a lower price point. And I thought that was good advice. I thought that was smart."

        "text": "So basically, if you don't get in early, you know, whether it be like just minting it straight up. So say we'll use, we'll use captains for this example. So I didn't get the mint. What this person said is, let's wait you, you know, three, four weeks, let the market kind of dictate the price, and then what'll happen. It takes away the, you know, some of those projects that have a huge, you know, hype behind it and kind of fizzle out. Like, was it hape? I was trying to think of the, some of the, some of the ones that just kind of had a huge, huge, huge mint. And then within a week or two, we're basically done. So basically you're getting rid of all those ones and if they're still around in three, four weeks, you can kind of revisit them, make sure they're still on track for what they said they were going to do and then buy at that point. And then that way the chances of getting scammed are much lower and then getting at a better price are much higher as well. And then you're actually doing a conviction play on a project that you think has some, you know, has some future interesting."

It's, it's a lot of moving parts. I gotta have potatoes and MVP's and captains and it's this other, you know, it's this gamified thing. I've been listening to a lot of Memeland stuff and I feel like I've not comprehended what's happening and it just, in my opinion, seems like a lot. And I know myself if I end up purchasing something, I'm not going to be following it properly, and I'm going to miss something, or I'm going to miss an opportunity on the staking or whatever it is.

Like, you don't want it to turn into, you know, pixel vault, but, you know, you. You want it to have some cohesion. Right. Like, I'm actually impressed with the potatoes floor. It's holding right now at 2.269, which, you know, at the top was, like, three and a half ish. I would say that's pretty good, considering the mint is now done and you need them to stake and stuff. But, like, I was expecting probably a 1.5 ish. What are your thoughts on?"

So, yeah, I think. I think whoever ended up picking up a bunch of those, I think you're not that disappointed with, because, I mean, you were definitely taking a chance that the bottom would just fall right out on those, and they didn't. So I feel. I feel that, you know, pretty confident for those, for the people that are holding currently. So that's good."

Like you mentioned, pixel vault. That's the one that came to mind, which is, I've tried to dig into meme land a little bit. I don't own any, and I'm like, I don't know if I have the energy to invest, which is okay. You could want to participate in some and not others, but when you think about adoption and people coming in, I think it's a really good point. By chamber of, you're listening to these interviews and you're hearing all these different complexities and you're like, I can't explain this or understand this. It's going to turn people off. So I think it's a really good point that he made there that as he was kind of discussing his in and out, because it's easy to miss things and then I've missed deadlines in complicated projects before and it just gets exhausting."

But I get what both of you are saying. What's the right amount? Or maybe the other question is like, how do you define what type of, I guess, collector or slash investor you are? Are you not into any of these types of ecosystems that have these layers to them or what?"

I look at a lot of ones that have at least explainable bite size parts. I don't know, like a proof, an on chain monkey. Those both come to mind immediately, which are complicated, but not so unreasonably complicated that it can't be explained in a, in a relatively easy step. Because I do like the ones that I get to participate in a lot. Like, you don't have to be as sparse as, say, like a bored apes or a doodles, which are a lot more spread out. But I do think that there is, you know, some level of tolerance where you get fatigue over, oh, there's another thing. And I have to do this thing and I have to stake this thing and then go down to this thing and I, it's just, there's so many pieces to it, so it's hard to put your finger on for me, what exactly that level of complexity is. I think if you can't explain it to someone, you know, in a single reasonable, like, five minute conversation, then it's probably a little too much to someone who's in NFTs anyway."

There's, there's, you're, you know, people more like me that are looking for, I would say more of a quick flip, you know, short to medium term. And I don't necessarily want to know all the ins and outs of like a big game, but there's a lot of people out there that want to utilize NFTs in a, in a next level kind of way. And these games, like, I think the same people and the same reason I didn't get into like wolf game. Like Bunch, you, you and dads were big in a wolf game. Like, I was just like, oh, that's like, it's too much for me. I'm like, I got it. I gotta, I gotta shear these things. I gotta buy wolves. I gotta buy, I gotta buy all these things. I got my sheep. But you guys were right into it and, you know, made some money. So there was money to be made and there was like a gamification of it where, you know, people like me, I think, are just looking for, oh, it's a frog picture. Oh, it's a picture. People like it.

So you know what's actually really hysterical about this is I hit up a rigs afterwards and I made sure to tell him every time I saw him put up an emoji, I put up two. So you guys have turned this into a game for people who are competitive. And this is going to be fun. I heard riggs, I heard riggs talking on coffee this morning and talking specifically about how competitive he was. So, you know, there's rumors out there that people are botting their spaces and things like that.

And this is where I started thinking if a project like the potatoes, for example, Memeland, pardon me, comes up with these intricate like ways of being able to reward holders, right? And reward people who are like first, early adopters, I think the problem is you gamify it so much that it gets so complex for a new person to come in. So even if we talk about mass adoption or not even mass adoption, but like bringing in people to be new holders, where do they begin? Right? You have to start the whole story from the beginning, but it gets so like you start rewarding your holders so much that you're almost like, is it worth getting in right now? I mean, I was thinking about going into sub docs, a couple of others as well, v friends as well. But then the rewards are already out. So yes, there might be something coming up later, but I missed the, I miss the train, right? So now I'm kind of the leftover. I feel like the leftover. And I wonder if they're really thinking about it from a how do I start the game again? Or how do I get people to start the game again and still have fun with the journey that everyone else has taken? And that's kind of why gamifying it has, you know, it's a double edged sword. I mean, to Bundy's point of like Riggs and Bundy adopting the whole like double emoji, right? That's an easy thing to get on the train with because everyone can pick up from somewhere where another person has left off. But here it's a bit hard. And of course, we're talking about you having to spend what, ten eth worth or maybe even more at some point in time to kind of get on that train again or catch up. And I think it may get to the point where it's just going to be too expensive to participate sometimes. And I don't know if they've thought about it."

        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I think that's kind of, uh, you know, not even just from what chamber and Steve were saying about it being complex from the jump, but I think your point about when new people are coming in, right? Because if Memeland is doing their job, a year from now, they'll still be kind of onboarding new people into their ecosystem and I think your point about, um, like, how complex is it to get started if I'm so far down, if the project or the game or whatever is so far already down the road is a really important one. Not only even just from, like, how expensive is it, right. Which you made the point of which I think is a good one, but also, like, cost in terms of time, as in, like, how long is it going to take me to actually learn about this ecosystem and feel like I have deep enough knowledge to even spend money inside of it? Which I think is a really good point. Um, it reminds me a lot of when we were all getting into Zed run back in the day. Uh, and Zed was like, you know, it, it had been around for two years. It was super easy to onboard somebody new in the sense that all you had to do was buy a horse and enter a race or breed a horse and you get a new one."

But when you look at, like, all the intricacies of the game, of Zed run and, like, class systems and different breeds and all this stuff, you could have spent, as you could have spent hours and hours and hours and people do, understanding the game and the ecosystem. So I think that's an interesting one to, like, call as an example, because there's a balance of, it's super easy if you're just getting in day one, but you can spend a hours and hours and hours kind of, um, really diving into the ecosystem. It's also, um, another good example from price point. Like, you could buy a, you know, $80 horse or a $3,000 horse, and you'll have a different experience each way. But you can get in either way as casual or, uh, you know, intense as you want. So I think, like, that's how projects should be thinking about it. And I think it's important to your point to, to plan that way. Right? And I. Maybe they do, maybe they don't, but I think it's, I think it's a really, really, really good point. I'd be curious chamber, if you have any thoughts there, because I would imagine that resonated with you."

Because I, what I, you know, what I took from that, from what Bay said is, you know, yeah. Like, I think it's okay that there are certain things that are out of reach for the beginner like, if Memeland is, you know, ten eth to get in and it's a little bit more complex and you really got to be focused in on it, I think that's okay. I think that's really good. I think. But you're, I don't think you're going to utilize that as onboarding new people into NFTs. I think that's for somebody a little bit more seasoned that's going to spend a little bit more money, and that's okay. And that's kind of similar to your point where you're saying Zed run, you have your free races, you have your lower tier races, and then you can spend a couple thousand dollars racing horses also. So I think Zed run's a really good example of the entire."

Right now you have a lot of the newer projects, like the team from Memeland, they're showing up in spaces. They're talking about what's exciting, what's going to happen. But then when you consider it from the idea of a game, essentially, that's what they're creating from all of this, am I going to be able to have that experience again? Am I going to see, I don't mean that the founders have to show up in a space, but it's that communication, that level of communication. Right now, we're getting it in stages, right? So as we're getting it in stages, is it going to happen again? Are they going to start, like, Twitter campaigns again to kind of, like, continue that communication? Or is there going to be some sort of tutorial or manual? Like, this is, I think, something that will help ease that, that burden of, like, expecting the community necessarily to sit there. I mean, of course there may be people, but we're, we're predicting whether those people will still be in the ecosystem or they might be so far ahead that they're just busy with it."

Like they're the. It's the team's responsibility to make sure that that part is. Is easy to understand, easy to get in, easy to onboard and like, yeah, you're going to have awesome community members but you can't rely on that. It's. It's got to be at the team level.

Because on one hand, the points you were made about a calculator is actually really strong, right? I mean, like, I'm a shitty speller and I'm not going with directions and there's gps and there's, you know, spell check. But on the other hand, like, I'm trying to remember who it was. I heard. I heard, like, somebody on a podcast talking about how there's this scary thing. It might've been like, Neil degrasse Tyson or someone about how, like, we're losing the idea of intellectual thought because, like, yes, we have it at our fingertips. But, like, when somebody would say, like, oh, who is that person from that movie? A bunch of people would sit around on a couch until they racked their brain and got the answer. Now everyone just pulls out their phones, and they immediately have the answer. And there's something to be said about, like, are we not, like, working the muscle of our brain enough? But I don't know. Then on the flip side, like, anybody who knows how to use AI properly is actually. It's just like any other tool, like Photoshop or anything else, like, bunch was saying. So this is a really, really complicated one to answer. Cause there's, like, all these layers to it of what you're learning and how you're using it. But, I mean, ultimately, to chambers point, when kids grow up, they're gonna end up using AI for everything they do. So not. So learning how to use it now is like, when people say, get kids off the iPad screen to some degree, because that's the world they're gonna grow up in. So, I don't know, just like, one of those really, really super complicated conversations that's, like, hard to digest as we go through it. It almost makes my head hurt."

So it is a tool. They still need to learn how to do it, but I don't think that that's a tool.

So I. There's. There's places for them, but they can't start out with, I'll just use.

I'm a college professor, so of course I get students that come in and hand in essays. And to me, if I think if it's a tool that they can use to help their writing, then I'm all for it. Actually, I don't. I'd rather just read good stuff than to read some of the crap that comes across my desk sometimes. And as I agree with others, if you are trying to make AI art, it's not easy.

So I tell you kind of how committed I am. I would say my average learning is three to 4 hours a day over the course of every day for the last six, seven months of learning. Trial and error, minus weights, kind of. You can also look in mid journey at the community pictures and see what prompts they're using to get an idea as a start out. But then really, it's just a case of jumping in and finding your style. And I wouldn't even say I've necessarily found like, inverted commas my style, but it's a starting basis for, obviously, the early days. I wanted to get something out while it's still quite rough and ready. AI hasn't worked out fingers and hands and stuff like that. And I fully believe people should still put out those kind of images because they're going to be a big part of history, like the renaissance that's coming through of like, you can laugh about the early images. You'll literally be able to look at an image and go, oh, that was circa 20, 22, 23, because you can see the hands. But yeah, anyone that's not sure about it, I always say before you make a decision, go try it. That's the biggest thing you can do.

Wednesday, four to 05:00 p.m. we'll have a link out shortly for that, but until next time, stay mint."
