Looking to chase, you know, the current meta, you know, whatever the, whatever the soup du jour is. And it's good to take a little bit of a step back and really just kind of survey the land.

I was so excited to get, get in the game like feel the bull market going. And what happened to me there was I over allocated too fast, right. And like that was when the market was like super hot. Everything's on fire. And then what happens is you don't leave yourself enough room when the dips happen, right. Like buy the dips is for a reason, you know what I mean? Like we, I didn't leave myself enough room to come in and I secure myself in the ones I was like confident in. And now that leads you to just be mostly underwater for on like longer term bags.

Like, so the guy that created it kind of. He was at the. At the peak of the presale meta that was happening a week ago or two weeks ago, and everybody piled in, and all of a sudden, he had over $30 million in this presale, and he didn't fully know how to take care of it. And when you have that much money, there's definitely the greater community worries that he'll. He'll just take the money and run, you know? Of course, better people have, you know, I'm saying. So there was a moment there where, you know, people weren't sure if he was just gonna. If he was gonna rug, and I think just got, you know, over his head as far as the amount of dollars he was dealing with."

We had lots of liquidity to drop, and, I mean, we were dealing with much smaller amounts as far as total wallets. That participated, total soul participated. And we were able to do everything properly as far as, like, you know, send, send the token holders there their portion lock the liquidity, burn the liquidity pool tokens. And we were, unfortunately, I think, a little bit early on the presale meta, and then all of a sudden everybody else started going. So there's a lot of similarities between kind of what we did with make it all back and smoke coin, where it was just on a much grander scale. And the gentleman that was spearheading that particular project, I don't think, fully understood the mechanics of a token distribution of that size. Again, I think they had 30,000 wallets participate. $30 million. I think it was $32 million worth of Solana."

So there was a lot of this, like, oh, is he actually trying to do it? Where in fact, it was actually congesting the network. There were some other projects doing the same thing. And now he had locked the liquidity, or he had finally set it up, and then he had these LP tokens that were worth $30 million, and he started asking the community, what should we do with this? I know the original plan was burn everything, but should we keep some? Should we not? And then there was a little bit of backlash there and he finally said, screw it, I'm just going to burn them. And he straight up burnt $32 million worth of LP tokens. And now it's just, it's, you know, it's in the ether now."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I don't know exactly what slurp did. So, like, so you can do a couple of things. So when you, when you create an LP for a particular token, you put in equal parts of whatever the pairing is. So there's, you know, in this case, it was small and Solana, so you put in equal amounts, and then radium or whoever, you know, whoever you're putting that liquidity on gives you LP tokens. It's basically like a receipt that you've pooled these, these two pairs. So you can, you can trade those back in and get that liquidity pool or that liquidity back, depending on a couple of things. You can set your liquidity pool to timeout after 30 days, after 60 days, 90 days a year, a lot of times you'll see liquidity is locked for three months, or liquidity is locked for twelve months. Whenever that time comes up, that becomes available liquidity. And you can exchange your LP tokens for that liquidity back, or you can lock that up again. The real move is to burn. Take those tokens that you get that receipt and essentially light it on fire, send it to a dead wallet, send it to a burn wallet, and it's just locked in perpetuity. You can never get that liquidity back. It's there in the ecosystem forever."

That might be it. That might be it for the pullback. For the short term, I could see us kind of breaking all time high on bitcoin and then retesting the previous all time high, like, retesting that 72 range.

I think the last month or so has been obviously heavy in Solana. Probably more than that. Very heavy Solana, I think last week we saw, in my opinion, was an unorganic base. Push or blast? Push. I forgot what it was. I think it was base to. This is an Ethereum layer two that you can transact on. I know you know that. I'm just saying that for the listeners. But I do think, like, this is a good moment. In time to look at different plays on different blockchains. So, like today I found, you know, I was looking at different, you know, meme coins on base. I was looking at some stuff on blast and just kind of looking at different areas where the market may swing to. I don't think the market has decided where the next kind of big influx of volume is going to come from. So I think it's good to be like, spread out a little bit. I also have some Ethereum, you know, just layer one ethereum projects that I have that are sitting really pretty, that I'm expecting some good things from. So I'm just trying to kind of redistribute some. Some positions into different blockchains and, you know, get accustomed for it. So if the volume does go heavy on one specific thing, you know, there's less of a. Less headwinds as far as like, learning new stuff, how to transact on it, where to go. So I think there's a good time for that kind of thing."

It's beyond where. It's beyond my current capacity of bandwidth. So I'm staying away from that out of nothing else, but just like lack of time. So I haven't really done much of that base also have not been in on yet. However, I'm more intrigued. I feel like in base meme coins and things like that, I'm with you on that one. Just seems like there's good liquidity there for that. I just, I'm like, I'm not interested right now in the like, really active farming. You know what I mean?"

But I think for the most part, I think you're right. I think base seems like the place to be. I also found when I signed, when I switched my metamask over to the base network, I actually had base in there. Like, I had Ethereum base already in there, which I didn't know. I don't know if it was, like, airdrop to me or what, but it was in my wallet, and then I started using that to trade, so I had, like, $1,500, and I'm just. To me, it was free money.

So, like, if there's $20 million market cap, I want to see, like, a million dollars worth of liquidity. This is a $30 million market cap with $500,000 of liquidity. Not ideal. Only 659 holders. Not.

Five to ten x is like a sweet spot where, like, I feel good. Like, oh, I'm like, I'll just wait for the next, you know, the next conviction play, because I don't know. You know, we talk about it in our group chats. But I do feel, I get a feeling when you just start aping everything, yeah, you could win some, you're going to win a few, you're going to lose a lot.

That could be something. And not every play has that gives me that feeling. But more often than not, when I do get that feeling, it usually works out.

It's, let's see, it is maybe two minutes. It is 1 minute and 4 seconds. So a 25% price difference in a minute and a half. Not even a minute and 4 seconds. So what I'm telling you is when you're entering these tokens, well, just, just dumped. But see, but look at, but look at, this is a 1 second chart again. So measure, but measure that. So you've got, again, you've got a, just the dump to recovery. My point is, the entry matters so much more on these tokens than it does on established altcoins, right? Like you're not getting 20% entry swings second by second on established tokens. But it matters here. That just means like literally it matters the second you enter. So as soon as you're hitting that button, you want to be hitting that button on a low point in the, the, in that, you know, 1 second time frame rather than the high point, because you could be right, but you need to be now 25% more right than you were before. Right. You know what I mean? And so, like when you're trading high frequency or highly volatile stuff like this, that really, really, really matters. That's an edge. Like that is a difference in profit or not. Maxwell's getting slaughtered right now. I got the whole run up to the top. So there we go. We got that one. One.

That doesn't mean you hold. That doesn't mean you hold the trade for 1 second. But they are short term trades. You're not trying to enter on a 1 second chart and hold for, you know, long term. If you're holding for, you know, if you plan to hold for a week or a month or whatever, that 1 second does not matter.

So if there was a token, all that to say, if there was a token that embodied that, I would probably purchase it. So, like, that, that's where my line is, like, making fun of somebody that should be made fun of, because this guy was definitely primed to be made fun of.

Because you're in and out. You want to be. You want to be in and out. And so you. You need, like, part of this strategy that I'm implementing is like, you need to be able to DCA, like, a little bit. And if you. If you find yourself in something with no volume, you. You can't get out. Right? Like, you're trapped. So that's why you need a little bit of a volume threshold. This one, definitely, that I just bought, definitely feels like it's going to run, but we'll see. Anyway, the Amari up 55% on it. This is what we're gonna do. We're just gonna live trade during the show from now on."

You can export your keys to your phantom wallet and just trade it, like. And then you have access to the wallet on your phantom. And you can just do everything through bonkbot. It's very, very, very easy. You can manage all your trades through bonkbot. It's really an incredible product that they created. Like, this was bomb by the bonk team."

        "text": "Yes. And so, like, there's no risk of getting sniped, there's no risk of getting rugged. It doesn't actually become a legitimate token with a pool until you get to 69. Until you get to 69k."

So you can actually buy into these pre sales really early and trade out of them even before they ever get there. So if you identify some. And remember, you're talking like it's got to get to 69k. So if you find them really early, you're talking a decent amount of multiples before it ever even hits the radio."

There's a, you know, then a decentralized contract with you can find on deck, screener or wherever, and you can trade it. And so some of these have made it pretty far. Like, the whole point I was trying."

And that came out of pump fun and went to, then they become, they, that's the, that Longboy one with $5 million market cap is the kind of most successful one I've seen since I've been paying attention. They're not, they definitely aren't all like that. But this is super interesting, right? Like, think about, I mean, it's kind of PvP presale. So my point for you is like, man, twofold, one, you got a fun meme. Go make it and see what happens. You know what I mean? You don't need to do all that work of, uh, creating the pool, getting a pre sale done, all of that stuff. You can just go create it here and see if it catches. And if it catches, you know, it makes it out and you're, you're flying then. Right. So I think that's super interesting. And then as well as like, the PvP pre sale, I think is interesting where you can get in on something early and, you know, potentially have multiples before it even gets to the, you know, before it even gets exit velocity."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So I would say the only downside is any, the volume is going to come from people coming to the site and purchasing it on the site. Correct. Until 69."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, exactly. Correct. So, like, you're playing, it's very PvP in that scenario. You're literally playing against folks that but."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "You could buy and sell before it even gets to that point."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Correct. And so I've. I've made a couple multiples on there, and then I've also got there, you know, the risk of buying when you get close to the top is somebody from the bottom dumps on you and it never makes it out. Right. Like, if you're buying close to the top, you're like, okay, this is gonna make it. This is gonna make it out. And then some dude with 8% of the supply just nukes it. Like, you know that it never. So I definitely lost the soul there yesterday trying to play something early that I thought was going to make it out, and it never did. So, you know, those are the. The risks associated with that are, I would, I think, fairly obvious. Right? You're. You are. It's high risk, high reward. But I think it's a. I think it's also super interesting from, like, a launch perspective. Right? Like, you, like, if you chamber, have a great, like, you know, make it all back, you could have kind of tested it here at first or, like, you know, launch a next one where I keep thinking we need me and."
