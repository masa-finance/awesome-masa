That's the precipice. I feel that you could. If they're a quality band, like 50 to 60 years old, you could probably still see them and they're. They sound pretty good still. And then there's a massive drop off. You look at, like, people like Paul McCartney, who's literally changed his voice just to perform. Doesn't sound like the, you know, doesn't sound like he used to. Elton John did the same thing. But, yeah, I feel like 50 to 60 is the range. You could kind of keep watching them and going to concert, and at least the level of talent doesn't drop off drastically.

I like having thrown out twice. GM says shovel. My first explicit album was the chronic. Also frowned upon and thrown out after two weeks. Interesting. So there a couple.

Like, you know, the casino players are going to go where the casino, where the games are happening, and if it ain't in the NFT market, then it's going to be in the shitcoin market or wherever they, you know, can get their fixed.

I think it's a separate thing from nfts, though. Like you'd mentioned, nfts were running in some of these down market cycles. I truly think they're running independently of each other. I don't think the, if nfts are going up, I don't think has an impact necessarily on the price of other shitcoins. But, yeah, I know nfts are definitely down bad.

Like be careful with the actual liquidity that's in any one of these tokens at any one time. Right? Like, you know, you see people out there that have paper gains of a million dollars on a $300 shitcoin buy, but if they went to actually go sell it, it's really only worth like six hundred k. And you're like, yeah, well that's still pretty good, but. Yes, but what it means is there's not as much liquidity as you may think in a lot of these and it can get pulled very quickly. So you know, the TLDR is don't let, don't get caught holding the bag on this stuff. I do want to go down to Tammy and then we'll go to v squared and then we'll change gears a little bit here. Tammy Gm hello."

Because that's everywhere right now in the web three space and it was a warning to degens to be careful because law of gravity is what goes up, what comes down. Right. But I, but what I wanted to comment on and why even came up to speak is the NFT market. So for most of us as artists and even the projects, it is 100% tied to the market because people don't want to spend from their own, you know, banks or their own IRL accounts. They want liquidity to spend in the space. And if it's not happening, sales go down. If it is happening, people buy. I mean, it's just law of nature. Right. So right now, I think what's going on with Pepe is there's going to be a lot of people that make a lot of money, but there's going to be a lot of people that lose a lot of money because they're new and they're fomoing in. And when it reaches a certain point, people are gonna cash out. You know, I mean it's just normal. But those of us that have been here building the artists, the PFP projects, everything else, we will benefit from. What you all make of Pepe. That's my."

        "text": "Yeah, that's a, it's a really good point. I think there's a couple things in there that are interesting that you, you brought up, which is one, I totally agree with the sentiment that like people want to purchase in the space with money that they already have in the space. Right. Like we are. It's funny. We were talking about it. I think it was on coffee with captain yesterday where either yesterday or the day before where there was kind of a question going around from Josh that was like, hey, what would actually, what would actually inspire you to spend fresh money, fresh fiat in the NFT ecosystem? And, you know, it's a good question because I think most people, like you said, Tammy, are playing with money that they already have. And so whether that's, in some cases here, it's tied up in illiquid jpegs, right? So that means they don't have that liquidity. But in other scenarios here, you know, you're going to see a lot of people make a lot of money and then maybe come and sprinkle that love around. But at the same time, maybe those people that are buying from you are unfortunately the late goers to the meme coin party and might end up losing a lot of money. So it's a very interesting dynamic. And I would say, like with this meme coin stuff and just in general, a lot of times the people that are making these ridiculously screenshotty types of amounts of money are the people that are in it super, super early. So by the time you're hearing about it, a lot of times it's too late. And I don't know, would you agree with that chamber and Des, I mean."

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "And so we always, usually see an infusion back into the market after these airdrops, right, because people label it as free money. They get a little loose with it. So, I mean, yeah, it's, it's a proven, it's a proven thing about it. The problem is with shitcoins, unlike airdrops, is people usually get a little bit more wrecked on that. So it probably balance out a little bit more. But, you know, valid point. Valid point. Hey, I think, you know, we talked about adding a little bit more value and knowledge on this and v squared brought it up in the chat and I don't care. I'll ask it. You know, for those who maybe not know what you're talking about as far as slippage, can you give the 15 2nd definition of what slippage is and how it pertains to kind of selling out."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I would say there's kind of two things. One, there's what slippage is, and then there's two is like that liquidity that's actually being provided as a whole. Right? So like slippage is basically the bid versus the distance between the bid versus the ask. And whenever you're swapping on these like token swaps, like uniswap or sushi, there's usually a spread there. And because what you're actually doing is like real time market selling, you're not placing limit orders on most of these tokens, you're subject to that slippage. Right. So it's like where that liquidity is being provided. And you can see there's a lot of these defi things now where you can actually kind of provide liquidity in a very specific price range, which is interesting. So that's part of the cause of that too. So like that's what that slippage is where, you know, you might see a token, you might see your like quote on uniswap be something that ends up being, you know, different. When you go to sign that transaction, it's because there's that spread there and you have to be able to kind of the lower that spread. Like the lower the percentage between the bid and the ask, the more closely you will get to what you actually are seeing on the screen. And sometimes you can't even get a trade in because the spread is so far away and can't be guaranteed. Chamber."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "I was going to say, just to simplify it even more. Imagine you had $10,000 that you're trying in a, in a shitcoin on paper, right? Like you look at your opensea account and that's what it says. But when you go to trade it, say at that price point, say it's a dollar, the price of the NFT of the shitcoin is at a dollar that could only account for maybe a few thousand dollars of that bid. So say at a dollar, there's $2,000 worth of liquidity. So your $10,000 as you sell it, that $2,000 gets eaten up. Well, the next price down, it might be ninety eight cents, and that might only have $1,000 worth of liquidity. So there's $3,000. But now you're not at a dollar at down and down and down until that $10,000 is eaten up. So by the time you get to the bottom, you could be selling more than half of your bag instead of $1 you're selling it at. You've lost nearly 10% of what you thought you were going to get.

Tammy, thank you for bringing that up. I appreciate it. Great point and appreciate you joining us today. Welcome. Anytime. I do want to get to some of the NFT stuff going on, des, I think it's important that we just touch on this. I don't know how, you know, in depth. We want to go, but I think it's worth commenting on. You know, we saw all this stuff happen in the last week or so with Franklin having kind of gotten himself in a sticky situation with trusting an investment, I guess. And the word on the street is about for the tune of like $4 million, 2000 eth. And, you know, yesterday we saw that he kind of deleted his, his whole Twitter. I'd love to get your, your thoughts on it, but before that even, like, it's funny, we were talking about this yesterday in, we're sorry, Monday we had our first, like, Ben Mesrich project movie screenplay writer's room. And it was like an open topic for people to kind of come in and pitch ideas to Ben on. Like, what do you want, what we should be writing the screenplay on for the, for the community and helping out. And the whole story of kind of yuga and bored apes kept being a common theme. And there was, you know, like Franklin, like Ben had been following the Franklin story. And so that became like part of the topic of conversation, which I thought was really interesting. So chamber, you were, you were there in that chat, first of all, what did you think of that chat?"

Yeah. And you're basically given ideas for movies and screenplays and whatnot and you're getting a media feedback. I thought it was amazing. I pitched them an idea that I had and it definitely highlighted someone's journey, kind of the rise and fall of like an NFT person, just like a regular NFT person through the lens of bored ape Yacht club I thought was interesting.

        "text": "Yeah, I mean, it's, I've never met Franklin, nor have I ever really talked to him, but, you know, it's an interesting situation. I think it kind of encapsulates a story that, you know, maybe a little bit more magnified in his scenario, but, you know, a story that probably resonates with a lot of people that have jumped into this space over the last two years. And so, you know, it's interesting. I saw Sugar Shane kind of write his, like, one tweet post about the rise and fall of Franklin, and then Ben jumped in to and commented, you know, I'd love to tell the story. Who do I talk to? And so, I mean, it, it is something that is, like, attention grabbing. I think, personally, for me, it's always funny. I, you know, in the back of my mind, I always thought, like, oh, you know, my similar situation could be a little bit similar to Franklin if some things panned out and if I had held a little bit more and, you know, there was that possibility. But it's just so funny because how that works out and the mental health of, like, fomo and what that is and to see where it went, it just kind of makes you feel grateful for what you do have and the decisions you made. So it's an interesting cautionary tale probably for the last two years."

        "speaker": "A",

Right. And we don't know the whole story there, of course, but he said in a tweet that, you know, he trusted somebody with an investment, ended up not being the case. And so, like, there's that aspect to it. And then there's also the kind of, you know, cautionary tale of, like, when's enough, enough type of thing and, and, like, what that has to, you know, how that takes effect on somebody where it's like you have, he was by, I would say, most everyone's standards, one of the best, if not the best trader in the entire NFT market and history. Right. Like a guy, you know, turned having a bored ape into being able to trust somebody with a 2000 eth investment. Right. Like, but, you know, part of that means at some point you got to manage that risk and take some off the table. And it's, it's so sad to see that happen to somebody who's, you know, again, by all accounts an amazing human being. So it just sucks. But I think it's worth noting. I don't know if it's like having the price impact on apes that people are saying it is. It just looks to me like the whole market is kind of following that direction. So I wouldn't say, you know, that has had some kind of crazy, crazy price impact. I don't know. What do you think about that, Des?"

So I think there's a lot of people that have been waiting for him to fail because, yeah, and that sucks, right? I mean, it's like, it, it kind of represents this whole space that we're in. We all like our Kumbaya, right? But in the background, are we waiting for the ones that are six to fail so that we can say, see, you're on the same level as me.

It makes sense with it being in line with that type of supply. Right? Like, if you're dropping 106,000 posters that are eligible for a mint, you imagine the supply will be that much. So a $20 price point makes a lot more sense than a $200 price point, right?"

I know that's what the community was basically asking for. Interesting that, you know, Nike has a fully kind of built out web three brand with artifact and have chosen to do stuff on the side of. Of that. I would have thought they'd kind of roll it through artifact, but, you know, it's, I don't know, probably so not good for all those that are holding Clodagh. It makes me feel not good."

I invited dank up because I see that one, he's waving at me ferociously down there. But two, I see he's got some dot swoosh in his bio. So if he's. Then it looks like he left. So if he's coming back, we'll get him up because I'm sure he had a comment, but otherwise. Let's throw it too, Timmy."

And there's a lot of Adidas and a lot of Starbucks, a lot of brands coming in. My question is, we know that they are coming in with a way for people to onboard without knowing they are onboarding. Right. They're smart and they're going to do it in a way that is just digital rewards. And people are going to sign up and do a wallet without even knowing they're in this space. My question is, it's going to happen so freaking fast. Okay. We all are talking about it here, but my thing is, is this going to happen so fast? What makes us relevant? The ones that have been here building and making this space, what keeps us relevant? We have to start looking at that. We have to start building together, collaborating. I would love to see artists and PFP projects combining their strengths because I think what's going to happen is so many people are going to be brought into this space from brands that don't even know they're in this space, why would they even look for us? Do you know what I mean?"

I'll throw it back to you in a second because I'm actually curious to hear, like, what you would recommend. And then two, I think part of it is, you know, at least what we're doing with Starbucks, it's super important to us as kind of advisors as well as to Starbucks as a brand, entering the space to do it in an authentic way that includes the people here. Right. So, like, one of the things that we're looking to very specifically do with Starbucks is feature web three artists in the stuff that we're doing. Whether that's, you know, collaborative stamps, whether that's mini journeys, whether that's things like that. We're actually looking to highlight projects and artists in the space. And so I think part of it is on the brands to kind of understand, but it's also up to, I think, the people already here to kind of be loud about brands that aren't doing it in an authentic way. Right. And so that would be my feedback. I'm curious to hear, Timmy, like, what else would you recommend for people that are here with all this stuff going on?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "D",
        "text": "Well, first of all, I would say that I don't think that any brand coming in is not in an authentic way. Right. They. A lot of the brands coming in don't even know what we're doing here. So they are going to come in with whatever they're advised to come into. And so I don't have. I don't blame the brands. I don't blame the people that are meeting up at the brands. I think all of us, all of us that are here, the ones that have been building for the last two years, need to accept that when we say mass adoption, that's all mass adoption. We can't pick and choose. Brands are coming in and so we need to either find a way to collaborate or pair up together to build this, I don't know, this web three like bonding thing that keeps us relevant because I think what is going to happen, and I'm not even gonna like, sugarcoat it, I think that what's gonna happen is there's gonna be a lot of brands coming in, especially from the US. And I think that they are going to onboard all these people and these people aren't going to know what the hell they're doing. They're just coming in and, and doing digital rewards and they have no clue what nfts are or us until later. So we are going to fall to the background. So it is our duty to find a way to stay relevant."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I think that's a great point. And I think there is. I think there is a lot that, you know, these brands either can do or the advisors of the brands to help kind of be, like I said before, authentic to the space. And I think that's important. But I do think you're right in the sense of like, it depends on how a brand is using it, right, where if it's just as a tech in the background, you're right, that's going to happen because it's hundreds of thousands of people that maybe don't know that they're even interacting with blockchain and nfts and those people won't come into the rest of this space and discover what's here. But I think if the brands are thoughtful and careful about it, I think they would allow kind of education and discovery, which I think is what we're trying to do with Starbucks. So I think it's really going to be a case by case basis on how these brands are interacting and being advised. Quite honestly, I do want to throw it over to dank because he waited very patiently. I assume you wanted to chime in about Swoosh. So go ahead. Thanks for joining us."

I'm actually at work right now on my lunch and I'm about to go back on the floor, but I'll keep it short, simple and sweet. I just wanted to comment on whoever was talking about the Clonex and wanting to kind of get, yeah, that guy, there was a comment like where he was saying or something about that community wanting like a pair of these air forces. So I'm not like, I'm not part of the big brass. I'm not, like, in the C suite. But we do have a company blog, so I do get, like, bits and pieces of information about some of this stuff. And what I can tell you is the whole swoosh like program, it's not meant for people like us in the space who are somewhat well versed. This kind of ties into what you guys were already talking about. This is for people who have zero to no experience in web three. And what they're trying to do, like, you guys have been talking about, is make it sort of a seamless transition and something like, they don't feel like they're starting something new. Because the whole premise behind the Dos swoosh, like, the culture is the sneaker culture, right? Like, what they're trying to really, really promote is moving to web three and take that sneaker culture over into web three. So when they. So tomorrow on the sneakers app, I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with it. It's on the Google Play. It's on iOS. It's like their high heat raffle app that you can enter in raffles, and there's a whole, like, social media aspect to it. Tomorrow at 03:00 p.m. they're having what they call a dot swoosh session, and they're going to be, like, revealing what the. They're called our force one or of one. And they're going to be revealing the community, like, artwork that they decided was good or something like that. Like, I know in the months up to the launch, they had a whole, like, survey and polls and whatever across all their social media."

So kind of riffing off of what Tammy and what you were saying, how we can stay relevant is like, we're already here. So when all the people come and they're all, like, exploring and discovering this space for the first time, we'll already be here. And, like, personally, in my opinion, I think it's, like, good that we are already here and we can kind of help, you know, navigate some of this stuff because I'll tell you what my, so I'm actually low key tight about this, but my brother, who has no experience in Web three, no experience in nfts, like zero, like, exposure at all, he got airdropped a poster, and he's been texting me all day. He's like, yo, like, how do I do this? What wallet do I use? Like blah, blah blah this, blah, blah, blah that. And I'm like, bro, like I'm low key type, but I'm at work right now and I'll help you work through it. Just like give me like 1015 minutes here. And like, don't worry, bro. Like it's, you got the email, it'll be in your wallet. But basically if you're a Nike member, you're on this list. I don't know how they comprise it. I don't get to see under the hood like that. But if you're a Nike member, you have a chance to enter into the mint. The airdrop was only yesterday at 09:00 a.m. which kind of sucks, but I can say that I think it, I think they're going to be releasing it for public. I think like the first two weeks in May I or something like that. And then the idea behind it is just create an entire marketplace similar to, I don't know, like kicks a fire or like Stockx or goat. I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with those third party, like, okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Their idea is to create a marketplace like that and have the community trade the shoes inside of that. That way they can keep it in house, promote the brands and hopefully build off of that. What they're going to do after that, I have no idea. I can only guess they're going to be dropping more like air quote virtual merch, right. That you can redeem in real life because these air Force ones, you can redeem them and you can actually like get them and wear them and show them off. And I don't know, I think it's pretty cool. I'm super passionate."

        "text": "No, I think you've made some awesome points. The first one I want to touch on, I think is maybe the most important one, which is kind of the difference between how Nike is doing this versus maybe the while having ownership of Clonex where I mean, to me it's very evident that that's what this is in terms of them trying to onboard the normal sneaker head rather than the web three person because of how they actually gave out swoosh ids. So if you were paying attention, they went all over the country in person events and did these kind of, like, live swoosh sessions in which the people that were there would be, you know, kind of taught through, like, their tutorial of what it is, what they were offering, all that stuff, and then they were given a swoosh id on demand. Right? Like, or on site. And meanwhile, you had all the Clonex people like, well, where's our swoosh ids? And you know what? That was. What the communication was is like, hey, look, let us onboard. Like, this is meant to. Onboard. And onboarding is good for everybody. And so I see, like, what your point is there about the difference. And I think, like, what you can see is, you know, artifacts and Clonex, they have all this other kind of metaverse y plays going on, and I'm sure the tie in will come there. So I totally agree with you there. I definitely think it's a. It's a strong play by them to kind of corner their own marketplace for this stuff as well, because, you know, they lose on things that are being sold through these third party marketplaces."

Because, like, these people will get curious the second that you. The second that you, like, own an NFT, transact with it, sell it, get utility from it. It kind of turns the light bulb on, and then once that light bulbs on, that's when you go discover, like, we all got here one way or another from, like, that happening to us through top shot. And so I think that's a really important point as well. Chamber any reactions here before I kick it to Des, and then we'll. I just want to know when I'm."
