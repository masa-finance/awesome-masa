And so the market cap nuked from 680 all time high to bunch of cat dads with some sort of mental illness, decided that it would be a good idea to try to keep this thing alive. And so we did. And so we bought all of those sellers down there, scooped up a bunch of supply, and have started reviving this thing on the side. And as of today, we have recovered since Monday. Let's see.

And it's pretty wild to watch when it works. And, you know, this project that we are now taking over on side is like, you know, it's super early. This is. This has been going on a week. We're on day four of the community takeover. Takeover. And it's been going really well. But, like, it's. It's showing a ton of promise and. But, like, one, it's very difficult, and two, it's just so cool to see people come together and work against a goal that, like, they've never. Nobody's ever met each other, nobody knows each other. We've known each other for a week via, uh, you know, chatting in a telegram and things like that. And people show up, volunteer, show out, and it's really, really special. And, like, this is how these tokens, though, I'll tell you, if they start hitting exit velocity, this is how they really, really, really send. Because what's left is the diamond handed chads. And Chad that's. That are making this, that. That actually believe in it, right? It's nothing. It's already been pumped and dumped and sold by people who don't want to be here. And this is how you get the whiffs of the world. This is how you get the booms of the world. Like, there's no, like, people with was a community takeover. The dev sold all of it for $36,000. And the community has rallied to take it to billions of dollars in market cap. And that doesn't happen if you don't have this group of people that are willing to see it through and end up believing in it. Because guess where all the supply ends up in those people's hands to start. You know what I mean? And so it has to be that way and there has to be a real group effort. And. But when it happens, it's. It's really, really incredible. So we've got that going on with magic Internet cat. You could see giveaway posted up top. So we're doing a little giveaway. If you have not seen that yet, jump in there. It literally will end by the time this show is over. So you just have to follow the Twitter account.

We varied between 102 hundred holders, but really didn't, unfortunately, for a multitude of reasons, didn't get off the ground.

And it's difficult to try to keep these things afloat when the longer the timeline goes. And now it's a three month old meme coin that hasn't had any sort of major volume. We're talking millions of dollars worth of volume because that's what really people are looking for. It's hard to get other people excited about it. Obviously, the excitement comes from new coins, and, like, we were talking about the ansem stuff. A lot of these things happen quickly. So as someone that didn't want to, you know, I was trying to a help, you know, get people excited about our meme, but also didn't want to just like, bail on it. I don't like to bail on things. I like to see things through as long as humanly possible. You approached. You approached me about joining magic Internet cat, and we started, you know, it's kind of like, hey, like, what if we did this? And then I'm like, in my head, it was just like, there's no way, like, we can do it, like, you know what I mean? Just the logistics alone. I'm like, how are we ever going to do this? So we slowly, I think we chatted on Wednesday, I think, this weekend, I think. Yeah, I think it was Wednesday. Tuesday or Wednesday this week?"

And then we both took it back to the people we were working with and kind of expanded on it, and, you know, both sides came to, you know, figured out the framework of it that would work, I think, for. For both magic Internet cat and the make it all back community, I then, you know, I submitted the, you know, our plan, you know, because again, I want to bring the people that are part of my community some value. And this was the best way I could think of to bring them value in the situation we were currently in. So that was the decision I made to kind of give them some value, give them some volume, give them a bigger community with an interesting story. Like, again, magic and Erickat had the double rug double community takeover. Now we're adding an additional storyline of this is the first meme coin acquisition where we're bringing in a community that was not rugged, but had lost some momentum. But the benefit to the magic Internet cats was the volume we could provide. We gave everybody a 24 hours window to participate where they sent us, they sent their make it all back tokens to a wallet, which we collected and then subsequently airdropped. I think we're still in the process. The Solana network has been an absolute asshole over the past few days, but we're still. I think we're almost done, if not completely done, the airdrop for those make it all back holders. So they should have received, or shortly should be receiving their mic tokens. So it will then complete the first, the first merger of meme coins. Yeah, I think it's very exciting."

Anyway, we were able to work this out so that all of your holders will be airdropped, one plus 20% of their value. So essentially a 20% bump on their initial value, uh, in magic Internet cat tokens. And, uh, you guys then took your remaining liquidity that was left there and added it to our pool via some, some market buys. And now we are sitting at a nice, robust liquidity of 58k with a market cap of 239,000. So pretty interesting little maneuver there. And we'll see, we'll see how it goes."

We also gave people that were holding the make it all back token a 24 hours window to exit their position so they weren't exiting at a lower market cap than, you know what I mean, than previously. So I thought that was another kind of difficult task to do, because at the end of the day, the community members that wanted to stay along, that was kind of the easier part.

Had events not taken place, none of this would have happened. The universe conspires. I believe in all of our favors. And it's so funny. I'm a cat person. Bunshu is a cat person. There was a ticker dropped in an alpha group, group chat, whatever the fuck you guys want to call it, called coin market cap. And, you know, I'm an opportunist. I haven't really done anything in this space necessarily. I mean, I've really hosted spaces and stuff. I've made, obviously, a lot of comments and statements and, you know, I've definitely, you know, put said some shit that have upset people. And so, like, I genuinely, honestly, truly saw this as, like, the opportunity. My magnum opus, my masterwork, me proving that I not only know what I'm talking about, but that I, you know, can do things and put things together. So I did not start the community takeover. It was a weird way. We still need to verify things about the contract right now, but we do know liquidity is locked. The admin, the dev, whatever left, they still have tokens. So we've created a process to shake out the tree to get people that are buyers and committed. I'm, like, gamifying things. And so as I noticed this takeover was happening, I kind of stepped in as a game master. I've been in a few, like, shitters. You know, I've been in the space for a lot longer than people, I think, think. I remember $200 bitcoin. I remember Mount Gox before. And then when it got taken down, I remember when Coinbase did not have Ethereum. I remember a market before Ethereum. And so, like, I just stepped in and I said, look, like I've never really had a team of people. I found 30 people, roughly, that were willing to do different things. We had a brand, we had a ticker, we had a website, but that was not an official website. So literally in 48 hours. We created a new telegram channel. We migrated most of the active people. We've let people know that things are happening here without it being like a big thing. Obviously I've like, put out stuff on my profile and like been slowly trying to raise awareness. Obviously this is a personal branding opportunity. I'm going to do more stuff on Warpcast because, you know, this is the time I might as well. I'm not trying to be a founder. I'm positioning myself as game master, the person that is going to make it fun for everybody. But, you know, cat, coin, market cap, Solana. I mean, liquidity pools, mergers and acquisitions, I don't really need to, I think, spell out much, but that's my vision. I've created a rock soup, necessarily. I'm structuring it as executive lead, making sure multi sigs are set up correctly. Crossing t's dotting is passwords are going to be used with password management. Things have been happening. I'm actually taking this weekend, basically. I've taken today off, taking Monday off. I'm pushing through. We're going to have like a real website that's going to do things, but we are. The website is just a marketing funnel like everyone has. Oh, we're going to make money on listings. We are not making money on listings. It is a marketing funnel. The Internet loves cats. Why not create the opportunity to send your mother, your brother, your son, that kid down the street. Learn about Solana shitcoins. See what these meme coins are. Learn a little bit. The indicators will have breakdown sections. How do you dollar cost average into something? What is market making? How do we sustain Solana shitters? How do we sustain the overall crypto market? Because what I identified in Solana shitters was too many spot buyers without like, incoming liquidity to buy up or capture the action when it dips. So people will throw 25 but not have two and a half sold to throw after it when it dips 95%. And so, like, they're stuck holding a bag at a much higher cost basis. The same thing happened in crypto, the same thing has happened in bitcoin. And so I'm just testing out thesis. I'm talking to people if anyone is interested, like it is all open. I am trying to make like I need to be a certain, I don't like to be the character that I am, but I am trying to do things a certain way to make sure that the brand stays alive. And I'm really just acting as brand steward until things are really in formation and making it easier for people to get in onboarded, volunteer help out. We're like setting up community emails and that's going to be managed through password managers. I've put out things just to, just to say like I've been here and I've seen a lot of community takeovers fail. I wanted to do this the right way and I made sure with the 30 people that also volunteered to help that we've all done it. And the thing that I think community takeovers fail at most is trying to put too much workload on one person. So I've always found two or three people that will be as backups that like I define leads, right? Like just like an executive does right now. I'm essentially acting as marketing lead and CEO, guiding the ship towards a north Star where we're going to partner up with magic Internet cat and you know, figure out how to pair liquidity. We're going to partner up with bag and other projects Blue and Nubcat and find liquidity and really just turn this into something where the market overall continues to grow rather than continuing to just shit on the space. Make something of legacy of legitimacy and take this somewhere."

When it happens, it's a mess and there's chaos and there's people's money involved, there's people's emotions involved and like everybody. And there, and at the beginning it's, at the beginning it's just chaos, right? Like nobody knows and you're trusting other people and you are, and like nobody knows what to do and there has to be, you know, some sort of leadership formed, some sort of people that step up and put some organization and even that takes a while to kind of shake out and find a, uh, but once you, once you get that then you need to, like you said, you're, you gotta make sure what's left is a really, really strong community that believes in the vision together and is going to kind of hold the ground because it's not going to be easy and, or fast, right? Like that's the thing because once these happen the volume dries up because they think you're just dead and you have to kind of re, get out there and tell everybody you aren't dead. And it is what everybody thought it was. To begin with, just come along for the ride, right? Like this token, we're talking about magic Internet cat, right? It had, you know, four, four $5 million on day one of volume. Like it was not dead from the get go. But then, you know, that happens and everybody's on to the next thing.

Because I've taken a market making thought into this market as a whole. I don't buy once into anything. That's a spot by you don't market buy until you make your second purchase, right? Like that's. That's the major difference. So I cost averaged into this. I have a really nice, okay, like I have, I think 300,000. I really want to get to 500,000. And then I'm basically designing a game where accumulation, shaking the tree. And then my incentive is to grow my bag, including the bags of everyone that has accumulated. And it's like, I've seen other projects do this. I've already brought in social people that are planning content. Like, I just pinned up something, go follow that account, because that's where everything's coming from. I'm just like kind of getting the flywheel started. And I've always. A lot of people, especially in this, like, in some of the conversations we have to remember on Solana shitcoins, we don't know where anyone's coming from. Some of these people are like a year into this and like, have Solana and some ease. Some people come from traditional finance backgrounds and I don't quite understand tokenomics. They understand how to run a business. So I just. I personally am just a person that knows how to read people. I think I always have had that skill. I just. It is a natural thing for me. I am on the spectrum. So it's something I needed to develop myself to be able to like, function in the world. Many years ago, I was not as articulate as I am today.
