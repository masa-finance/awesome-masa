We put him to bed around, like, an hour or two before the fireworks went off, and it's like, you know what? He's old enough to recognize that this is cool. So we got him up to watch it just through our back porch. But tonight some friends are throwing a shindig, and I guess they've been doing this for years. This is our first time going, and they've got a firework kind of end of night extravaganza, so we'll see how that goes.

My question for you then, bunchu and anybody else honestly is let's say that 4 July falls on say a Thursday. So could it bleed into the fall and weekend as opposed to the weekend before and then let's say, let's split it down the window, down the middle. Rather it falls on a Wednesday.

But there was like a dozen doodles available to auction when the floor was like one, three. And there's a first bid bonus. So to incentivize people to bid on these, endow incentivizes them depending on how much is out there with these doodles, it was a 0.2 e first bid bonus. So it's like free money. Now, granted, you're risking catching a falling knife or attempting to here and the floors keep dropping, but I think this is an interesting time to trade and particularly leverage these assets coming from auction. If you can time it right. Like, all those doodles are gone now because someone saw it. And it was an easy. Because you're getting the extra .2 now the risk is like, it's a 24 hours auction. So in that case, if the floor falls more than 0.2 in those 24 hours, you're in the red. But I think some of these, as we start finding some floors, if you're interested in trading, I think those potentially going into auction and taking advantage of that first bid bonus is a risky way to trade in this market.

I'm actually really, you know, remember a couple of weeks ago when I got suspended and went on that rant about how I should spend less time on Twitter because, you know, stuff out of my control was going to happen and I was going to.
