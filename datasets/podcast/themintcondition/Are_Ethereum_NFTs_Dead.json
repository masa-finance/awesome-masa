So it's been cool to see how everything's, everything's progressed and, you know, the women's sports getting, getting its due and a lot of times it's, it's more exciting than, than some of the, some of the men's games, I'd say for sure."

You know, if you hearken back to the late seventies, like the Michigan NC State or not NC state, Indiana state games with bird and, and magic and how that, like people don't, some people may not know, like bird and magic like revived the game of basketball like it was, I would suggest anybody go watch like what was the Will Ferrell movie where he owned the leagues were on the verge of collapse and I feel semi for all, definitely highlights that and magic and Bird like just absolutely resurrected it.

You know, she doesn't. My kid doesn't not look like Caitlin Clark. You know what I mean? Like, she kind of. You know what I mean? So she can see somebody that is. You know, she doesn't look.

And then obviously, Solana as a whole and that, you know, that turned into Solana meme coins. And there's just been so much focus on Solana over the past little bit. Now we're seeing, you know, now we're seeing l two s. I've heard there are l three s, apparently now, which is very confusing. I don't even know what that is, but I've seen that next week we'll."

There are some. Some meme coins and stuff like that that have popped off quite nicely on some of those l two s. But I would say as a whole, not there yet. So I don't know, I think people are dogging Ethereum. I think Ethereum's going to have its day once it starts running, because it hasn't been correlated with bitcoin and Solana. I feel like bitcoin and Solana definitely popped off harder over the past little bit. I think Ethereum has some time to catch up. And if Ethereum all of a sudden starts making a move that is bigger than bitcoin or Solana, we'll see new nfts come in, we'll see some older nfts kind of revive a little bit.

But, I mean, Kat made a good point this morning, which was like, you know, there's plenty of people that are holding their apes and there's plenty of people selling it to go, you know, for the opportunity cost and some of those people are going to put it all in meme coins and they're going to lose it all and wish they had their ape. Right. So like I, which I think is viable. Yeah, no, very. So like, you know, you got to know yourself if you're holding one of these things and decide if that's your journey or not. Right?

It's what happens when sellers are gone and volume ticks up. Everything gets a God candle. It's going to be the same for certain NFT collections. I don't think all of them. I think some existing ones will re catch a bid when the attention dies down. And maybe, maybe it proves that. Like, and I'm not saying this is true or not, I'm just philosophizing. Maybe it is. Maybe we learn that NFTs are more of a bear market attention thing in terms of. Yeah, no, that's in terms of like, where to store your value rather than where to create it, which I don't think is that far fetched. Right? You go make a million bucks this cycle, you don't want to take it all to your bank account. You see a bottomed out five eth floor ape, you might buy a couple of those, or you might buy a crypto punk as a store of value or a fidenza as a store of value.

When you think about when board apes really caught fire last time, it was in the PvE part of the cycle. In the PvP part, you had people like me selling at eight ETH because I thought I could do better elsewhere at the time with that money. Right. Like, and it took a really, really long time for them to really go parabolic like that. But it was when I. We were full bull and, you know, your grandmother was asking you how to buy a monkey pic that they went. That they went insane. And so, like, I think that it's at that part of the cycle where people are trying to rotate into where their opportunity is, and then as it gets deeper and deeper into it, there's just going to be more eyes and more attention everywhere. Right? Like, that's it. That's the thing is, like, right now, it feels like some places are, you know, you look inside, the lights are off, the door is closed, and you'll walk down the street in a couple of months and every place will have a line out the door.

So remember, remember last Friday, we were, we were approaching all time highs as the podcast was going on. It was great. Everything was going. It then became the community takeover part one. Dev decided he was rugging it and sent the thing to zero. Literally went from, at the time of our recording, we were pushing over 400,000 market cap at that time. And it went to, at its low, 28. $28,000 market cap. $28,000 market cap."

The story's not over, by the way, if this doesn't sound like the makings of a multi million dollar market cap comeback, I don't know what does the, so, you know, we're all rallying at that point. Some folks decide they're going to take it over. They set up a new telegram, a new, a new Twitter. You know, there's a small little team going at it and I kind of, you know me, it's like I'm around there, I stick my head in the community. All of a sudden I've got a side hustle, you know, it's like. So I found myself somehow in the middle of it and was working with the guy that kind of took it over, just giving him ideas, volunteering for some stuff, all the stuff, stuff. And this was now into Saturday. We pushed a little revival from, let's see, $24,000 or the $28,000 market cap to we peaked again at 141 70 on sometime on Saturday. And then the dude that was that took it over, who set up the new telegram, set up the new Twitter, set up all the new stuff owned, all of the stuff goes Mia, sells his tokens and, and just doesn't respond. So now whoever has left had no access to the Twitter, has no access to the telegram to do any, like, admin stuff, anything like that. So we got double rugged here, right then from, you know, Saturday to, gosh, Sunday, yesterday, whatever, we went back from 170 to 43k market cap. That was where we ended up. And the last couple of days, a new group has emerged. Seven of us have decided we will revive this thing if it's the, the last thing we do. And as of today, new Twitter, new telegram, new group. We hit 480k market cap this morning. We caught a bid and we hit 447 at the high. And it retraced a little because you got to figure all those old people underwater wanted their exit pump, right. Retrace a little. Currently sitting at 146. So we've gone from 26k, sitting currently at 146. And I think we're looking up. I think things are looking up. We got some juice going. We got some juice going. And I said, let's bring the fam along with. And it's. So I bought, I bought a nice amount of tokens in that 22k range. So I'm sitting with some nice supply that I can share with my fam. And like I said, don't, don't dump it on my head, please."

Yeah, so join the telegram, come share some cat memes, follow the Twitter. This is going to be, I'm telling you, I'm going to will this into existence. It's going to be manifested into millions.

Say 30% on the day, 40% on the day, and you're like, maybe you're seeing something else move. You know, say something else is up, like 15% to 20% the rotator. Right? Like, well, do I rotate and catch the momentum on this other one? My thought has continuously been, there is more upward, there's more opportunity to make up that difference on the bag I'm currently holding. So my best option is always to kind of, you know, if I can. If I can double dip or I can add more to that bag to, you know, DCA it, because it's taken such a pullback that I think there's going to be more upward momentum possibility in that particular bag.

The lowest one is on an aggressive pullback, there's a good chance it's going to go there. And so I've watched so many of these do the same thing in the past two, three weeks that I would probably. I would probably, depending on how high above that zone I was, sell the bag and look, to buy that zone or DCA at that level to come back from that would be how I would play it. But I'm also getting chopped a little bit. But I'm not a rotator, obviously. Over the past couple weeks, I am a. I made. I'm a community member. Unfortunately, that's what I fucking am. Like, that is who I am. I, like, crocs was giving me a little bit of shit in the shit Quinn chat today, and I had to literally come to the realization, like, what am I doing? I just gave myself an extra set of job that I didn't fucking need, that I don't have time for, that I didn't need, and, like, because I'm gonna. Cause I like to build stuff. So, like, I tried to do the same thing with the Pepe and Solana. The problem with that one was it was way too high already. Like, I already bought it pre pumped, so I couldn't do the things with it that I wanted to. Right? Like, my bag was not big enough where I could go airdrop some people, for example. Right? Like, it just wasn't. And, like, it needed stuff like that. So, um. But I'm a community member and a builder, and that's just the roles I keep finding myself in. You know what I mean?"

It got a little front ran or the shine taken off of it when the pepe you're referring to went crazy last year and now continues to do so now hit a three or $4 billion market cap, whatever the heck it got to. This pepe coin is more than just a meme coin. There's a lot of crazy utility stuff going on with it. And it's right at this intersection of, like, all the stuff I love, which is, like, meme culture, art, and, like, serious AI development, which is really, really interesting. So they're also doing this project, the same developers tying in this project they're working on called based AI. Our friend Fanzo, who we've had on this show before, and he's a frequenter of coffee with captain, did a really, really, really nice 20 minutes YouTube video breakdown, if you're interested in learning about it. But so these devs are essentially building this incredible AI l one and launching these things called brains. And I've only been involved here for a day or so, so I don't know all the little details, but it's super intriguing. You're essentially staking your pepe coin for that you'll eventually burn for these brains, and. Or you're holding your pepe coin, because you have to. It's, you know, you have to stake it for other things. They've got this trading bot coming out that's powered by these tokens. And the tokenomics of the coin are really interesting.

I would imagine I would be like, you know, once you know and can't have it, it's like, well, what the hell? And so it was Easter. My, we were out in the driveway doing Easter egg hunt with the kids. My cousin was there, and we're standing in the driveway. It's me, my mom, my cousin. My kids are running around, and he goes, oh, you got to try these. And he just hands them to me. And he's like, I was like, what is it? And he's like, oh, they're the colorblind glasses. And he, because he's also colorblind. And I was like, did they work? And he's like, yeah, they work for me. And so I kind of got, like, put on the spot. I didn't have a, like, I didn't, it wasn't a decision. It was a, you're putting these on, and I put them on and I'll end it, or I'll start with this, which was like, I made that tweet. And if you go through that tweet in the comments chamber, there's, I don't know, one or two folks in there that are, like, literally posting YouTube videos of how the glasses are scam and it's debunked and it doesn't work. X, y and Zenith. And they're like, telling me, oh, how much are they paying you? How much stock in the company do you own? And I'm like, bro, I don't even own a pair of these glasses. They weren't even mine. But I gotta tell you, I put them on, and it was, I got emotional. It was wild. So what I was looking at was an american flag. And I did not realize how much different I see the world than everybody else because I put these things on and I saw the red on the american flag in true red for the first time. And it was, it was pretty epic. And I don't give a shit what those YouTube videos say. I know what my eyes say, and it worked. It's not a cure for colorblindness. It, of course not. So don't think of that. Don't think of it as that. I think it enhances your, I don't even know how it possibly works. I don't know the science behind or what they claim the science behind it is.

Color and taste and, and stuff like that. Like, I always think it's weird. I'm like, well, when I see red, okay, and I know I'm not colorblind, but even that, like, I see red and somebody else that's not colorblind, they're like, oh, that's also red. But is it the same? Like, are we seeing the same color?"
