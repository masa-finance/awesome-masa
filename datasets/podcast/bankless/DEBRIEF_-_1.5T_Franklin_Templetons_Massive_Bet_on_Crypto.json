Um, actually had not run across Sandy, although she's written a lot of things. It's just been, like, sort of outside of my, um, my focus. And I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I was, like, very, very surprised that, uh, she could speak so coherently about crypto."

She's like, right, right up there setting the direction and strategy. But what. What did you think of Sandy?"

One was, um, we're entering the world from, like, we are making platform based investments. Like, Wall street loves these platforms. Amazon, Facebook, these are the big ones, and now we're making network based investments. Uh, it's an evolution. It's an easy metaphor to carry. Try to find people to. That was new to me, even though it's explaining crypto in the same way that everyone tries to explain crypto. But like, in this novel new way that I think is very effective. And then a token where she has, like, the discrepancy between the asset and the contract. One is a piece of paper. One is, I don't even know what an asset is in tradfi, actually. How do you even. I don't even know how to think about that. Like, what is a rapid, also a piece of paper."

But like, in tradfi terms, you really emphasize, like, the gap, the, the billions of dollars gap between these two things that have created entire, like, verticals and industries of inefficiency. Like, it's just returning back to base principles, which I think, like, you know, doing this podcast for four years, we are so far down the rabbit hole that, like, we don't touch these things nearly as much as we do, frequently do. But now we are with these stratified people because they are explaining crypto in this 2024 101 way towards another billion set of people and trillions of dollars."

I think that tokens as a chameleon is the first time I've heard them put that way. And what she meant was, sometimes it looks like a stock, sometimes it looks like a bond, sometimes it looks like a commodity. Right. And so just explaining that in tradfied terms, I think is immensely helpful. Also, talking about valuation, the way that we talk about valuation is somewhat vindicating, at least for me, which is just very much like, how do investors, seasoned investors, think about this asset class? And I, uh. Yeah, she's doing that. I, I think that, um, you know, I asked the answer very lightly about Aml KyC and, like, hinted that there could be some conflict. I mean, for, for bankless listeners, of course, or you guys, for you guys listening. This is, this has, um, been a reoccurring theme of. Part of, I feel like, my trepidation with letting our. Trepidation with letting the banks in here, which is basically like that, they co opt and they start sponsoring legislation to. They need AML KYC for their use case, and I'm fine with that. For your pool of capital, I get it. You need that. You are a regulated institution in a geography known as the United States. And if you don't do that, you're going to go to jail. Cool. Do that, implement it. That's fine. Do not push that. Do not go hand in hand."

Why is that good for FTX? It's great for SPF. It's good if you're a bank. It's good if you. Because you don't have to compete with these. You're already doing Aml Kyc. You don't have to compete with Defi anymore. So it's a way of, like, pulling up the ladder. It's a way of, like, regular. It's regulatory capture. I mean, you see this everywhere.

They don't have it in their DNA necessarily, except the individuals. But the company itself, the structure itself, the machine of a bank corporation, does not have the ability to fight for civil liberties. Right.

You can't control this. We have some shared interests, and so I think that will continue to be true. I just. The one shared interest we don't have is, and we do have a shared interest around privacy.

It is the benchmark for the stake rate of ETH staking index. It's an index. It's basically a primitive. It's an oracle primitive. These are crypto words. An oracle primitive for Tradfi to make financial instruments around the ETH stake rate so that it can unlock a bunch of potential financial vehicles, financial assets to be traded in tradfi."

It's a money Lego, especially when the ETH ETF exists as a money Lego for expressing more financial instruments in tradfi. I bet all of crypto is like, I don't get it. What the fuck? I kind of understand, but like, what? Uh, we were going to do an episode on this and we're going to talk about like, why this is so big."
