It's like the markets a kind of have is like written off how big of a deal these interest rates are anymore because they are also slowing down and getting smaller. But also inflation is coming down. But also all of the points that people have originally made is like, sure, we can jack up interest rates to combat inflation, but the Fed has a date with destiny, and that destiny is to print money at some point in time. And so I think there's a decent possibility that the markets have written off the pivot. We've forgotten about it. But at some point in time, the money printer must resume. And whether that's one year, three years, five years, ten years, I don't know. But, like, I think the market has written that off."

        "text": "David, you're starting to sound a little bit like radio to me. Yeah, I guess you're bullish crypto, you're bearish government debt. Do you remember, I think it was a couple of roll ups ago where I asked this question about all this Fed tightening interest rates raised from basically close to 0% all the way to above 5%. Right. And I remember being told at that time, and a lot of the prognosticators were saying that will absolutely devastate everything like that will be a catastrophe, widespread job loss, stock market will go down, all of these bad things. It would happen. And so, I mean, I was told the Fed tightening would nuke everything. And the question is, why didn't it? Guess what? I think Ray Dalio is a listener to the bankless podcast, because he heard that question maybe, and wrote his entire post about that this week. And he answered the question, and I think he did a good job answering it. Here's the, here is the take from Ray Dalio on why there was a big government engineering shift in wealth from, one, the public sector, the central government, and central bank, and, number two, the holders of government bonds to the private sector, which are households and businesses. This made the private sector relatively insensitive to the Fed's very rapid tightening to a more normal monetary policy. And as a result of this coordinated government maneuver, the household sector's balance sheets and income statements are in good shape while the governments are in bad shape. So that's why unemployment is low. Feels like the private sector is doing okay. The stock market is almost all time high, because you know who took all the bullets for us? The government. The US balance sheet, that $32 trillion that we were looking at over there. And bondholders. That was the take. He simplifies it a little bit more. Simply, central banks took on a lot more debt, so their balance sheets deteriorated, and the central banks printed a lot more money, which caused inflation to rise and bought a lot of the debt to get money into the hands of the private sector, which now, as a result, is in relatively good shape financially. So, yeah, bondholders took a haircut. The government's balance sheet took all the bullets. The private sector's doing okay. Wealth inequality increased even more. And that begs the question of, what's the next phase of all of this? And I think the answer, according to Ray Dalio, is more money printing, as you're saying, but a different type of money printing. We already did the qa qe thing. We already did the buying bonds thing. The next step, according to Ray Dalio's long term cycles and his planning, is basically helicopter money directly to the people to decrease wealth inequality, all sorts of government programs, fiscal and central bank programs, kind of become the same, and we're just printing money and giving it to the people. That's kind of the next step."

        "text": "Yeah, so there was a vulnerability in the coding language viper, that curve used for some of its pools. So this is actually pretty damn deep in the tech stack. And so I don't think it was anything in the way that curve pools were built, but because they use Viper, and because Viper forgot. Forgot to have these reentrancy checks in their codebase. As a result, it allowed for a reentrancy attack, which is a pretty known attack. It's actually how the dao hack got drained back in 2016. And so curve had a reentrancy attack thanks to. I guess thanks to the coding language viper that forgot to have reentrancy checks in it. $70 million was drained from four curve pools. The Pindle eth pool, the metronome eth pool, alchemyx eth pool, and then the curve eth liquidity pool, about $20 million, was actually recovered by white hat hackers and Mev bots, interestingly enough, which is an interesting little side quest of this story. But the big story is that because of the curve EtH pool, $5.1 million of curve tokens, 7.2 million curve tokens was drained and then taken into the exploiter's wallethead. Now, that's one thing that's bad, because this exploiter gets $7.2 million. The reason why this goes from a bad story about curve to a bad story about DeFi is because the curve founder, Michael Igorov, had taken out about $110 million of stablecoin loans against his 460 million curve tokens, which was almost $300 million at the pre exploit price. Then once you put $7 million of curve tokens into the hands of an exploiter, people start to react to that, because that is, you know, we are just one button press away from dumping $5.1 million of curve tokens into the market. So people start to withdraw liquidity. People who are providing liquidity to curve across DeFi, either in stablecoin pairs with curve or eth pairs with curve, they start to yoink liquidity because they don't want to get dumped on. So liquidity starts to dry up around curve. And so that makes the liquidity profile around curve very precarious. And especially when Michael has $110 million of collateral of borrowed stable coins against his curve collateral, he is under duress. His positions are under duress. And if that curve exploiter decided to liquidate his curve, they would cause a cascading liquidations if Michael was not able to bolster up his positions. He has since sold about $16 million of curve to pay back some of his loans, but he still has 90 something million dollars in loans to pay back across Defi protocols. Now here's all of the Defi protocols that Michael has put curve tokens into and borrowed stable coins from. Aave V two is the biggest one coming in at 300 million curve tokens, which is 34% of the circulating supply of CRV. Abracadabra has 51 million. Frax lens had 41 million. Inverse finance at 25 million, staked out had 3 million. Silo had 2 million. This guy put curve across Defi and then borrowed stable coins. Like. Like I said, 110 million stable coins. And so all of these are in precarious positions. If curve goes down to the price of, I think, $0.34, it's currently at $0.38, last I checked. But if it ever went to $0.34, he would be liquidated, and that would cause."

What did this man do with the $110 million that he borrowed from all these Defi protocols? Well, just a few months ago, he happened to have bought a $40 million mansion and also a second one. So he's got 2 million like multi million dollar mansions in Melbourne, in Australia that he bought. One of them he bought just a few months ago. I don't know about the other one."

And so this is Brian Armstrong's chain. It's not actually, but associated with Coinbase, therefore associated with Brian Armstrong, who is a bald man, who was a bullish bald man. So the bald token was made. And so that launched on July 30. When all tokens are minted, they all start at a valuation of zero. And that went to $50 million in market cap in just under a day with over $100 million of trading volume. Now, this is a pre mainnet base. One of the reasons why this just rocketed to $50 million in market cap is because you can't actually leave base. You can only go on base. You can't go out of base. There's no off ramp. There is now, since an off ramp. But while this thing was pumping, there was no way to get off of base. And so ball token just created $50 million out of thin air.

Do you think Wall street analysts understand how to value that thing?

The lawsuit says that Hart continually touted these investments as a pathway to grandiose wealth for investors, claiming that Hex, for example, was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of Mandev. Although Hart claimed these investments were for the vague purpose of supporting free speech, he did not disclose that he used millions of dollars of pulse chain investor funds to buy luxury goods for himself. As a result of this suit, Hex, Pulsechain, and Pulsex have all dropped a lot. I put a. I got a chart tab if you want to open up that one. Hex went from one penny to half a penny, down 50%, which is pretty bad. Pulse chain went from $0.001 so one 10th of one penty down to 600th of one penny.

So it's incredibly distasteful. Not what this industry should represent. We could go on about it. I think the question in my mind is what is the actual difference between Hex and XRP, though?

Anyways, Martin Screlly is replying to Eric Wall, and Martin Screlly is the guy who went to jail for jacking up, I think, like, epipen costs. Remember him? And now he's in crypto, and so he goes, if you look at page 90 of these sentencing guidelines, he is already at 40 points, which, if you look at the sentencing chart in the same PDF, is recommended life sentence with all the victims. It's a rough situation if he gets cuffed. So this is talking about the Department of Justice. And so Martin Screli is saying that he might rack up enough, whatever these points are. Rack up enough points. And Martin Screlley would be very familiar with this as somebody who he racked up, he said 39 points.

But first, a moment to talk about our fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially metamask portfolio, the portfolio you need to help navigate the incoming bull market, because we're feeling bullish. We're going to go hear from them right now. Binance could face fraud charges from the Department of Justice. The US DOJ officials are considering fraud charges against Binance. They're concerned about the cost to consumers, according to people familiar with the matter reported by Semaphore.com. federal prosecutors worry that if they indict Binance, it could cause a run on the exchange similar to the one that befell the now bankrupt platform FTX, causing customers to lose money and potentially spurring a panic in the crypto market. Binance and his co founder CZ are already facing charges, of course, from the SEC, in addition to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. So the Department of Justice wants to charge finance with fraud, but they're not going to out of fear that it will cause an FTX style run on the bank, which is interesting."

Or finance does have a hole in its balance sheet and the Department of Justice does know something. And so this is a real concern. I'm going to cautiously go with the former because I kind of am grouping binance and tether fud is the same things like I've heard 10,000 tethers fuds. I've heard about 5000 finance fuds.

And so it's an incentive to get devs. It pays devs. Like, if you are a dev and you make a contract on a layer two and people use your contract, you get money. So it's a financing mechanism."

Also, this week, I saw a tweet here that Ryan's got pulled up from Martin Koppelman, who's also a creator of a different decentralized identity protocol. And so he was retweeting this tweet that did some address analysis from worldcoin addresses. So they've detected, like, in this tweet, in this image, three different clusters of worldcoin addresses that all appear to converge down to one address. And so it looks like 130 individual addresses actually are just three people stock this. Exactly. So it has been Sybil attacked. And so if you read the Eric Walt Twitter tweeter. Tweeter, Twitter thread, xthread, basically the TLDR is like, yeah, every single world coin account is 100% verifiable, a unique pair of eyeballs. That doesn't mean that it is in the hands of a unique person. And this is what we are seeing here today. So this, the whole premise of worldcoin, and even anyone giving legitimacy to worldcoin, which included me, is based on the fact that they can actually produce civil resistance.

Um, uh, but I think that episode, that number is public somewhere that was announced way back when with the, with the base screen. Anyways, we will get those details. So that, that's how this works.

There will always be some nuances, there will always be some smart contract risks because layer twos are smart contracts, but with permissionless sequencers, trustless bridges, all of the things that decentralize layer two chains. Also with some time, some Lindy layer twos will give you basically the same security guarantees as layer ones. And that is why we are doing the layer two roadmap. That's why Ethereum is a roll up centric roadmap, because we have found ways to make scalable chains have the same security guarantees as the layer ones. It's always been part of the vision. And so I don't even necessarily think ZK rollups are the only will have a monopoly on this. It's just they have a little bit faster path there. Optimistic roll ups will have the also have the same security guarantees, but that is the layer two vision, the layer one and the layer twos.

So you can see this on layer two beats what I have in front of us. A lot of them are at stage zero, doesn't offer that full, decentralization or stage one, which is kind of training wheels. They need to get to stage two and that's where everything is permissionless. All the sequencers are completely whitelisted. Upgrades are handled correctly. Well, those are the caveats and we're certainly not there yet with layer twos. The other thing I'll say is there is this dependency on the trustless bridge from ethereum to a layer two on that working. So some smart contract code there, of course, and smart contract code can have bugs, so there's that dependency as well. But for all intents and purposes, it's almost the same security guarantees as the layer two. Once we get to this stage two level for across, across these roll ups."

Real sustainable cash flows with paths to scale, large markets, all competitors now dead or thoroughly discouraged. No VC money to fund. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th place. Consolidation, blue chippery. I think what Vance is saying is we're the off of the shitcoin roller coaster and we are focusing on quality and fees. That was one of my big takeaways from ECC, is like the maturation and verticalization of so many DeFi protocols. And this is the take that Kane Warwick gave me, ECC 2022 a year ago, that we are in now a bull market for fees.

The game that I'm talking about when I'm setting up my bull market battle station is the game that like, there was two main. Two. Yeah.

And that's the game that I'm talking about is the phenomenon comes and you buy, you press buy early, and you just ride it. And it's a kind of a gamble. Loot was absolutely a gamble.

There is the self staking at home optimization game where ethereum yield is not homogenous. You, if you play the game well, can increase your yields just by staking. And so you're not perusing twitter, you're not making gambles, you are just refining your system. I can't play that game nearly as well because I leave and go away from home. And so I can't play that game nearly as well. But that is a very valid game to play as well. So figure out what game you want to play and then set up your battle station for that."

The Defi founders in particular did not orphan their projects early. I feel like that happened with a lot of defi projects as they got orphaned. The founders left, the parents left before they could grow into functional adults. But there are a number of founders who stayed, and I'm very bullish on those founders, and as a result, I'm bullish on those projects too. Synthetix Kane is one. He kind of left. Now he's back a little bit."

All of these founders stayed. And I just want to give a big shout out to the founders who stayed. They are settlers, not tourists. And yeah, I think we have the potential to build the fangs of Defi, as Vance was saying. And it's going to be done not over one cycle, but over multiple cycles. And so big shout out to all of the founders who've just dug deep and had the grit to actually stay through these cycles. I think the results will show for themselves."

And also I will also say that maker doubt not just, not just Rune Christiansen, but there's a number of very early maker Doug's who are still working on Makerdao and then also have gone off to found other projects. And so not to say that, like, hey, you must stick with your first project and your first baby until the end of time. But just staying in crypto, like bankless was not my first job. So sticking around generally is always the way to wealth and success."

People's biggest complaints, amazingly, seems to be that, quote, there's too much focus on infrastructure, which from the point of view of almost any other sociopolitical system in the world today sounds like not a complaint but a success story. It's honestly really heartening to hear Vitalik say that crypto culture isn't the best place that it's been because crypto culture has not always been so great. Like, we just spent a bunch, we."
