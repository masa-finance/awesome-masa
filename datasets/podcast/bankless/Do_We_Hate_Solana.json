And the case for that was basically, well, it's all the same conversation about, like, what are crypto fundamentals? And that is the topic. So, like, part of the Twitter conversation here, this is a tweet from Italio. Just watch the latest bankless hq episode and quoted Solana is more narrative than actual fundamentals. One of us may have said that. Probably said that. And he goes, you have an l, two and 527. You have an l. Sorry, you have an l, one, and 527. L two s stuck in a vicious infrastructure cycle. But that's fundamentals for these guys. I'm going to put Ryan in the bit boy category from now on. So I had a nice little conversation with this guy on Twitter, and I said this ethereum was also more narrative than fundamentals last cycle. But by fundamentals, I mean profitable block space sales. And I defined it as such in the episode. It's fine if you disagree. I could be wrong. It's a bankless takes episode. So we give our hot takes one thing. I'll just say there is like, that's what the episode is. It's our hot takes. I don't know that. Is this episode format a good idea?"

I asked him, what am I most wrong about? Would you say he's the entire thesis around ethereum layer two versus Solana? And I said, it's an investment thesis. You're welcome to have your own argue for it. Right? Like, that's it. It's an investment thesis.

Take that we all, as an industry, and everyone looking at these assets, looking to buy them, has a framework for valuing them. Because if we don't, okay, any pump and dump, like, memetic narrative thing can go from like one to 2000, 20,000 and then back to zero. And it's all memetic. It's all a bunch of dogecoin. And my hope for this industry is that we get beyond memetic pricing and we actually just like other capital assets in the real world, we have some takes on how to value this space. And yes, we might not get it right, we have to change this over time. But that, to me, is like a sign of maturity, and it's important. So I'm always looking for it and I'm open to adjusting what the fundamentals are and how to value the space. But, like, if we don't have some sort of foundation for how we talk about these assets and value them, aren't we just falling prey to whatever, like, pump and dump narrative memetic thing exists? We're just a bunch of memes, aren't we?"

Because people haven't been listening to bank lists forever and they don't understand, like, David and Ryan's emphasis on fundamentals or the motivations. And then we are also the opinionated media company who's got opinions about stuff. And so those two particles combine and it results in the effect of just like, ethereum's got the fundamentals. That's why we emphasize it, that's why we talk about it. It's good for the industry that the number two blockchain has very strong fundamentals. That's why I believe in the flipping. And that's just grounding crypto in reality, which it's been disconnected for, for almost its entirety of its existence. These are the things that we want to see more of in the industry. And then when we see, like, so much, just like, narrative excitement around Solana and we don't see that same grounding in reality, it turns into us punching down."

        "text": "So, like, the narrow definition of fundamentals that we were talking about in that episode is basically like capital asset fundamentals. It's like P and L. It's like, I'm under the belief right now, I think, that we can start to value our layer one assets based on how much cash it actually throws out, like discounted cash flow, like school of finance. Other people will say, what the eff are you doing? Like, one? It's way too early to do that. This asset class can't be valued like other asset classes yet. We're still trying to figure this out. And so don't even talk about block space, profit or revenue or anything like that. Doesn't matter. Another school of thought will say, well, actually, we don't want any of these things to be profitable at all. It's a fantastic strategy for a blockchain to subsidize user fees in order to get more users through issuance. That's a brilliant way to do it. It's called business development. It's called growth. Why are we getting on our high horse when we have the population of a midsize us city using crypto right now? The prize is millions of users. The actual fundamentals here should be user experience, like active users, like the apps, the dev teams, is it actually going to work? And onboard people and you, a bunch of ETH holders and maximalists are narrowly defining it as how much block space you sold. And like, who cares? It's all about network effect and users. And people are using a chains like Solana, and they're like, this is better, right?"

And I will take the fact that in the near term that it doesn't really matter. It's more noise. And if you invested based off of, like, block space sales or fundamentals, you would not have made as nearly as much. You would have underperformed the market probably in the fullness of time, because it's all narrative based. Right. And so there's this era in crypto in which narrative really, really matters, because this is very young industry, and we're all trying to price in the future when there's such little amount of reality grounding."

It's like, that's a narrow way of doing this. Uh, like, just having good ux is something that people experience, like, and firsthand, and that turns into their version of reality, which is totally, like, valid. And it's, like, secondary to the fact, like, that's great that you have ux, but does it translate into block space sales? The reason why block space sales are so important is that you were the. One of the core tenets of the bankless thesis is positive, positive economics. Because positive economics means that your system is going to stand the test of time. It captures more value than it leaks. If your system leaks more value over time, then in the fullness of time, it will eventually not work. It will eventually dissipate. It might be if you only leak a little bit of value, it might work for, like, I don't know, a very long time, thousands of years, perhaps. And so, granted that there is wiggle room here with how fast your system leaks value versus how fast it doesn't. Like, terra Luna leaked way too much value way too quickly. But still, the point stands that there's this very concrete way of evaluating systems, which is, is it positively economic? Does it capture more value? Yeah. And then you can say, like, okay, well, Solana, yes, it leaks value. It inflates. But look what you get from that inflation. You get, like, super strong ux. You get instant transaction finality. You get, like, insane throughput. And so, yes, like, Solana is not positively economic now, but what it is now is fantastic ux. But I would still call that like a second order fundamentals. Does that make sense?"

        "text": "This probably comes from, you know, bitcoin where. Bitcoin network and the bitcoin asset, they're much more like, singularly unified. Because, I mean, previously, for a very long time, until we had all of the NFTs and BRC twenties that are being spun up on bitcoin, there were no apps. The only app was sending bitcoin from one person to another. That was the only app. And so bitcoin, the network and bitcoin, the asset were kind of synonymous. When we get into a smart contract world and chains like ethereum or chains like avalanche or Solana or any of these cosmos, you can have a disconnect between the network and the value that is created on the network for users and the value accrual mechanisms of the token themselves. So the token is not the network and the network is not the token. I think this is an important investor take in general. Again, maybe not in the early stages, but in the later stages of things, you can have a network that creates so much value for the world. I think of networks like, you know, like Napster, for instance, like peer to peer file sharing, a lot of, like, quote unquote value was created. Did any of those on the periphery?"

And, like, I feel like I have a framework for understanding that, like, you know, monetary premium primarily, like, reservation demand is basically all. And then, okay, why is ether going to exhibit value accrual at all? Well, you got monetary premium, but it's also a capital asset, right? So it's actually throwing off cash. And so, like, I just apply that same framework to other layer one assets. And anyway, just because the network. The network could be absolutely fantastic. And, like, I think it's fantastic that TrON is being used in the way that it's being used to make people more bankless. I think that, like, cosmos in the way that it's being used is fantastic. I think that Solana is also fantastic to the extent that people are using these apps and these are experiences. Well, but the question is, will the token accrue value? One reason I actually, like jettisoned from the Cosmos community was like, I didn't see the value accrual around the atom token. And, like, to be honest, I still don't. So nothing against cosmos. Like, it's fantastic. I just don't understand how the investment is good. And sometimes I think people put both hats on the same time in that. Are you saying the Solana network is bad or it doesn't have fundamentals? No, the network can have fantastic UX and fundamental all of these things. The question in the episode we were trying to answer yesterday was like, well, how does value accrual work? And I still have a lot of questions on that story for Solana. Does that make sense?"

It's like the floor is transaction fee revenue, and Solana is like, the guy who's not touching the floor. The bankless take on this. The me and you take is like, you need transaction fee revenue to be sustainable. If we want our blockchains to stand this test of time, they need to be positively economic. And then if you go and scroll down, you'll find Solana community members seeing, wow, David's dunking on Ethereum. Kind of like flipping it on its head. Because transaction fee revenue to many in the Solana world is extraction. This idea of a positively economic blockchain is synonymous with extraction from its user base. At least that's part of one of the shards of the Solana narrative that many people are coming out there. It's one of the same muddling of the investment case for Solana and the application layer for Solana. These things can be bullish separately, you can be bullish on the Solana app layer because it's minimum viable extraction. And if you believe that, that's great, because then applications get to use Solana. They could have super fast transactions, or everything is subsidized. But then using that same argument to say, and therefore Sol token is bullish is missing a link here. Because the Sol token is specifically subsidizing the value of the application. It's a transfer of the value capture of the Sol token to the value produced by the Solana application layer app. And you get to say, well, the token is still going to go up in price because all the apps are built on Solana.

So it's just like this monetary premium category. And to me, that's like the narrative category, the meme category. Bitcoin has this, ethereum has this, and it is the hardest piece to value.

They've got, you know, parallel fee markets, right? Like local fee markets, parallelization. And they've been doing the execution thing that ethereum has been like, what are we going to do?

It's one of the best wallets come out of the community. The Phantom wallet. Fantastic user experience. Right? It feels very good to get a transaction through and to pay, like, micro fractions of a cent and to do many of the things that the Ethereum, like the original Ethereum vision promised. Collateralized lending, trading of perps. It all feels very defi, and it feels like you're doing this without kind of a binance or centralized exchange. You're holding your own private keys. So people are saying that and they're like, okay, but this is here and now. And by the way, it has these aspirations and promises to massively, like, the monolithic chain strategy or the integrated chain strategy is like a strategy about fantastic UX for users. And is it back to the suzu, like, Ethereum has abandoned its users type of. It's that kind of take, I think. And I don't think that's an unfair take."

And from one angle, Ethereum is approaching it from a different angle, and Solana is approaching it from the last angle. Right. And I think it's you and me. We came into crypto in a moment where Ethereum kind of really set our vision for the world, for this industry and the Ethereum perspective. Have you come in to the scalability trilemma you start with and do not compromise on decentralization, and then you figure out how to get the others, whereas Solana is coming in? Well, we're going to start with scale and we're going to figure out how."

        "text": "System, as a bd strategy. Great killing. It works. Has already been working. The whole narrative around Solana is absolutely fantastic right now. It's deafening in the fullness of time. And this was my point to Mike, I'm sure you remember in the fullness of time where you elect to start on the scalability trilemma and the thing that you enshrine is critically important, and then you'll try and get the others determines in the wholeness of time what your system looks like at completion. And so Solana, which compromised on decentralization in the hopes of gaining it later, will look like a system that compromised on decentralization and tried to get it later. Ethereum is a system that did not compromise on decentralization, but tried to get scalability layer later. And then in the fullness of time it will look like that. And maybe these systems really look very similar to each other, but the path dependency is critically important right now. Ethereum has to like figure out bridging and a chain abstraction. Solana doesn't have to do that because it's monolithic. Solana has to figure out decentralization. The problem that I see Solana running into is it's got its high inflation rate of Solana. At the same time that is in a network infancy phase. I would prefer a network that would have a higher inflation rate while it didn't have a smaller set of actors than it would once have in the future. Because if you combine high proof of stake inflation with a low set of ecosystem participants, then you have the inflation going to an early set of adopters that become difficult to un enshrine. You're accidentally formally enshrined, the early set of people because you compromise on decentralization. So I guess really the conversation is like, which is the easier problem to solve? Ethereum has decentralization solved, Solana doesn't. Solana has ux solved, Ethereum doesn't. Which is the easier problem?"

And I think this is bankless. Citizen Scott Connor, who we're talking to in discord, made this take on Twitter. What we are market testing now is how valuable decentralization actually is. And then he goes on and says, ethereum has one definition of decentralization. Solana has a slightly different definition of decentralization. This goes to the point that we were making the other episode where to me, it's not so much about the feature set of decentralization. We can now move towards how coercion, corruption resistant is your protocol. Look at, you know, do OFAC sanctioned transactions actually make it through? But I think he has a valid point here. It's like, how much do users care about decentralization? And that, that is the, at some level, that's the meta test of crypto, right? Like, what is bitcoin? It's a big decentralized consensus database. How, how much do people care about that? Well, what's the value of bitcoin right now? You know what I mean? Like, the entire crypto experiment is finding out some value proposition for decentralization, and, like, you're letting the market. So at some level, it's not about you and I saying, like, we'd prefer that Solana did it this way or some other chain did it this way. And like, that's the way Ethereum is doing it. It's not up to us, it's up to the market. And I recall a conversation that you and I had recently with Chris Berniske, and he was basically like, guys, you have to be comfortable with the new cohort of people that join crypto, not sharing the values that you have."

That's you and I, David, on crypto Twitter. And in the show, I know they get triggered and are eth maxis for life, but it's coming off pretty unprofessional and childish. No reason. Both can't exist and succeed in their own right. We all survived the last bull. Let's try to bring more positivity into crypto. I appreciate more coverage of Solana and the pod, but it seems impossible for either of them to just say any positive. Anything positive. Y'all talk smack, basically. Is it? Let me. Let me just say something positive about Solana. More private keys and more hands. Fantastic. Fantastic. Better user experience onboarding more people to crypto. Fantastic.
