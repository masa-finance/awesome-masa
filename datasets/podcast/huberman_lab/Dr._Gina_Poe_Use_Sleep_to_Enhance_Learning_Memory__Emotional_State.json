        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Gina Poe. Doctor Gina Poe is a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning. In particular, how specific patterns of brain activity that are present during specific phases of sleep impact our ability to learn and remember specific types of information, for instance, procedural information, that is, how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks, as well as encoding of emotional memories and discarding emotional memories. Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep can act as its own form of trauma therapy, discarding the emotional tones of memories. In addition, her laboratory focuses on how specific phases of sleep impact things like the release of growth hormone. Growth hormone, of course, plays critical roles in metabolism and tissue repair, including brain tissue repair, and therefore has critical roles in vitality and longevity. Today, you will learn many things about the relationship between sleep, learning, emotionality, and growth hormone. One basic but very important takeaway that you'll learn about today, which was news to me, is that it's not just the duration and depth of your sleep that matter, but actually getting to sleep at relatively the same time each night ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release in the first hours of sleep. In fact, if you require, let's say 8 hours of sleep per night, but you go to sleep 2 hours later than your typical bedtime on any given night, you actually miss the window for growth hormone release. That's right, getting growth hormone release and sleep, which is absolutely critical to our immediate and long term health, is not a prerequisite of getting sleep, even if we are getting enough sleep. As Doctor Poe explains, there are critical brain circuits and endocrine, that is, hormone circuits that regulate not just the duration and depth and quality and timing of sleep, but when we place our bout of sleep, that is, when we go to sleep each night, plus or minus about a half hour or so, strongly dictates whether or not we will experience all the health promoting, including mind promoting, benefits of sleep. Today's episode covers that and a lot more in substantial detail. You will learn, for instance, how to use sleep in order to optimize learning as well as forgetting for those things that you would like to forget. So during today's episode, Doctor Gina Poe shares critical information about not just neuroscience, but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain. And body that strongly inform mental health, physical health and performance. So by the end of today's episode, you'll be far more informed about sleep and how it works, the different roles it performs. And you'll have several new actionable steps that you can take in order to improve your mental health, physical health and performance. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium, the so called electrolytes, and no sugar. Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios. And we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinklimentlmnt.com hubermandhenne and now for my discussion with doctor Gina Poe. Doctor Gina Poe, welcome."

So to start things off, I would love for you to educate us a bit about this thing that we are all familiar with and yet very few of us understand, which is sleep. And if you would, could you describe the various phases of sleep that exist, what distinguish them? And perhaps frame this within the context of what would a perfect night's sleep look like? Okay, how long would it last, more or less? And what would the biology look like? What is a perfect night's sleep?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Oh, yeah, that's a great question. All right, so sleep is really different from wakefulness, and, in fact, can't be replaced by any state of wakefulness that we've been able to come up with so far. Our brain chemistry is completely different. And in the different stages of sleep, which there are non rem and rem are the two major states of sleep. And every animal we've studied so far seems to have both of those states anyway. Those two states are entirely different from one another, too. And even within non rem, there are three states. Stage one, which is what you slip into when you first falling asleep, dozing. There's kind of an interesting rhythm that goes on in the brain. It's kind of a fast gamma rhythm. And then there's stage two, which is a really cool state. We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers because it was a transient state between wakefulness and the deep. Stage three, slow wave sleep, which is the most impressively different, and between that and rem sleep. So stage two, I'll talk a little bit more about. And then the deep, slow wave sleep state, which is when big, slow waves sweep through our brain. And now we realize that it cleans our brain. One of the things that those big, slow waves do is cleans our brain and does other really important things to restore us from a day of wakefulness. And then REM sleep, which is the most popular because that's where we have the most active dreams. And when you wake up someone out of REM sleep, they'll almost always report having dreamed something really bizarre. That's called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. So those are the four states of sleep, of human sleep, and we cycle through them every 90 minutes or so. When we go to sleep, say 1010 30, 11:00, our first REM sleep period comes about 105 minutes after we fall asleep and lasts about 20 minutes. Actually, it comes about 95 minutes and lasts ten or 15 minutes. And then we start over again, and we have about five of those per night for a perfect night's sleep. Four or five, something like that. So a perfect night's sleep is seven, one, two, 8 hours. There was a really great study that put people in a semi darkened room with nothing but the bed for 12 hours every day for a month. And what people did initially, because we're in a sleep deprived nation is that they slept a lot more than usual, like ten or 11 hours of the twelve, and then they leveled off after a week or two to about 8 hours and 15 minutes of sleep. So you actually can't oversleep. I mean, they had nothing else to do but sleep and they would round off to, on average, 8 hours and 15 minutes a night and then spend the rest of the time twiddling their thumbs, humming tunes. Interesting. Daydreaming."

I'm often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep and whether or not sleeping too long, excuse me, can make us groggy the next day. Is there anything to that? And how does one determine how long they should sleep? On average?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "On average, yeah. Well, that's interesting because different people seem to need different amounts of sleep, but we don't really even know exactly what sleep is for. So what they need is kind of. It's murky. So we do know a lot of things that sleep does now for us, but we don't know how long those things take. How long we need to sleep is also just a big question mark. But some people don't feel rested until they've slept 9 hours. Some people don't feel rested after three or four and a half. But most people, if they consistently deprive themselves of sleep so that they're only sleeping four, four and a half hours a night, build up a cognitive deficit that just builds up over time. The more nights you have with sleep deprivation, the more cognitive deficit you have. And so you need sleep again to sleep more, to recover. Now the question you had about can you oversleep? Can you oversleep? Right?"

Growing up, when I was in high school, my girlfriend's dad had this belief that no one should sleep in past 06:00 a.m. so he would wake all the. There were two children in that home. He would wake up the kids in that house. He had this thing against oversleeping regardless of when people went to sleep. And I always thought that was an interesting mentality."

        "text": "It's not terrible because what that will do is it'll make you sleepier the next night to get to bed on time. So it'll build up your homeostatic need if you wake up too early. I don't think you can oversleep, but people who sleep a lot, like people who sleep over 9 hours, it's probably indicative of some other problem, because, in fact, if you have a lot of different conditions, it will cause you to sleep a lot more, probably because what it does is it interferes with your efficiency. Sleep the efficiency of your sleep. So if you find yourself sleeping consistently 9 hours plus every night, then you might want to consult a doctor about maybe what else it might be. It could be cancer. It could be sleep apnea. That affects a lot of people. It could be that your sleep is super inefficient because you're snoring a lot more than you know, or you're waking up a lot more than you know every night. So you might want to sleep study just to see how your sleep is and then see what else might be causing you to sleep so much."

        "text": "So although I don't know, there was really something to these red pills. So shout out to the acupuncturists and the eastern medicine. But to return to this idea of the architecture of a perfect night's sleep. So you said we fall asleep the first 90 minutes of sleep. Rem sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, will arrive at about 95 minutes in. Does that mean that the rest of that 90 minutes is consumed with slow wave sleep?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, non rem sleep."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And what about the sleep where we are lightly asleep and we might have a dream that has us somehow thinking about movement or that we jolt ourselves awake? That often happens early in the night, right?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, that's the first stage, stage one and stage two of sleep. And stage two, sleep is really cool because that has something called sleep spindles and k complexes. And what sleep spindles are a little of activity that's ten to 15 hz in frequency. It's a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex. The thalamus is the gateway to consciousness, and the neocortex processes all our cognition. And so it's these spindles. They're called sleep spindles. And if you wake up out of that state, you will often report a dream, like a hallucination style dream. It won't be a long dream report like you have out of REM sleep, but it will be some hallucination state while we're falling asleep. One of the reasons we call it falling asleep is because in stage one and stage two, our muscles are relaxing. And if there's part of our brain that's conscious enough to sort of recognize that relaxation, we'll feel like we're falling and we'll jerk awake so often, that hallucination, it's called hypnagogic hallucination, will feel like it'll include some falling aspect that we'll wake up out of."

        "text": "Yeah. There's a little bit on body position and sleep and some of the washout that we'll talk about so early in the night. You got these lighter stages of sleep, less rapid eye movement sleep. What can we say about the dreams that occur during the, say, first and second 90 minutes cycles of sleep. Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, okay, that's an interesting question. There's a lot of facets to it. There is some evidence that the first 4 hours of sleep are very important for memory processing. And in fact, if you've learned something new that day or have experienced a new sensorimotor experience, then your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience much more than the later sleep dreams later. As that memory gets consolidated from the early structures, which are the hippocampus deep and the temporal lobe, to the cortex in a distributed fashion, that memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the cortex. And also the dreams that incorporate that memory also move later in the night. So nobody knows why, but there was a great study. Bye. Siddharto Ribeiro, who studied the consolidation of memories from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat across the period of a full day's sleep, because rats sleep in the daytime. And he found that each subsequent REm sleep period moved that memory from the hippocampus to the first area that projects to it, and then the second area and then the third area. And you can see the memory moving throughout the sleep period. Yeah, very cool."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So I have to read that study. So there's a number of different hormones associated with the different stages of sleep. We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime, of nighttime that makes us sleepy. What about growth hormone release? When does that occur? During sleep?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So growth hormone release happens all day long and all night long. But the deep, slow wave sleep that you get, the very first sleep cycle, is when you get a big bolus of growth hormone release in men and women equally. And if you miss that first deep, slow wave sleep period, you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release. And you might get ultimately across the day just as much overall growth hormone release. But endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses do different things than a little bit eked out over time. So that is what we know. There's also a big push to synthesize proteins. So that's when the protein synthesis part that builds memories, for example, in our brain happens in that first cycle of sleep. So you don't want to miss that, especially if you've learned something really big and needs more synaptic space to encode it."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So, so let's say I normally go to sleep at 10:00 p.m. and then from ten to 1130 would be this first phase of sleep, and that's when the growth hormone, big bolus of growth hormone would be released. Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead at 1130 or midnight, that I miss that first phase of sleep? Why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep just simply starting later?"

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body that knows when things should happen. And it's every cell in our body has a clock, and all those clocks are normally synchronized, and those circadian clocks are synchronized. And so our cells are ready to respond to that growth hormone release at a particular time. And if we miss it, and it's a time in relation to melatonin also. So if you miss it, yeah, you might get some growth hormone release, but it's occurring at a time when that your clock has already moved to the next phase. And so it's just a clock thing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. I don't think we can overstate the importance of what you just described. And to be honest, despite knowing a bit about the sleep research in circadian biology, this is the very first time that I've ever heard this, that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep, that you can't simply initiate your sleep bout later and expect to capture that first phase of sleep. That's incredible, and I think important, and as many listeners are probably realizing, also highly actionable. So what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bedtimes in addition to fairly consistent wake times. Is that right?"

People that sleep 9 hours or more, perhaps that reflecting an issue, some underlying issue perhaps, is being a teenager or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of development where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth. An exception to that, because I don't recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager. I had a ton of energy. But I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot. Like, they'll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep. Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep, let them sleep? Okay, so that's the one exception."

I mean, sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and making it develop. Right. And if we deprive ourselves of sleep, we will actually also, just like I said, we have a daily clock. We also have a developmental clock, and we can miss a developmental window if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to."

In other words, if I go to sleep religiously every night at 10:00 p.m. are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours of the preceding day, like ingest caffeine or alcohol? That can make that first stage of sleep less effective, even if I'm going to sleep at the same time?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Alcohol definitely will do that, because alcohol is a rem sleep suppressant, and it even suppresses some of that stage two transition to REM with those sleep spindles and those sleep spindles. We didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important for moving memories to our cortex. It's a unique time when our hippocampus, sort of like the ram of our brains, writes it to a hard disk, which is the cortex, and it's a unique time when they're connected. So if you don't want to miss that, you don't want to miss REM sleep, which is also a part of a consolidation process and schema changing process. And alcohol in there before we go to sleep, we'll do that until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies. It will affect our sleep badly."

But other hormones are picking up. It is a really different stage that you also don't want to short change yourself on. And I think that's the stage. Many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep when the most creativity can happen. That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into a new way. And our schema are built during that time. So, yeah, we can change our minds best during those phases of sleep."

In the northern hemisphere. It's cold. We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells, even things that are false that we normally associate with Christmas presents, family gathering. When it is, all of this stuff is sewn together into one. There's a thread linking them all, and we can just give ourselves a list of words, and none of them contain the word Christmas, and then ask people later, give them another list of words and include the word Christmas. And they'll say, oh yeah, that word was there because in their minds, they brought up that word Christmas because it's part of that whole schema. So that's what it's sort of a lot of related concepts, I guess."

Is that one way to think of it?"

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Exactly. No, that's a great way to think of it. And when you're in REM sleep, in the later parts of the night and that transition to REM, that's when your computer of your brain is opening folders and comparing documents, seeing if is there anything the same. These two documents look very much the same, but there's a little bit of difference, and it can link those conceptually. So that that's probably one of the origins of creativity, is finding things that are related, maybe just linked a little bit, and you can find that link and strengthen it. If it makes your schema interesting and different."

I've tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep. I've heard also that the impulse to urinate. I forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this. So the impulse to urinate is also dictated by how quickly you drink fluid, not just the total volume. So I've switched to sipping fluids more slowly for my last beverage of the day, which seems to help. The point here is that I think a lot of people wake up once in the middle of the night, oftentimes to use the restroom, but oftentimes just around 03:00 a.m. and might be up for a few minutes, hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright light, which can cause more wakefulness, but then go back to sleep. Is there any known detriment to this middle of the night waking, or should we consider it a normal feature for some people's sleep architecture?"

So don't worry about it. It's absolutely normal to wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and as long as you can get back to sleep in a reasonable amount of time, or even if it takes you an hour, don't worry about it. As long as you have a lifestyle that allows you to then make up that sleep either the next morning or the next night, going to bed a little earlier."

But in fact, if you give someone a non threatening kind of stimulation, like somebody dropping keys or a ping or something like that, instead of waking, that same volume will wake someone up out of non REM sleep, but out of REM sleep and instead lengthen the amount of time or make it even more dense, your rapid eye movements more dense.

It's kind of a toss up because it's really hard to wake them up out of that deep, slow wave sleep. And in fact, fire alarms don't wake them up, even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep. So that's why they're trying to change fire alarms.

I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D three k two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com hubermanda to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D, three k two.

And so different from sleep walking, which is out of slow wave sleep, out of slow wave sleep, that sleepwalking is a mixture between sleep and wakefulness. So you actually will respond to the door. You can cook a full meal, drive your car while you're in deep, slow way sleep. Scary, because you never know what you're going to do. You don't have voluntary control over it, you have no conscious control over it. But you can actually safely navigate some situations in sleepwalking and actually have a conversation. Although it may not make much sense when you're sleep talking, in REM sleep, you're not processing the outside world, and instead, when you're acting out your dreams, you could be doing things like walking through a place glass window or falling off of, you know, down the stairs, things like that.

That is, if you set your alarm for halfway through one of these 90 minutes cycles that come late in the night of sleep, that it can lead to rather groggy patterns of waking.

But one of the reasons why we have such a grogginess, it's called sleep inertia. When we wake up out of the wrong state, which is deep, slow wave sleep, is because I liken it to like a washing machine cycle. This 90 minutes cycle is like a washing machine cycle, and the first part is to add water. Right. And then your clothes are soaking wet. You don't want to open the washing machine and try and function, put them on and wear them around while they're soaking wet and full of soap. So you have to wait until the cycle is through before you can. Well, actually, let's put it in the dryer too, before you want to wear them. So, yeah, you can function. It just takes a little while for those clothes, that brain to dry out. So you can actually function well, but it's better to wait through. The whole cycle is complete. And so that's why you want to set that 90 minutes alarm clock. And again, that's around 90 minutes, because the first stage of sleep, the first cycle of sleep is actually a little longer, more like 100, 510 minutes. But then the second ones and third ones, they get sort of shorter and shorter as the night goes on. And in the last few cycles, you're just doing the n two REM sleep cycle, which takes less time. And if you wake up out of REm sleep, there's usually no problem. Cognitively, you're good to go."

But a colleague of mine at Stanford, Allie Crumb, who works on mindset and belief effects, talked to me about a study they did where people often will bias their sense of daytime wakefulness based on their sleep score more than their subjective score. In other words, if they were told they got a poor night's sleep, even if they got a great night's sleep, and this was, of course, measured in the sleep lab, so they were able to compare, people report feeling more groggy. And the opposite is also true, that if it says 100% or 90% on your sleep score, then people go, oh, I feel great, even though they might not have slept well. So this speaks to the, I don't want to say placebo effect, but the sort of belief effects that are woven in with a score. So it seems to me that combining subjective and objective data is probably best."

And that's because probably we just came out with a paper that shows that subcortical structures can be in a completely different sleep state than cortical structures, which is what we measure in the sleep lab, what the cortex is doing. So it might be that people who say, I did not sleep all night long, even though the cortex is saying, oh, no, you had great sleep, was because they're monitoring their subcortical hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, other structures that the sleep lab just can't access.

But there's hope, because, in fact, it would be great. I think that's possible from the paper. If you look at it. It's in Pnas this year that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG that might be able to tell you what the subcortical structures are doing. Things like the abnormality power in that sleep spindle band, that sigma band would change if the hippocampus is in rem sleep and the cortex is in that sleep spindle state and vice versa. So there is some hope that we can gain from people with depth electrodes or animals with depth electrodes that we could backwards machine learn what the cortex might be able to tell us about subcortical structures from the cortical eeg."

There's one more thing I wanted to ask about the architecture of the night sleep in terms of early part of the night. Earlier you mentioned the washouthe of debris and the so called glymphatic system, I think is what you're referring to. Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout that occurs in the brain during sleep, what that is and what roles it's thought to serve, and perhaps if there are any ways to ensure that it happens or to ensure that it doesn't happen. And obviously we want this to happen."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, yeah. All right, great question. We talked about the circadian clock and how certain things happen at certain times. Well, one of the things that happens when we're awake and talking to each other is that there's a lot of plasticity. There's something that I'm learning from you today and you're learning from me, and that changes our synapses and it changes the way our proteins are going to be folded and changed during sleep. It unfolds. This process actually uses a lot of ATP, the power structure, the fuel of the brain, and it unfolds also proteins while we're doing this, while we're using them. And so during that first part of the night, when we first fall asleep, in the first 20 minutes or so, we're building that adenosine back into ATP. And that's probably why power naps are called power naps, because we're actually rebuilding the power. And then we're also cleaning out through the deep, slow waves of slow wave sleep. We're cleaning out all those misfolded proteins, unfolded proteins and other things that get broken down and need to be rebuilt when we're asleep because of its use during wakefulness. So I liken that to having a big party during wakefulness, and you need all those partygoers to leave in order to do the cleanup. And so what I think the mechanism is, and this is still something to be tested, is actually slow waves themselves, which is bad news for us as we get older and those slow waves get smaller and slowly sleep goes away. So what happens when a neuron is firing is that it expands. The membrane expands a little bit, it becomes more translucent. That's how we know, one of the ways we know that neurons expand when they fire. And so every action potential, the membrane expands a little bit as sodium brings water into the cell. And then when they're silent, they contracted. And so during slow waves, the cool thing is that the reason why you can measure them is that all the neurons at the same time, not all of them, but a good portion of them, are firing at the same time and silent at the same time. And so you think about that as contracting and expanding all at the same time. It's kind of like a bilge pump of the brain. So that can pump out glia are also really important for this in terms of. Of cleaning up debris and transferring it to where it needs to go. So I think of it actually as a bilge pump cleaning out our brain."

The cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through. But here you're talking about literally an expansion and a contraction of the neurons in unison and pushing the fluid through, cleaning out any misfolded proteins or debris that might occur on the basis of these metabolic pathways. And the consequence of that is to what? To leave the brain in a state of more pristine action for the next day. Is that right?"

And the night owl, there's almost like a night owl posse out there, especially on social media. They get very upset when you say that you should see morning sunlight, that after 10:00 a.m. you kind of miss the boat.

I'd love for you to tell us about rem sleep and the sleep later in the night as it relates to dreams and emotionality. And this is probably the appropriate time for you to introduce us to this incredible structure in the brain, which is the locus ceruleus. A difficult structure to spell, but a beautifully named structure. I find locus ceruleans to be just fascinating, and I know, I know a small fraction of what it does, and I'm hoping you're going to educate me and our audience more about what it does and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship to epinephrine. Aka adrenaline."

Yeah, and I mean every other animal with a brain, because of course there are animals with nervous systems that are not centralized, like jellyfish. But anyway, we're digressing there. So the locus coerulus is filled with neurons that have in them norepinephrine, which is the brain's version of epinephrine, or adrenaline. It's also called noradrenaline. And what it does is it just like adrenaline in the rest of our bodies, it helps prime us to respond to our environment. So when locus rules, neurons fire and fire in a burst, we can switch our attention, and they will fire in a burst. If, for example, a loud noise happens in the middle of your concentrating on something, so you can, it helps, it fires and it helps you switch your attention to that thing and then learn quickly from it. So it's really important in a stress response. It helps us do quick one trial learning, and then tonic activity during the day when you're just doing normal, going about your normal concentration kind of activities, is really good for sustained attention. It works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain, which is really important for learning and memory, also help us learn about things and put things together. But just tonica levels are signature of wakefulness and alertness. So too much is panic. With the locuserillis activity, a burst is switching attention, and then tonic levels are sustained, constant attention. And then when we go to sleep, the locus coerulus slows and goes from about, on average, 2, about 1 cycle per second tonically. And then when we go into REM sleep, it's the only time when it shuts off completely. And it appears that that complete silence is really, really important for a number of things. And the main thing that I think it's important for is the ability to erase and break down synapses that are no longer working for us. So they encode things that are false now, or they are encoding things that we learned in the novelty encoding pathways of our brain that have now been consolidated to other pathways. And so we need to now erase them from the novelty encoding pathway. And that is really, really important for being able to continue to learn things all of our lives. So like erasing that Ram or that, I don't know, what do you call those discs that you stick into computers?"

But it's really important when we're learning something new, to also release dopamine, or to at least activate the dopaminergic receptors in our hippocampus. So, yeah, so dopamine, norepinephrine, and then there's also galenin, which is important for releasing when we're stressed. And it helps also with that rapid learning. It works in concert with norepinephrine and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses so that we learn really quickly."

The glia, the neuropeptides, the neurotransmitters, the physical structure of synapses. And so when I was going through grad school 35 years ago, the dogma was that every neuron contains one neurotransmitter and releases one neurotransmitter. And you had excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibitory neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory neurotransmitters but that's as complicated as got. And then we started talking about neuropeptides, and people said, oh, no, please don't. Don't complicate it. And then we started talking about how neurons contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and maybe more than one neurotransmitter, maybe even hormones, too. Hormones. And, oh, lord, you know, it's just so complicated. But gotta admit, that's why it works, right? And every time the brain teaches us something new about itself that we didn't hypothesize, we say, oh, of course that wouldn't work if the way I hypothesized it with it, you know, we actually need redundancy.

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So, a lot of this is hypothetical, but based on a lot of good evidence that we're sewing together into a schema from which these hypotheses come. So, a model schema from which these hypotheses come. One thing that happens to people with post traumatic stress disorder is that there is a lot of evidence that the locus coerulus doesn't stop firing in REm sleep. So, whereas their levels of norepinephrine might be similar to people without PTSD during the day and even during the first part of the night, during the wee hours of the morning. And when you measure norepinephrine levels from metabolites in the blood or the cerebral spinal fluid, you see that people with PTSD, it's during the wee hours of the morning when you have the most rem sleep that they have. Their norepinephrine levels differentiate most from those that don't have PTSD. And so that's evidence that the locuserillis is not shutting down during REm sleep like it should. Other evidence is heart rate variability. When our locusorillus is firing, our heart rates are generally a little higher, and they don't vary as much as they do when the locus pirilis is not firing during slow wave sleep, normally have this big juicy variability in heart rate with every breath in and breath out. Because our noradrenergic levels, our norepinephrine levels are lower during REM sleep, that goes away entirely, and our heart rate is dominated by parasympathetic rather than sympathetic activity. And also what our brain is driving. What are we dreaming about? For example, if we're dreaming, we're running, our heart rates will go up, but norepinephrine levels still should be low or off. People with PTSD that noradrenergics, we're studying these in rats too. Is it true that our locustrellis doesn't shut off when we have post traumatic stress disorder? And the preliminary evidence is, yes, it's true that it doesn't shut off. So what that would do is norepinephrine would act at synapses, is to prevent that weakening that you really need, for example, of novelty encoding structures. And it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure even once it's consolidated to the rest of the brain. So in the hippocampus, which is important for remembering things throughout our lives, and it's that thumb drive, we need it to be erased so that we can learn new things once it's been consolidated to the hard drive of our cortex. And so if we're not able to do that, we fill up that ram really quickly or that thumb dive really quickly, and we're not able to learn new things. So, for example, after a trauma, I talked to all the locustarillas responding in stressful situations. That's great, it's very adaptive. But then you need it to stop. Once you've learned what you need to learn from it and you want to go to sleep, you need the locus rilus to calm down. And during rem sleep you want it to stop, because then when you've consolidated that traumatic memory to the cortex. You need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures, for example, in the hippocampus, so that then when you're in the context of safety, you can learn those new things, those new contexts, and stop responding to those same stimuli as though you're in that original situation. So if you're not able to erase that thumb drive, you will always feel like that trauma happened that same day, like earlier that same day, and respond as you would to an early recent trauma, which is with beating heart and all of that. So even memories that are years past, if you're never able to downscale that novelty encoding structure and purge it from that traumatic memory, it will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive."

And for that matter, what things can cause ramping up of locus coeruleus during this phase of sleep? We've had a couple podcast episodes, solo episodes, and with guests talking about trauma. We had Doctor Paul Conti, who's a Stanford trained, Harvard trained psychiatrist who talked a lot about trauma, wrote an excellent book on trauma, and certainly sleep was emphasized as a key thing, like get enough sleep. But here you're saying even if somebody with trauma gets enough sleep, if locus coeruleus is hyperactive during sleep, those traumas are going to persist. And most of the trauma treatments that I'm aware of are everything ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy, talk therapy, drug therapy, EmDR, hypnosis. Nowadays, there's a lot of interest and attention on clinical studies on exploring psychedelics, high dose psilocybin and MDMA. So it's a vast landscape, none of which, as far as I know, is really focused on sleep specifically."

So, yeah, so much to talk about here. Antidepressants are often noradrenergic or serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, so they leave norepinephrine actually out there in the synapses. And what that does is it inhibits REM sleep. And if you are able to get REM sleep, it would probably be REM sleep with some noradrenergic activity, I think. Anyway, I'm not a physician that antidepressants are counter indicated. You don't want to take them. If you've experienced a trauma and you're experiencing PTSD, because if anything, it's going to make it worse or at least prevent the type of adaptive REM sleep that you really need in order to resolve those emotions and move on."

But the dorsal raphe nucleus, which produces serotonin, which the serotonin specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors block from being reuptaken, leaves too much serotonin out there. And what serotonin also is another neurodrenergic. I'm sorry, another neurotransmitter that's downregulated during REM sleep that's specifically off during REM sleep. And what serotonin does is it weights all of our cognition to being able to recognize novelty again. So it sort of weights our brain away from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty. And it might be one reason why it's an effective antidepressant, because it makes the world feel fresh and new again. Right. But when you have a. Too much, you're holding a novel traumatic memory in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already. You don't want to, again, weight things toward novelty. You need that absence of serotonin also to help you get that sense of familiarity and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures. So you need both to be absent."

And what you just described accuse me to something that Doctor Paul Conti and others have said in terms of trauma, and here I'm paraphrasing. So my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right, that an effective treatment for trauma does not erase the traumatic memory, but it causes a transition of what once was disturbing and invasive and maladaptive to eventually just become kind of a boring old story that has kind of a fuzzy texture to it, as opposed to this kind of sharp, high friction texture that invades our thinking and obviously, our sleeping states as well. So, again, and I appreciate the disclaimer, the caveats around not being a clinician, et cetera. But I do think that there's a lot of interest now in whether or not antidepressants are effective for trauma or not. And I think these aspects of neuromodulation as they relate to, let's call it erasing traumas or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep is something important to take note. We also have a lot of clinicians that listen to of this podcast, so they should also take note, please. So if I want to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released from locus coeruleus during rapid eye movement sleep to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories and allow late stages of sleep each night to have their maximum positive effect, is there anything that I can do besides avoiding avoiding traumas, avoiding serotonergic or noradrenergic compounds?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I would also avoid anything just prior to going to sleep that might excite those systems. So a lot of novelty, a lot of exciting, stress inducing video games, try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can. So maybe deep breathing exercises, that's a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic fight or flight system, is deep breathing. And we haven't been able to test this with rats because we can't ask them to do a deep breathing exercise. There might be a way we can do that, but I haven't found out or figured it out yet. But if there's a way you can make your sympathetic system, nervous system calm down before you go to sleep might free for you meditation or deep breathing exercise. It might be for some a warm bath or a comforting book. Nothing too exciting, but also nothing too boring. Perhaps just something right in the middle which makes you feel happy and calm, is what you should do. And if you instead go to sleep while you're anxious or you're hyped up, then your sleep could become maladaptive. Another thing that happens in rats that we have yet to know if it happens in women, is that female rats have three phases of their estrus cycle, that their locustrulis doesn't seem to calm down during REM sleep as much, and we don't know why. But during the high estrogen phases of their estrus cycle, the locustrullis shuts down just like it does in male rats. But in the other three phases it doesn't. One thing that might work, and in fact there are a few studies that show it could work really well, is giving women after a trauma event something that contains estrogen. Because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD. And they know that through retrospective studies where they gave women an emergency room, either a pill without estrogen or without, and those that had the pill with estrogen in it were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma, as measured a year later, than those that had the pill without. So there are some really good studies by Bronwyn Graham, she's out of Australia, to really hone in on how much estrogen do you need? And also testosterone, just so you know, gets converted to estrogen in the brain. So testosterone also can be protective because it gets converted to estrogen. But there's something about estrogen that's really helpful and protective about from the high locusyrillis firing. And this is, again, preliminary data that we don't have full. We don't have all the answers yet, and we are looking into it actively right now, but it's really important. The other thing about women is that we are two to four times more susceptible to anxiety related mental health disorders, including post traumatic stress disorder. So if we could figure out what's happening to the locuserialists during sleep in women and then figure out a way to normalize that. So the locuserilless is silent when it needs to be silent, I think we could go a long way in helping women be more resilient to stress related disorders."

But what we have found, which actually largely replicated a study in 1960, is that women, or females, rather, at high estrogen, high hormonal phases of their estrus cycle or menstrual cycle, sleep a lot less, but that sleep is more efficient, so that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles, which I haven't gone into what they might do, except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex. But those sleep spindles are more dense and more coherent across the brain areas. The theta cycle, which is five to 10 hz in the hippocampus, important for one year learning and also important during REm sleep, is also bigger and juicier during the high hormonal phases. So even though there's less sleep, it's more efficient and better. But so all of that efficiency seems to be reduced in those other hormonal phases. So even though you might sleep a little more, you might need more sleep, in fact, in order to accomplish the same thing that you can get with that short, very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases."

I'm very happy that you mentioned trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep and some ways to do that. I'm a big fan, and I've talked a lot before on this podcast about things like Yoga Nidra, which is a non movement based practice, sometimes called non sleep depressed, where people actually take some time each day to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic, aka relaxed state, deliberately because it's a bit of a skill. And there's some good data, really, mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia showing huge increases in nigrostriatal dopamine, when people basically engage in a practice of deliberate non movement, and that the brain actually enters states of a very shallow sleep, sort of nap ish. But the idea is to actually stay awake, but motionless. And it does seem to restore a certain number of features of neurochemistry. But perhaps more importantly, it teaches people to relax, which is something that most people are not very good at. But in any event, and people who listen to this podcast have heard me say this over and over again, so I sound like a broken record. But this practice as a zero cost practice that doesn't require any pharmacology, does seem to really enhance people's ability to fall asleep more quickly and to fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night. So in any event, another plug for NSDR, yoga Nidra."

That's one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious, is because when people feel like they haven't gotten enough sleep and they're not getting enough sleep, then they become anxious about getting enough sleep. And then you're anxious before going to sleep, like, I'm not going to fall asleep, it's going to be 45 minutes. And then that's a positive feedback loop. So you need to break that loop, say, okay, my body's going to get as much sleep as it needs, I needn't worry about it. Practice this relaxation to say, hey, it's all okay, it's going to be all right. And then concentrate on things that relax you, whether it's concentrating or not concentrating, whatever it is. You mentioned yoga Nidra, and that reminded me of transcendental meditation, which is something that also hasn't been studied. Well, our large, largely because we can't ask non human animals to do it. And so we don't know what's happening with our neurochemistry and our brain activity in a deep and meaningful way. But one thing that has been shown and those that can do it really well, is that, that theta activity that I said happens when you're learning something or when you're in REM sleep. It's well established and increases during the transcendental meditation. So it might be that some states of meditation could in some ways, replace or mimic some functions of, for example, REM sleep. But again, we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right to do. For example, the thing that I was talking about, which is erasing the novelty encoding structures of the brain that needs an absence of norepinephrine and, and serotonin, which we don't know if that goes away with transcendental meditation. We just don't know the answer to that yet."

It sounds mystical, it sounds like flying carpets, and it sounds like you have to go to Esalen, by the way. Esalen's a beautiful place, but it sounds like you have to go there or live in the west coast to believe in this stuff. But it's simply not the case. These are practices that are really just self directed relaxation as a practice that allows people to get better and better at directing their brain states towards more relaxation. And most people have an asymmetry. Like, for instance, most people can force themselves to stay up later, but they have a hard time going to sleep earlier.

Emphasized breathing does seem to increase the probability of transitioning back into sleep, and those are hallmarks of yoga, nidra, non sleep, deep rest, body scans. And so I think all of these things converge on a common theme. As neurobiologists, we can say, all of the things that we are describing certainly move the needle away from locus coeruleus activation. I mean, we haven't done the experiment to really look at that, but it seems all these things are counter to noradrenaline release."

A common, I think, friend of ours and direct colleague of yours, Jack Feldman, was a guest on this podcast telling us about all the amazing structures he and others have discovered in the respiration and breathing. Sounds like we have a collaboration brewing that the three of us should definitely carry out. I'd love for you to share with us a little bit more about the spindles that have come up a few times. And I don't know if it's relevant to this, so if it's not let's separate it out. But I'd love for you to tell us a little bit about the role of sleep in problem solving and creativity. And if spindles are involved, and I'll consider myself lucky for batching them in the same question, and if they're not involved, simply feel free to separate them out."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think they could be involved. And the reason why I think they could be involved because we now know a lot more about spindles. First of all, the first thing that we knew, first of all, we ignored them. Then we thought they had something to do with keeping us asleep. And that was their function, is when an external stimulus came, they would keep us asleep because they would would arise. But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles, the number that we produce per minute, is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place. And that no matter what your intelligence is, and no matter what your sleep spindle density is, if you learn something during the day and increase your sleep spindle density, it's really almost perfectly correlated with our ability to consolidate that information and incorporate it into the schema that we already have in our brain. So if you try and learn something new, even if your sleep spindle density at baseline is great, if you don't increase your sleep spindles that night, you're not going to use sleep to really incorporate it. Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor in those with schizophrenia. It's one of the characteristic signatures of sleep is that sleep spindles are very few and far between, which might mean that people with schizophrenia might not be able to incorporate new information into already existing schema. And instead, it sort of flaps in the breeze out there and can be accessed erroneously at times when you don't want it to be involved. So I digress. So, sleep spindles and creativity. So one of the things we now know through some great studies by Julie seat and Anita Luthier, is that sleep spindles are accompanied by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites, the listening branches of our neurons that listen to other cortical areas. So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons that listen to the external world and are conducted through the thalamus. And then there are distal dendrites, which listen to an internal kind of conversation that's happening in our brains. It's kind of our internal state, really. And during sleep spindles, that's when those distal dendrites are able to best learn from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus. It is during sleep spindles of the hippocampus and the cortex are best connected. And when that incredible plasticity can happen, when I talk about schema, that's a cortical, cortical thing, and the image of Santa Claus and presence comes together, it's not through some external thing. Once we learn those things together, it's our cortex that encodes that and brings those images back up together. That's during sleep spindles, when that's happening, when there's big surges of calcium into those distal dendrites, and where plasticity happens in just huge amounts during that sleep spindle stage of sleep, which is n two stage, there's also another excitatory event that comes all the way from the brainstem and projects everywhere in our cortex, which is called p geowaves, p for pons, g for geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which is where they first discovered an o for occipital area, which is a visual area, which is, again, where they were first discovered. But, in fact, it's now been shown that PGO waves, which we should generalize to p waves because they come from the pons and go to the thalamus, and then the cortex happens all over the brains. And that is where glutamate, which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter involved in learning and plasticity, is being released in big amounts, also in those distal dendrites. So p waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity and sew our schema together, which could be the origins for insight and creativity. Now, when PGO waves, or p waves, were first discovered, it was thought to be random, because this small area that generates P waves all over the brain projects all over the thalamus and causes p waves all over. And you don't measure p waves all over the brain at the same time. In fact, it just seems sporadic and random. And p waves are also happening even more during REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep. So that's why people think that REM dreams are so random, is because these p waves are random, and they could generate dreams, because they're an internal source of excitation that kind of replaces the outside world during our dream state. And so these p waves, if they are random, could function, could be the underlying reason why REM sleep dreams are random. And it might also be why creativity can happen. There is because we're randomly activating, co activating different things in our brain that we can then sew together. But it might not be as random as we think. So that's a caveat there."

Sadly, gliomas and other cancers of the brain can sometimes, can often surface in the ponds, but we still know very little about it. I read a paper this last year, and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press, that during rapid eye movement sleep, people can solve problems or respond to external stimuli. Like, for instance, they would give them math problems. They'd whisper in their ear while they were in REM sleep. You know, what's two plus two? And then people would say, even though they were paralyzed, apparently they could still move their mouth because they'd say four or something like that. Or they'd say, what's your name?

        "text": "There's no jest about it. It's really actually intriguing and interesting and might relate to this paper that I talked about where we said different areas of the brain can be in different states at the same time. So lucid dreaming is another thing we can't ask animals to do, or can't ask them if they've done it, but we can certainly ask humans to do it, and some people can do it really well. And it would be really interesting to see in those people who could lucid dream really well, whether they spend more or less time in this asymmetrical state where one area of the brain is in one state and another area of the brain is in another. And it might be that those people can respond to questions during rem sleep. Best are those that have the most asymmetry or dissimilarity or dissociation between subcortical and cortical structures. Or it might be that they're the ones with the most symmetry. We don't know. I do worry a little bit about lucid dreaming because people are a fad. People are really excited about it. And to be able to remember one's dreams is fun often, unless they're nightmares, but it's really interesting. Or to be able to direct one's dreams if they are nightmares is really wonderful power to have. To be able to redirect a nightmare that has been repeated to something else and then kick yourself out of that repetitive nightmare is really nice. But I worry a little bit about, because we know so little about what's actually going on in the brain. And if this lucid streaming state is preventing us from, for example, from the locus rilus from calming down, or the serotonergic system from silencing like it should, and maybe what we're doing during this state is, yeah, we're activating the learning and memory structures, but in a way that's maladaptive in terms of the erasure that we need to do. So maybe one of the reasons why most people don't remember or most of their dreams is for good reason. Your hippocampus is in a state where it's not writing new memories in fact, it's writing out the memories it learned during the day to the cortex, and it's immune from incoming new information. So maybe lucid dreaming is bad because you're activating the hippocampus in a way that's writing new memories, and it might be really maladaptive for things like, you know, PTSD. On the other hand, let me just argue myself right out of this. When I used to have a repeated nightmare when I was a kid, my mother, who's so wise, would tell me, well, listen, just next time you're in that dream, you know, say, hey, I'm in a dream, and then change something about it. So she and I rehearsed what, the horrible dream that it was. It was a big monster, you know, running after me, and my legs were like mud, and I couldn't run away, and it was just terrifying. And that was a dream I would have, you know, time and time again. She said, okay, next time, what are you going to do? And that monster comes after you. I'm going to run away. No, that's what you do every time, and it's always the same outcome. You can't run. So let's do something different. Like, what could you do that's different? So I came up with, well, I could turn around and punch it in the nose. Yeah, that's great. So the next time I had that dream, I did recognize this is that same old dream, which means that there's part of my brain that's conscious enough to know that this. That I'm in a dreaming state. And then I didn't have the courage in my dream because I was still terrified to punch, you know, or touch the monster in any way. But I did have the courage to turn around and look it in the eye and say, no. That was enough. I said, no. And that was enough to knock me out of that rut, of that dream so that I never had it again. I never had that same dream again. And in fact, it gave me peace about dreaming because I knew that if ever there was a nightmare that was just too scary, I could probably do something to change it and knock myself out of it. So even though I don't recommend lucid dreaming on a normal day to day basis, if it's enough, that can knock you out of a rut. One thing that happens with people with PTSD is they have the same repeated, horrible nightmare, which is often a reliving of the day's trauma that they had. So maybe lucid dreaming can be used on occasion to be a powerful tool, because there's so much plasticity that happens during REM sleep to knock you out of that rut, of reliving that event and just change it. And you could probably practice that during wakefulness, rehearse the event that happened that was so traumatic, and then just introduce a new element like, you know, now I'm safe, now, you know, the sound that was associated with that really traumatic thing I should now associate with something else. And next time I have that dream, I'm going to change it. So that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety. And that might be enough, maybe I hope, to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery. Because if you can calm down about those nightmare states of sleep, then maybe your locus aerilis, which is involved in stress, can also relax and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done."

This almost starts to sound like a little bit of a built in while sleeping trauma therapy, because most trauma therapies involve trying to get people into states of counter to what most people think. You actually want to get close to the trauma in terms of the narrative, but try and suppress the emotional activity of it. Or I guess that's the motivation for ketamine based therapies for trauma. Or I've also heard, and this is still perplexing to me, that other waking based trauma therapies involve taking people the other way, making it very cathartic. Take them to the peak of the emotional response, but then allow that to finally cycle down into a more relaxed response. So please, if there's anything about locus Coeruleus and dreams that can help people basically extinguish traumas or traumatic features to real life events, we definitely want to know about them."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think one of the things that people thought might help after a trauma, like a school shooting or whatever car accident, is to talk about it. But in fact, that ended up being counterproductive. And I think one of the reasons why it was counterproductive is because it didn't take them back down. It brought them up and continued to reactivate the emotions of it. But then, you know, emphasize the safety of fact that it's over or help them work through how they might avoid it again in the future to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again before they went to sleep. And in none of these studies has sleep ever been considered. But to me that's the key part, is bringing down your sympathetic nervous system before you go to sleep so that your sleep can be adaptive. Your locus rilus can shut off like it normally does or should do, and then able to erase the novelty of it. The other thing that I just mentioned a minute ago is that the emotional system is highly activated in REM sleep. And that's definitely true. And that might seem counter productive in terms of the nightmares and how to help REM sleep be a therapeutic thing rather than in reinforcing the emotionality of the trauma. And I think the key to that, again is the absence of norepinephrine. So even though the emotional system is in high gear, without norepinephrine, you can actually divorce those highly activated emotions from the cognitive parts of the memory that you have just written out in that n two state of sleep, when the sleep spindles are going. So you've just now consolidated the information that you'll need to survive and to make that adaptive. And now you need to divorce from that schema and from that semantic parts of memory, the emotional part, because whenever you remember something, it's fine if you remember being emotional at the time, but you don't want to bring back and sow into that memory all of the same emotional systems. You don't want to bring back, you know, the heart rate changes and the sweating and all of that. You want to be able to remember all the parts of it and even remember that you were traumatized and that you did cry and that you did have, you know, your heart was racing. But when you're talking about it years later, you don't want to have to relive all that. Otherwise, who, who would ever want to recall a traumatic memory? Because you're basically putting yourself through the same trauma, which is what people with PTSD have. They don't want to recall this traumatic memory because it's reliving it like it's just happening again. So that's what we're thinking, is that the emotional parts are no longer not able to be divorced because the norepinephrine system is not downscaled during REM sleep. And so that REM sleep serves to instead reinforce and in fact amplify the emotions because your emotional system is up, Locuserilla says, high resewing in every night the emotionality of those memories in with the memory itself."

We don't want to be thinking, oh, my ankle hurts. You want to just be able to ignore it and go do what you need to do. There are lots of other noradrenergic nuclei, but the locusterlus is the main one that projects all over the brain. Actually, the only place it doesn't project is the dorsal striatum. You talked about ventral striatum and addiction. The dorsal striatum is the only place the locust doesn't have project to, and that's involved in procedural learning, motor learning, the kinds of learning that take over when your hippocampus, for example, is compromised, bilateral. If you don't have a good hippocampus, you can still do procedural learning and do, and it's great. It's a redundant system. And so if your locus thrillist is not working, if you don't have it anymore, you can still do. If you, if you don't have a good hippocampus, you can still do learning through this story, dorsal striatum structure. So it might be for those kinds of learning functions, sleep deprivation, where you never let the locus thrill stop firing, is okay because it doesn't have any receptors for norepinephrine anyway, so.

        "text": "Yeah, well, this is a very young area. And in fact, my laboratory has just started. Graduate student who's been in my lab for just one year. She's done amazing work already, but completely groundbreaking work. And what she has discovered already, we don't have the paper out yet, but we're working on it, is that when animals withdraw from opiates, and this has been sort of replicated in other ways with other types of things, our sleep is disturbed. Our sleep is terribly disturbed. And the amount of sleep disturbance predicts relapse behaviors. And you might think, well, of course you're going to relapse if you can't sleep because opiates calm you down. Well, one of the reasons why opiates calm you down is because the locus coerulus, again blue spot is covered with opiate receptors that are normally really responsive to our endogenous opiates. And so what happens when we are pleased, for example, or laughing or whatever, opiates activate those receptors in the locus rilus and calm it down. It actually suppresses locus rilus activity, makes us happy and relaxed. One of the reasons why opiates are so addictive is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed. But the problem with exogenous opiates is that they really strongly bind these receptors on our locus coerulus. And if you take, take exogenous opiates again and again, like you're recovering from surgery, for example, and take these pain medications, is that our locust r struggles to do what it's supposed to do, which is keep us awake and learning and concentrating on things. So it will down regulate, it will internalize these receptors that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates. And it will do this, it will change our genes that are associated with producing these receptors. So you actually have very many fewer receptors. So the locus really, at least during wakefulness, can fire and help us to do these things like learn about our environment. And so if you long term reduce the number of receptors out there, then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates, there is not enough of your endogenous opiates to be able to occupy those few receptors that are there. And our locus realis has nothing to calm it down anymore. No pacifier. And it just fires and fires and fires. And that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out because it's normally associated with stress. And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that and also activates our locus rhylus, there's nothing to calm it down again. And so it just keeps firing. It disturbs our sleep. And that's why maybe sleep disturbance is an indicator of hyperactive locus perilis and such a good predictor of relapsed behaviors, because nobody likes to live in that high stress state and they will do anything to get back to normal. The problem with taking these drugs is that it leaves you excited and, sorry, excited, relaxed and happy. But then when you come off of it, you're worse than when you were at baseline. You take it again, it only brings you up this far because you have fewer receptors. When you come off it, you're down even more. Depressed and anxious and depressed, as a word I use loosely, and that's not what I certainly."

So, yeah, so we don't know yet what, and there's some good research going on right now, what could restore our own endogenous receptors so that our endogenous opiates can properly calm our locus pilis once that they have been tamped down by exogenous opiates. But that would be really one way that you can access the sleep disturbance. So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning and memory, the importance of the structure of the 90 minutes cycle for all of that. So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed by too much locus aerulous activity, the structure and the function of those sleep spindles and that theta during REM sleep and the lack of norepinephrine, all of those structures, all those functions for learning something new, like a new behavior that doesn't involve the drugs, becomes compromised. And so that's something that Tanya Lugos, in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA, that we're looking at. How is learning and memory affected by the sleep disturbance? Is there a way we can, in animals that have coming off of opiates, can we restore their sleep to normal so that then they are less likely to do relapse kinds of behaviors?"

Meanwhile, I think for anyone who's trying to come off opiates, exogenous opiates, and restore these systems, what I'm hearing is that it's going to take some time, but that any and all things that people can do to buffer their healthy, normal sleep architecture like morning and daytime sunlight, limiting bright light exposure, lowering the temperature at night, a number of things that we've talked about on this podcast."

And I just said, after three days, this is enough. I'm just going to try tylenol. And so I weaned myself. Not weaned, I just did a sudden sharp cut off. And even though I felt I didn't get the high of opiates when I was taking the Tylenol codeine, when I went off it, boy, it was like PM's times 100. I was so anxious and upset at little things. It thankfully only lasted a few hours. But if I had taken it for a week or two weeks, who knows if my endogenous opiate receptors would have been permanently down regulated and I would have been an addict, you know, an addict. I would have been addicted. I shouldn't say an addict. There's negative connotations. It's just a very physiological state, so no judgments at all associated with it. So, yeah, they're powerful, powerful painkillers, but can also alter your entire brain and rewire it. Yeah."

I must say, you've taught us a tremendous amount in a relatively short amount of time about the architecture of sleep, the different phases, the relationship between sleep and dreaming, and this incredible structure, locus coeruleus. And I'm so happy we also got into the ponds. That just delights me because we rarely talk about the ponds on this podcast. But it's such an interesting structure. Sex differences that are important, creativity and problem solving, and trauma sleep spindles. Just such a wealth of information, and much of it that's actionable for people. So, first of all, I want to say thank you for taking the time to sit down and have this conversation that so many people are sure to benefit from. I also want to thank you for doing the work you do. Even though I'm a fellow neurobiologist, I think that it's not often that we take a step back and realize that it's really the work. Hard thinking, hard, strongly motivated. PIs stands for principal investigator, by the way, PIs like yourself, graduate students and postdocs that really drive the discovery forward and that lead to these new therapeutics. Physicians are wonderful. Clinicians are absolutely wonderful. But clinicians don't develop new treatments. They only implement the ones that researchers discover. So thank you for being a brain explorer with a focus on growing the good in the world. I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much."

I used to be a graduate student and a postdoc trainee myself, doing all of this on the ground, hands on experimentation. It's so hard to do. It's so hard to do, right? It's so hard to think through all of that. Now I'm a PI. I get to be an idea person and just say, hey, why don't you do this? And, hey, you know, what do you think about that course? Intellectually contributes so much to these planned experiments, but they also do the really hard work. And so I just want to say thank you, graduate students.

I hope you found it to be as informative and as actionable as I did. In fact, I'm already implementing the regularity of bedtime, plus or minus half an hour in order to get that growth hormone release. And I can already see both my sleep scores improving and my feelings of daytime vigor and focus and other markers of sleep health improving as well.

On the Huberman Lab podcast, we often discuss supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep, for an enhancing focus, and for hormone support. The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with momentous supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, momentous supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, they mainly focus on single ingredient formulations, which is absolutely key if you want to develop a supplement regimen that's most biologically and cost effective. It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages across days to change the dosages of individual ingredients, so on and so forth. In addition, momentous supplements ship internationally, which we know is important because many of you reside outside of the United States. If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, please go to Livemomentous, spelled O U S. So that's Livemomentous.com Huberman, and you can get a 20% discount on any of those supplements. Again, it's Livemomentous.com huberman. The Huberman Lab podcast has a zero cost newsletter that includes summaries of podcast episodes and toolkits, so checklists of actionable tools that you can use for all aspects of mental health, physical health, and performance.

We do not share your email with anybody and you will get our monthly newsletter. And there are also some examples of previous newsletters also there@hubermanlab.com. dot if you're not already following me on social media, it is Huberman Lab. On all platforms, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And at all of those places, I cover science and science related tools, some of which overlap with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast. But much of which is distinct from the Huberman Lab podcast content. Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. Thank you again for joining me for today's discussion with Doctor Gina Poe, all about sleep and its relationship to mental health, physical health and performance. And last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in sleep science."
