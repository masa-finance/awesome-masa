I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor David Burson, professor of medical science, neurobiology and ophthalmology at Brown University. Doctor Burson's laboratory is credited with discovering the cells in the eye that set your circadian rhythms. These are the so called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells. And while that's a mouthful, all you need to know for sake of this introduction is that those are the cells that inform your brain and body about the time of day. Doctor Burson's laboratory has also made a number of other important discoveries about how we convert our perceptions of the outside world into motor action. More personally, Doctor Burson has been my go to resource for all things neuroscience for nearly two decades. I knew of his reputation as a spectacular researcher for a long period of time, and then many years ago, I cold called him out of the blue. I basically corralled him into a long conversation over the phone, after which he invited me out to Brown. And we've been discussing neuroscience and how the brain works and the emerging new technologies and the emerging new concepts in neuroscience for a very long time now. You're going to realize today why Doctor Burson is my go to source. He has an exceptionally clear and organized view of how the nervous system works. There are many, many parts of the nervous system, different nuclei and connections and circuits and chemicals and so forth, but it takes a special kind of person to be able to organize that information into a structured and logical framework that can allow us to make sense of how we function in terms of what we feel, what we experience, how we."

And I give him credit as one of my mentors and one of the people that I respect most in the field of science and medical science generally. Today, Doctor Burson takes us on a journey from the periphery of the nervous system, meaning from the outside, deep into the nervous system, layer by layer, structure by structure, circuit by circuit, making clear to us how each of these individual circuits work and how they work together as a whole. It's a really magnificent description that you simply cannot get from any textbook, from any popular book, and frankly, as far as I know, from any podcast that currently exists out there. So it's a real gift to have this opportunity to learn from Doctor Burson again. I consider him my mentor in the field of learning and teaching neuroscience, and I'm excited for you to learn from him. One thing is for certain, by the end of this podcast, you will know far more about how your nervous system works than the vast majority of people out there, including many expert biologists and neuroscientists scientists before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day, is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every."

There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin D three and k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element, and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium. But it has no sugar. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function, neuron function, as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body. If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized. If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low, we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise. Our mood is off, hormone systems go off. Our ability to get into physical action, to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is demanding. So with element, you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes."

Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep depreciation breast protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much."

And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations. And there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session.

In the end, the reason you have a visual experience is that your brain has got some pattern of activity that associates with the input from the periphery. But you can have a visual experience with no input from the periphery as well. When you're dreaming, you're seeing things that aren't coming through your eyes."

But the point is that the experience of seeing is actually a brain phenomenon. But of course, under normal circumstances, we see the world because we're looking at it and we're using our eyes to look at it. And fundamentally, when we're looking at the exterior world, it's what the retina is telling the brain that matters. So there are cells called ganglion cells. These are neurons that are the key cells for communicating between eye and brain. The eye is like the camera. It's detecting the initial image, doing some initial processing, and then that signal gets sent back to the brain proper. And of course it's there, at the level of the cortex, that we have this conscious visual experience. There are many other places in the brain that get visual input as well, doing other things with that kind of information."

We think about photons as particles, and that's one way of thinking about light, but we can also think of it as a wave, like a radio wave. Either way is acceptable. And the radio waves have frequencies like the frequencies on your radio dial. And certain frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum can be detected by neurons in the retina. Those are the things we see. But there's still different wavelengths within the light that can be seen by the eye. And those different wavelengths are unpacked, in a sense, or decoded by the nervous system to lead to our experience of color. Essentially, different wavelengths give us the sensation of different colors through the auspices of different neurons that are tuned to different wavelengths of light."

        "text": "So when a photon. So when a little bit of light hits, my eye goes in, the photoreceptors convert that into electrical signal, right? How is it that a given photon of light gives me the perception, eventually leads to the perception of red versus green versus blue, right?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "So if you imagine that in the first layer of the retina, where this transformation occurs from electromagnetic radiation into neural signals, that you have different kinds of sensitive cells that are expressing, they're making different molecules within themselves for this express purpose of absorbing photons, which is the first step in the process of seeing. Now, it turns out that altogether there are about five proteins like this that we need to think about in the typical retina. But for seeing color, really, it's three of them. So there are three different proteins. Each absorbs light with a different preferred frequency, and then the nervous system keeps track of those signals, compares and contrasts them to extract some understanding of the wavelength composition of light. So you can see just by looking at a landscape, oh, it must be late in the day, because things are looking golden. That's all a function of our absorbing the light that's coming from the world and interpreting that with our brain because of the different composition of the. The light that's reaching our eyes."

It's a question that really probably can't even ultimately be answered by the usual empirical scientific processes, because it's really about an individual's experience what we can say is that the biological mechanisms that we think are important for seeing color, for example, seem to be very highly similar from one individual to the next, whether it be human beings or other animals. And so we think that the physiological process looks very similar on the front end. But once you're at the level of perception or understanding or experience, that's something that's a little bit tougher to nail down with the sorts of scientific approaches that we approach biological vision with."

I often wondered, when I had my dog what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision. And certainly there are animals that can see things that we can't see. What are some of the more outrageous examples of that? Of seeing things in the extreme dogs, I'm guessing, see reds more as oranges, is that right? Cause they don't have the same array of neurons that we have for seeing color."

And if you look at the way that color vision is thought to work, you can sort of see that it has to be three different signals. There are a couple of other types of pigments. One is really mostly for dim light vision. When you're walking around in a moonless night and you're seeing things with very low light, that's the rod cell, and that uses its own pigment. And then there's another class of pigments we'll probably talk about a little bit later. This melanopsin pigment I thought you were."

In most mammals, including your dog or your cat, there really are only two cone types, and that limits the kind of vision that they can have in the domain of wavelength or color, as you would say. So really, a dog sees the world kind of like a particular kind of color. Blind human might see the world, because instead of having three channels to compare and contrast, they only have two channels.

So in those moments, that can be a real problem. If there's a lack of contrast to their visual system, they will be blind to that. In general, it's a fairly modest visual limitation as things go. For example, if not being able to see acutely can be much more damaging. Not being able to read fine print, for example."

Photopigment, of course, being the thing that absorbs light of a particular wavelength. And let's talk about these specialized ganglion cells that communicate certain types of information from eye to the brain that are so important for so many things. What I'm referring to here, of course, is your co discovery of the so called intrinsically photosensitive cells, the neurons in the eye that do so many of the things that don't actually have to do with perception, but have to do with important biological functions. What I would love for you to do is explain to me why, once I heard you say, we have a bit of fly eye in our eye, and you showed this slide of a giant fly from a horror movie trying to attack this woman, and maybe it was an eye also. So what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly eye in our eye?"

One can think about it as really the initial sensitive element in a system that's designed to tell your brain about how bright things are in your world. And the thing that's really peculiar about this pigment is that it's in the wrong place, in a sense. When you think about the structure of the retina, you think about a layer cake. Essentially, you've got this thin membrane at the back of your eye, but it's actually a stack of thin layers. And the outermost of those layers is where these photoreceptors you were talking about earlier are sitting. That's where the film of your camera is essentially that's where the photons do their magic with the photopigments and turn it into a neural signal."

And now you've got an array of sensors that's capturing that information and creating a bitmap, essentially. But now it's in neural signals distributed across the surface of the retina. So all of that was known to be going on 150 years ago. A couple of types of photoreceptors, cones and rods, if you look a little bit more closely, three types of cones. That's where the transformation from electromagnetic radiation to neural signals was thought to take place. But it turns out that this last photopigment is in the other end of the retina, the innermost part of the retina. That's where the so called ganglion cells are. Those are the cells that talk to the brain, the ones that actually can communicate directly what information comes to them from the photoreceptors. And here you've got a case where actually some of the output neurons that we didn't think had any business being directly sensitive to light were actually making this photopigment, absorbing light and converting that to neural signals and sending it to the brain. So that made it pretty surprising and unexpected. But there are many surprising things about these cells."

So the link there is that if you ask how the photopigment now communicates downstream from the initial absorption event to get to the electrical signal, that's a complex cellular process. It involves many chemical steps. And if you look at how photoreceptors in our eyes work, you can see what that cascade is, how that chain works. If you look in the eyes of flies or other insects or other invertebrates, there's a very similar kind of chain. But the specifics of how the signal gets from the absorption event by the pigment to the electrical response that the nervous system can understand are characteristically different between fuzzy, furry creatures like us and insects, for example, like the fly."

So why does your nervous system need to know whether it's daylight right now? Well, one thing that needs to know that is your circadian clock. If you travel across time zones to Europe, now, your internal clock thinks it's California time, but the rotation of the earth is for a different part of the planet. The rising and setting of the sun is not at all what your body is anticipating. So you've got an internal representation of the rotation of the earth in your own brain. That's your circadian system. It's keeping time. But now you've played a trick on your nervous system. You put yourself in a different place where the sun is rising at the wrong time. Well, that's not good for you. Right. So you got to get back on track. One of the things this system does is sends a, oh, it's daylight now signal to the brain, which compares with its internal clock. And if that's not right, it tweaks the clock gradually until you get over your jet lag and you feel back on track again."

They're all, you know, they got little clocks, little clocks in themselves. They're all clocks. You know, they need to be synchronized appropriately, and the whole thing has to be built in biological machinery. This is actually a beautiful story about how gene expression can control gene expression. And if you set it up right, you can set up a little thing that just sort of hums along at a particular frequency. In our case, it's humming along at 24 hours because that's how our earth rotates, and it's all built into our biology. So this is great. But the reality is that the clock can only be so good.

If you put someone in a cave, their biological clock will keep time to within a handful of minutes of 24 hours. That's no problem for one day. But if this went on without any correction, eventually you'd be out of phase. And this is actually one of the things that blind patients often complain about. If they've got retinal blindness is insomnia and sleep awake in the middle of the night. Exactly. They're not synchronized. Their clock is there, but they're drifting out of phase because their clock's only good to 24.2 hours or 23.8 hours. Little by little, they're drifting. So you need a synchronization signal. So even if you never cross time, of course we didn't. Back on the savannah, we stayed within walking distance of where we were. You still need a synchronizer, because otherwise you have nothing to actually confirm when the rising in the setting of the sun is. That's what you're trying to synchronize yourself to."

The role of the central pacemaker for the circadian system is to coordinate all of these. There's a little nucleus, a little collection of nerve cells in your brain that's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the SCN. And it is sitting in a funny place for the rest of the structures in the nervous system that get direct retinal input. It's sitting in the hypothalamus, which you can think about as sort of the great coordinator of drives and the source."

All these things are coordinated by the hypothalamus. So this pathway that we're talking about from the retina and from these peculiar cells that are encoding light intensity are sending signals directly into a center that's surrounded by all of these centers that control autonomic nervous system and your hormonal systems. So this is a part of your visual system that doesn't really reach the level of consciousness. It's not something you think about. It's happening under the radar kind of all the time, and the signal is working its way into this central clock coordinating center. Now, what happens then is not that well understood, but it's clear that this is a neural center that has the same ability to communicate with other parts of your brain as any other neural center. And clearly there are circuits that involve connections between neurons that are conventional. But in addition, it's quite clear that there are also humoral effects, that things are oozing out of the cells in the center and maybe into the circulation or just diffusing through the brain to some extent that can also affect neurons elsewhere. But the hypothalamus uses everything to control the rest of the body, and that's true. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, this circadian center as well, it can get its fingers into the autonomic nervous system, the humoral system, and, of course, up to the centers of the brain that organize coordinated, rational behavior."

The taste buds on your tongue. They're taking this raw information in and they're doing some preprocessing, maybe, or the early circuits are. But eventually most of these signals have to pass through the gateway to the cortex, which is the thalamus. And we've known for years, for decades, many decades, what the major throughput pathway from the retina to the cortex is and where it ends up. It ends up in the visual cortex. You pat the back of your head. That's where the receiving center is for the main pathway from retina to cortex. But wait a minute, there's more.

I find that really interesting, because most of what I think about, when I think about these fancy, well, or these primitive, rather, neurons that don't pay attention to the shapes of things, but instead to brightness, I think of, well, it regulates melatonin, circadian clock mood, hunger, the really kind of vegetative stuff, if you will. And this is interesting because I think a lot of people experience depression, not just people that live in Scandinavia in the middle of winter, and we are very much divorced from our normal interactions with light. It also makes me realize that these intrinsically photosensitive cells that set the clock, et cetera, are involved in a lot of things, seem to regulate a dozen or more different basic functions. I want to ask you about a different aspect of the visual system now, which is the one that relates to our sense of balance. So I love boats, but I hate being on them. I love the ocean from shore because I get incredibly seasick. It's awful. I think I'm going to get seasick if I think about it too much. And once I went on a boat trip, I came back and I actually, I got motion sick or wasn't seasick because I rafting. So there's a system that somehow gets messed up. They always tell us if you're feeling sick, to look at the horizon, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the link between our visual system and our balance system? And why does it make us nauseous sometimes when the world is moving in a way that we're not accustomed to? I realize this is a big question because it involves eye movement, etcetera, maybe just walk in at the simplest layers of vision, vestibular. So called balance system. And then maybe we can piece the system together for people so that they can understand.

Yeah, sort of. They got little cilia sticking up off the surfaces, and depending on which way you bend those, the cells will either be inhibited or excited. They're not even neurons. But then they talk to neurons with a neuron like process, and off you go. Now you've got an auditory signal if you're sensing things bouncing around in your cochlea, which is sound waves, sympathetically, the bouncing of your eardrum, which is sympathetically, the sound waves in the world. But in the case of the vestibular apparatus, evolution has built a system that detects the motion of, say, fluid going by those hairs. And if you put a sensor like that in a tube that's fluid filled, now you've got a sensor that will be activated when you rotate that tube around the axis that passes through the middle of it.

And if you. Green. Yeah, you can compare and trust, you get red, green, blue. So, same basic idea. If you have three sensors and you array them properly, now you can tell if you're rotating your head left or right, up or down.

When you suddenly rotate your head to the left, your eyes are actually rotating to the right automatically. You do this in complete darkness. If you had an infrared camera and watched yourself in complete darkness, you can't see anything rotating your head to the left, your eyes would rotate to the right. That's your vestibular system saying, I'm going to try to compensate for the head rotation. So my eyes are still looking in the same place. Why is that useful? Well, if I.

So let's get that aligned in each of your images. So you may not be aware if you're using a good new phone, that if you walk around a landscape and hold your phone, that there's all this image stabilization going on. But it's built into standard cinematic technology now because if you tried to do a handheld camera, things would be bouncing around. Things would be unwatchable. You wouldn't be able to really understand what's going on in the scene. So the brain works really hard to mostly stabilize the image of the world on your retina. Now, of course, you're moving through the world, so you can't stabilize everything. But the more you can stabilize most of the time, the better you can see. And that's why when we're scanning a scene, looking around at things, we're making very rapid eye movements for very short periods of time, and then we just rest. But we're not the only ones that do that. If you ever watch a hummingbird, it does exactly the same thing at a feeder, right, but it's, with its body jolting, it's going to make a quick movement, and then it's going to be stable. And when you watch a pigeon walking on the sidewalk, it does this funny head bobbing thing, but what it's really doing is racking its head back on its neck while its body goes forward so that the image of the visual world stays static."

So if you're driving, your body senses that you're moving forward. Your vestibular systems is picking up this acceleration of the car, and your visual system is seeing the consequences of forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past you.

So it's taking in information about everything that's happening everywhere, not only through your sensory systems, but is listening in to all the little centers elsewhere in your brain that are computing what you're going to be doing next and so forth.

But if you suddenly eliminated the air traffic control system, planes could still take off and land, but you might have some unhappy accidents in the process. So the cerebellum is kind of like that. It's not that you would be paralyzed if your cerebellum was gone, because you still have motor neurons, you still have ways to talk to your muscles, you still have reflex centers, and it's not like you would have any sensory loss, because you still have your cortex getting all of those beautiful signals that you can think about. But you wouldn't be coordinating things so well anymore. The timing between input and output might be off. Or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move, like an overhead serve in tennis, you'd be just terrible at learning all of the sequences of muscle movements and the feedback from your sensory apparatus that would let you really hit that ball exactly where you wanted to. After the nth rep. Right, the thousandth rep or something, you get much better at it. So the cerebellum's all involved in things like motor learning and refining the precisions of movement so that they get you where you want to go. If you reach for a glass of champagne that you don't knock it over or stop short. That's what he's good at."

There's a kind of tremor that can occur as they're reaching for things because they reach a little too far, and then they over correct and come back, things like that.

This image stabilizing network, it's all happening there, and there's learning happening there as well. So that if your vestibular apparatus is a little bit damaged, somehow your visual system is actually talking to your cerebellum saying, there's a problem here, there's an error, and your cerebellum is learning to do better by increasing the output of the vestibular system to compensate for whatever that loss was. So it's a little error correction system that's sort of typical of a cerebellar function, and it can happen in many, many different domains.

So it's just a question of are you trying to get more pressure or less pressure behind the eardrum? And there's a little tube that does that and comes down into your back of your throat there. And if you force pressure up that tube, you're going to be putting more air pressure into the compartment to counter it. If it's not enough and if you're sucking, you're going the other way. In reality, I think as long as you open the passageway, pressure differential is going to solve your problem. So I think you could actually blow in when you're not, quote, supposed to okay."

The last bit of that before you get to this relay up to the cortex is the midbrain, and there's a really important visual center there. It's called the superior colliculus. There's a similar center in the brains of other vertebrate animals. A frog, for example, or a lizard would have. This is called the optic tectum there. But it's a center then, in these non mammalian vertebrates, is really the main visual center. They don't really have what we would call a visual cortex, although there's something sort of like that. But this is where most of the action is in terms of interpreting visual input and organizing behavior. Around that, you can think about this region of the brainstem as a reflex center that can reorient the animals gaze or body, or maybe even attention to particular regions of space out there around the animal.

I don't want to eject us from the midbrain and go back to the vestibular system, but I do have a question that I forgot to ask about the vestibular system, which is, why is it that for many people, including me, despite my motion sickness in caps, that there's a sense of pleasure in moving through space and getting tilted relative to the gravitational pull of the earth? For me, growing up, it was skateboarding. But people like to corner in cars, corner on bikes. Maybe for some people, it's done running or dance. But what is it about moving through space and getting tilted? A lot of surfers around here getting tilted. That can tap into some of the pleasure centers. Do we have any idea why that would feel good?"

The midbrain is combining all these different signals for reflexive action. At what point does this become deliberate action? Because if I look at something I want and I want to pursue it, I'm going to go toward it. And many times that's a deliberate decision."

        "text": "Right. So this gets very slippery, I think, because what you have to try to imagine is all these different parts of the brain working on the problem of staying alive and surviving in the world. They're working on the problem simultaneously. And there's not one right answer to how to do that. But one way to think about it is that you have high levels of your nervous system that are very well designed to override an otherwise automatic movement if it's inappropriate. So if you imagine you've been invited to tea with the queen and she hands you a very fancy Wedgwood teacup. Very thin Wedgwood teacup. Yes. With very hot tea in it. And you're burning your hand. You probably will try to find a way to put that back down on the saucer rather than just dropping it on the floor, because you're with the queen. You're trying to be appropriate to that. So you have ways of reigning in the automatic behaviors if they're going to be maladaptive. But you also want the reflex to work quickly. If it's the only thing that's going to save you, the looming object coming at your head, you don't have time to think about that. This is the interplay in these hierarchically organized centers of the nervous system. At the lowest level, you've got the automatic centers and reflex arcs that will keep you safe even if you don't have time to think about it. And then you've got the higher center saying, well, maybe we could do this as well, or maybe we shouldn't do that at all. So you have all of these different levels operating simultaneously, and you need bi directional communication between high level cognitive centers, decision making on the one hand, and these low level, very helpful reflexive centers, but they're a little bit rigid, little hardwired, so they need some nuance. So both of these things are operating in tandem in real time, all the time in our brains, and sometimes we listen more to one than the other. You've heard people in sports talking about messing up at the play because they overthought it, thinking too hard about it. That's partly. You've already trained your cerebellum how to hit a fastball right down the middle."

A tremendous amount of online attention is devoted to trying to get people motivated. This isn't the main focus of our podcast. We touch on some of the underlying neural circuits of motivation, dopamine, and so forth. But so much of what people struggle with out there are elements around failure to pay attention or challenges in paying attention, which is essentially like putting the blinders on, getting a social, a straw view of the world, and maintaining that for a bout of work or something of that sort, and trying to get into action. So, of course, this is carried out by many neural circuits, not just the basal ganglia, but what are the basal ganglia, and what are their primary roles in controlling go type behavior and no go type behavior?"

And in a way, you can think about this logically as saying, if you have the ability to withhold behavior or to execute it, how do you decide which to do? Well, the cortex is going to have to do that thinking for you.

We don't have the whole picture yet, but it does look as if some parts of the brain are much more important for things, like reaching for things in the space around you.

What happens to somebody when they become blind because of problems in the eye, the retina, perhaps, you have a big chunk of the cortex, this really valuable real estate for neural processing that has come to expect input from the visual system, and there isn't any anymore. So you might think about that as fallow land. Right. It's unused by the nervous system, and that would be a pity. But it turns out that it is, in fact, used. And the case that you're talking about is of a woman who was blind from very early in her life and who had risen through the ranks to a very high level executive secretarial position in a major corporation. And she was extremely good at Braille reading, and she had a braille typewriter, and that's how everything was done. And apparently she had a stroke and was discovered at work, collapsed, and they brought her to the hospital. And apparently the neurologist who saw her when she finally came to said, I've got good news and bad news. Bad news is you've had a stroke. The good news is that it was in an area of your brain you're not even using. It's your visual cortex. And I know you're blind from birth, so there shouldn't be any issue here. The problem was she lost her ability to read braille. So what appears to have been the case, and this has been confirmed in other ways by imaging experiments in humans, is that in people who are blind from very early in birth, the visual cortex gets repurposed as a center for processing tactile information. And especially if you train to be a good braille reader, you're actually reallocating somehow that real estate to your fingertips, a part of the cortex that should be listening to the eyes. So that's an extreme level of plasticity, but what it shows is the visual cortex is kind of a general purpose processing machine. It's good at spatial information, and the skin of your fingers is just another spatial sense. And deprived of any other input, the brain seems smart enough, if you want to put it that way, to rewire itself to use that real estate for something useful, in this case, reading braille."

So really, really tiny on the scale of individual synapses between individual neurons, or even smaller, like the individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets of neurotransmitter that are going to be released to allow one neuron to communicate to the next. So, very, very fine. But the notion here is that you're doing this section after section at very fine scale. So in theory, what you have is a complete description of a chunk of nervous tissue that is so complete that if you took enough time to identify where the boundaries of all the cells are, you could come up with a complete description of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue, because you have a complete description of where all the cells are and where all the synapses between where all the cells are. So now you essentially have a wiring diagram of this complicated piece of tissue. So the omics part is the exhaustiveness of it. Rather than looking at a couple of synapses that are interesting to you from two different cell types, you're looking at all the synapses of all of the cell types, which of course, is this massive avalanche of data, right?"

It's a use of electron microscopy, a very high resolution microscopic imaging system on a new scale with way more payoff in terms of understanding the connectivity of the nervous system. And it's just emerging. But I really think it's going to revolutionize the field because we're going to be able to query these circuits. How did they actually do it? Look at the hardware in a way that's never been possible before."

So what's it good for? I mean, maps are great. I always think of connectomics and genomics and proteomics, et cetera, as necessary, but not sufficient, right?"

        "text": "So, I mean, in many cases, what you do is you go out and probe the function, and you understand how the brain does the function by finding neurons that seem to be firing in association with this function that you're observing. And little by little, you work your way in, and now you want to know what the connectivity is. Maybe the anatomy could help you, but this connectomics approach, or at least the serial electron microscopy reconstruction of neurons approach, really is allowing us to frame questions, starting from the anatomy and saying, I see a synaptic circuit here. My prediction would be that these cell types would interact in a particular way. Is that right? And then you can go and probe the physiology, and you might be right or you might be wrong, but more often than not, it looks like the structure is pointing us in the right direction. So in my case, I'm using this to try to understand a circuitous that is involved in this image stabilization network. We're talking about keeping things stable on the retina, and this thing will only respond at certain speeds of motion. These cells in the circuit, like slow motion, they won't respond to fast motion. How does that come about? Well, I was able to probe the circuitry. I knew what my cells looked like. I could see which other cells were talking to it. I could categorize all the cells that might be the players here that are involved in this mechanism tuning the thing for slow speeds. And then we said, it looks like it's that cell type. And we went and looked and the data bore that up. But the anatomy drove the search for the particular cell type because we could see it connected in the right place to the right cells. So that creates the hypothesis that lets you go query the physiology, but it can go the other way as well. So it's always the synergy between these functional and structural approaches. It gives you the, the most lift. But in many cases, the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this, the structure, trying to work out the diagram because we haven't had the methods. Now the methods exist, and this whole field is expanding very quickly because people want these circuit diagrams for the particular part of the nervous system that they're working on. If you don't know the cell types and the connections, how do you really understand how the machine works?"

    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, what I love about it is we don't know what we don't know. And scientists, we don't ask questions. We pose hypotheses, hypotheses being, of course, some prediction that you wager your time on, basically, and it either turns out to be true or not true. But if you don't know that a particular cell type is there, you could never, in any configuration of life or a career or exploration of a nervous system, wager a hypothesis because you didn't know it was there. So this allows you to say, ah, there's a little interesting little connection between this cell that I know is interesting and another cell that's a little mysterious, but interesting. I'm going to hypothesize that it's doing blank, blank, and blank and go test that. And in the absence of these connectomes, you would never know that that cell was lurking there in the shadows, right?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "C",
        "text": "Right. Yeah. And if you're just trying to understand how information flows through this biological machine, you want to know where things are. Neurotransmitters are dumped out of the terminals of one cell, and they diffuse across the space between the two cells, which is kind of a liquidy space, and they hit some receptors on the postsynaptic cell and they have some impact. Sometimes that's not through a regular synapse. Sometimes it's through a neuromodulator, like you often talk about on your podcast that are sort of oozing dopamine. Exactly. Oozing into the space between the cells. And it may be acting at some distance, far from where it was released. Right. But if you don't know where the release is happening and where other things are that might respond to that release, you're groping around in the dark."

And this is somewhat unusual for somebody who's a, you know, endowed full professor, chairman of the department, et cetera, for many years, to be doing the hands on work. Typically, that's the stuff that's done by technicians or graduate students or postdocs. But I think it's fair to say that you really love looking at nervous systems and drawing the accurate renditions of how those nervous systems are organized and thinking about how they work."

But to know that the form is, in a sense, the function that the architecture of the connectivity is, how the computation happens in the brain at some level, even though we don't fully understand that in most contexts, gives me great joy, because I'm working on something that's both visually beautiful but also deeply beautiful in a higher knowledge context.

Well, as a final question, I get asked very often about how people should learn about neuroscience or how they should go about pursuing maybe an education in neuroscience if they're at the. At that stage of their life or that's appropriate for their current trajectory. Do you have any advice to young people, old people, anything in between about how to learn about the nervous system, maybe in a more formal way? I mean, obviously, we have our podcast. There are other sources of neuroscience information out there. But for the young person who thinks they want to understand the brain, they want to learn about the brain, what should we tell them?"

Many, many person hours have to go into that to come up with the map that you want of where the cells are. And he was very clever about setting up a context in which he could crowdsource this. And people who were interested in getting a little experience looking at nervous tissue and participating in a research project could learn how to do this and do a little bit from their living room.

So more of this is coming, and I'm actually interested in building more of this so that people who are interested want to participate at some level, don't necessarily have the time or resources to get involved in laboratory research, can get exposed to it and participate and actually contribute. So I think that's one thing. I mean, just asking questions of the people around you who know a little bit more and have them point you in the right direction. Here's a book you might like to read. There's lots of. Of great popular books out there that are accessible, that will give you some more sense of the full range of what's out there in the neurosciences and."
