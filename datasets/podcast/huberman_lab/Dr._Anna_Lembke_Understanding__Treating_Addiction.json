        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Doctor Anna Lemke. Doctor Lemke is a psychiatrist and the chief of the Addiction medicine dual diagnosis clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. She's a psychiatrist who treats patients struggling with addiction. She has successfully treated patients dealing with drug addiction, alcohol addiction, and behavioral addictions such as gambling and sex addiction, as well as other types of addiction. In fact, during our discussion, I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors and substances to which people can become addicted to, and that there is a common biological underpinning of all those addictions. I also learned that there is a common path to the treatment and recovery from essentially all addictions. Doctor Lembke explained that to me and explained how to think about and conceptualize our own addictions, as well as the addictions of other people who are struggling to get treatment, move through treatment, and stay sober from their addictions in addition to treating patients. Doctor Lembke is an author and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary the Social Dilemma. I'm excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out called Dopamine finding balance in the age of Indulgence. The book comes out August 24 and is an absolutely fascinating read into addiction and ways to treat various types of addiction. I've read the book cover to cover, and all I'll tell you is that at the very first chapter and throughout, you are going to be absolutely blown away. The stories about her patients are extremely engaging. It brings forward the real struggle of addiction and the incredible, I think it's fair to say, heroic battles that people fight in order to get through addictions of various kinds. And all of that is woven through with story, with science, in ways that make it very accessible to anyone. Whether or not you have a science background or not, I can't recommend it highly enough. So again, the book is dopamine finding balance in the age of indulgence. It comes out August 24 of this year, 2021, and you can pre order that book by going to Amazon. We will provide a link to that in the show. Caption before we begin, I just want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greenshouse. Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With athletic greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D three, k two there are a ton of data now showing that vitamin d three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D three k two. Today's episode is also brought to us by element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium, magnesium and potassium. But it has no sugar. I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function, neuron function, as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body. If we have sodium, magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios, all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized. If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low, we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise. Our mood is off, hormone systems go off. Our ability to get into physical action, to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished. So with element, you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement. That's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase. They're all delicious. So again, if you want to try element, you can go to elementlmnt.com Huberman todays episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, Nidra sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the waking up app a few years ago because even though ive been doing regular meditations since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations. And there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it called non sleep deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with doctor Anna Lembke. All right, great to have you here."

        "text": "Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you. I I and many listeners of this podcast are obsessed with dopamine. And what is dopamine? How does it work? We all hear that dopamine is this molecule associated with pleasure. I think the, uh, the term dopamine hits like, I'm getting a dopamine hit from this, from Instagram or from likes, or from praise or from whatever is now, um, commonly heard. What is dopamine? And what are maybe some things about dopamine that most people don't know? And probably that I don't know either."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So dopamine is a neurotransmitter, and neurotransmitters are those molecules that bridge the gap between two neurons. So they essentially allow one neuron, the presynaptic neuron, to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron. Dopamine is intimately associated with the experience of reward, but also with movement, which I think is really interesting because movement and reward are linked, right. If you think about, you know, early humans, you had to move in order to go seek out the water or the meat or whatever it was. And even in the most primitive organisms, dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment. For example, C. Elegans, a very primitive wormhood. So dopamine is this really powerful, important molecule in the brain that helps us experience pleasure. It's not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure, but it's a really, really important one. And if you want to think about something that most people don't know about, dopamine, which I think is really interesting, is that we are always releasing dopamine at a kind of tonic baseline rate, and it's really the deviation from that baseline, rather than, like, hits of dopamine in a vacuum, that make a difference. So when we experience pleasure, our dopamine release goes above baseline, and likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline, and then we experience a kind of pain."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Interesting. So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of dopamine, how frequently we are releasing dopamine in the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food or experience just sitting being. Is that associated with how happy somebody is, their kind of baseline of happiness or level of depression?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine. So that's a really reasonable thought, and there's some evidence to suggest that that may be true. The other thing that we know, and this is, you know, really kind of what. What the book is about, is that if we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway, that we can change our tonic baseline and actually lower it over time as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine, which is more really, than we were designed to, to experience."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Interesting. And is it the case that our baseline levels of dopamine are set by our genetics, by our heredity?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I think if you think about sort of the early stages of development in infancy, certainly that is true. You're kind of born with probably whatever is your baseline level. But obviously your experiences can have a huge impact on where youre a, your dopamine level ultimately settles out."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So if somebody's disposition is one of constant excitement and anticipation or easily excited, I think about the kind of people where you say, do you want to check out this new place for tacos? They're like, yeah, that'd be great. And other people are a little more cynical, harder to budge, like my bulldog Costello, very, very stable, low levels of dopamine with big inflections, in his case. Do you think that's set in terms of our parents? And obviously nature and nurture interact, but is dopamine at the core of our temperament?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I don't really think we know the answer to that, but I will say that people are definitely born with different temperaments. And those temperaments do affect their ability to experience joy. And we've known that for a long time. And we describe that in many different ways. One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era is to use psychiatric nomenclature, like this person has a dysthymic temperament or this person has chronic major depressive disorder. In terms of looking specifically at who's vulnerable to addiction, that's an interesting sort of mixed bag, because when you look at the research on risk factors for addiction, so what kind of temperament of a person makes them more vulnerable to addiction? You see some interesting findings first, you see that people who are more impulsive are more vulnerable to addiction. So what is impulsivity? That means having difficulty putting space between the thought or desire to do something and actually doing it. And people who have difficulty putting a space there who are, who have a thought to do something and just do it impulsively, are people who are more vulnerable to addiction."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Interesting in terms of impulsivity, is this something that relates literally to the startle reflex? Like I, for instance, as a lab director, I'm familiar with walking around my lab and when I decide, deciding I'm going to talk to my people, of course, when they knock on my door, it's always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now? Even though I love to talk to them. But I walk around my lab from time to time, and some people I notice, I'll say, do you have a moment? And they'll slowly turn around and say, yeah or no, in some cases. And other people will jump the moment I say their name. They actually have a kind of a heightened startle reflex. Is that related to impulsivity, or is what you're referring to an attempt to withhold behavior? That's very deliberate, under very deliberate conditions."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So I don't think that that startle reflex is necessarily related to impulsivity. That can be related to anxiety. So people who are high anxiety, people will tend to have more of a startle reflex. Impulsivity is a little bit different. And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad. Right. Impulsivity is that thing where there's not a lot of self editing or worrying about future consequences. You have the idea to do something, and you do it. And, of course, we can imagine many scenarios where that's absolutely wonderful. You know, there can be a sort of, let's say, intimate interactions between people where you wouldn't really want to be super inhibited about it. Right. You would want to be disinhibited and impulsive. I can also imagine, like, sort of fight or flight scenarios, like battle scenarios. Right. Where it would really be good to be impulsive and just go, rah, you."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yes, that's right. That's right. But, you know, and I think this brings up a really something that I've come to believe after 25 years of practicing psychiatry, is that what we now conceptualize in our current ecosystem as mental illness are actually traits that in another ecosystem might be very advantageous. They're just not advantageous right now because of the world that we live in. And I think impulsivity is potentially one of those, because we live in this world that's like, you have to constantly be thinking rationally about the consequences of x, y, or z. And it's such a sensory rich environment that we're being bombarded with all these opportunities, these sensory opportunities, and we have to constantly check ourselves. So impulsivity is something that right now can be a difficult trait, but isn't in and of itself a bad thing."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "I see. Yeah. And I'm beginning to realize it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity. What is pleasure, and how does it work at the biological level? And if it feels right at the psychological level, and if you don't mind painting a picture of sort of the range of things that you have observed in your clinic or in life that people can become addicted to. But just to start off really simply, what is this thing that we call pleasure?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Well, I think it's actually really hard to define pleasure in any kind of succinct way, because certainly there is the seeking out of high or a euphoria, or, I think, the kind of experience that most anybody would associate with the word pleasure. Also, the seeking out of those same substances and behaviors is often a way to escape pain. So, for example, when I talk to people with addiction, sometimes their initial foray into using a drug is to get pleasure. But very often it's a way to escape their suffering, whatever their suffering may be. And certainly as people become addicted, even those who initially were seeking out pleasure are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal or the pain of the consequences of their drug use. So I think it's, you know, very hard to actually, you know, define it as this unitary thing. And it's certainly not just getting a high. There are so many ways in which people sort of want to escape, which is not the same thing as sort of this hedonic wanting to feel pleasure."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "So someone could decide that they want to go out and dance or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing. I can imagine that. And maybe it's very difficult for them to stay seated when a particular song comes on, for instance. But seeking what we would call pleasure in order to eliminate pain, that evokes a different picture in my mind, that evokes a picture of somebody that feels lost or depressed or underwhelmed. I definitely want to get into the precise and general description of addiction and what that is. But in a previous conversation we had, you said something that really rung in my mind, which is that many people who become addicted to things, let's call them addicts, have this feeling that normal life isn't interesting enough, that they are seeking a super normal experience, and that the day to day routine balance, which is actually in the title of your book, Dopamine Nation, finding balance in the age of indulgence, that the word balance itself can sometimes be a bit of an aversive term for people. And I'm struck by this idea, and the reason I want to explore it is because so much of what I see online is about generating a lack of balance, about being tilted forward at all times, really leaning into life hard, experiencing life, living a full life. Even the commencement speech given by Steve Jobs on this campus was really about finding passion digging. That's so much in the narrative. Now, maybe you could just tell us a little bit about your experience with this association, if it really exists between people's sense of the normalcy, or maybe even how boring life can be and their tendency to become addicts of some sort."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, well, I mean, I think that life for humans has always been hard, but I think that now it's a harder in unprecedented ways. And I think that the way that life is really hard now is that it actually is really boring. And the reason that it's boring is because all of our survival needs are met. We don't even have to leave our homes to meet every single physical need, as long as you're of a certain level of financial well being, which, frankly, we talk so much about the income gap. And certainly there is this enormous gap between rich and poor, but that gap is smaller than it's ever been in. Like the history of humans. Even the poorest of the poor have more excess income to spend on leisure goods than they ever have before in human history. If you look at leisure time, for example. So people without a high school education have 42% more leisure time than people with a college degree. My point here is that life is hard now in this really weird way, in that we don't really have anything that we have to do. So we're all forced to make stuff up, whether it's being a scientist or being a doctor, or being an Olympic athlete or climbing Mount Everest. And people really vary in their need for friction. And some people need a lot more than others. And if they don't have it, they're really, really unhappy. And I do think that a lot of the people that I see with addiction and other forms of mental illness are people who need more friction. Like they're unhappy, not necessarily because there's something wrong with their brain, but because their brain is not suited to this world."

    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "And do you think they have that sense? My brain isn't suited to this world? Or they simply feel a restlessness and they're constantly seeking stimulation?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "I think that's right, yeah, I think it's not really knowing what's wrong with me? Why am I unhappy? How can I be happier? And of course, as you talk about, what's so pervasive in our narrative now is like, find your passion, find your, you know, whatever it is to save the world. And in a way, that's good because it has people out in the world and seeking. But in a way, it can also be misleading in the sense that I think people aren't entirely aware that the world is a hard place and that life is hard and that we're all kind of making it up. Do you know what I mean?"

So let's talk about the pleasure, pain, balance and addiction. And I've heard you use this seesaw, or balance scale, um, analogy before, and I think it's a wonderful one, uh, that really, for me, clarified what addiction is, at least at the mechanistic level."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. So to me, one of the most significant findings in neuroscience in the last 75 years is that pleasure and pain are co located, which means the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain. And they work like a balance. So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way. When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction. And one of the overriding rules governing this balance is that it wants to stay level. So it doesn't want to remain tipped very long to pleasure or to pain. And with any deviation from neutrality, the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance, or what scientists call homeostasis. And the way the brain does that is, with any stimulus to one side, there will be a tip, an equal and opposite amount to the other side."

When I watch YouTube videos of American Idol, you know, it tips to the side of pleasure, and then when I stop watching it, I have a comedown. Right. Which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount on the other side. And that's that moment of wanting to watch one more YouTube video. Right."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. And I just want to project there. So this moment of wanting to watch another that is associated with pain, I think is, are we always aware of that happening? Because you just described in a very conscious way."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "But when I indulge in something I enjoy, I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing. I don't think about the pain, I just think about more."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Right. So really excellent point. Because we're mostly not aware of it, and it's also reflected. So it's not something that consciously happens or that we're aware of unless we really begin to pay attention. And when we begin to pay attention, we really can become very aware of it in the moment. Again, it's like a falling away, like that you're on social media and you get a good tweet of something, and then you can't stop yourself because there's this awareness, a latent awareness, that as soon as I disengage from this behavior, I'm going to experience a kind of a pain. Right. A falling away, missing that feeling, a wanting more of it. And of course, one way to combat that is to do it more. Right. And more and more and more. So I think that is really what I want people to tune into and get an awareness around. Because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot. And then when you begin to see it, you have. And if you keep the model of the balance in mind, I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level and understand it. And in that understanding, get some mastery over it, which is really what this is all about. Because ultimately we do need to disengage. Right. We can't live in that space all the time. Right. We have other things we need to do, and there are also serious consequences that come with trying to repeat and continue that experience or that feeling."

        "text": "But what happens right after I do something that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine is, again, my brain is going to immediately compensate by down regulating my own dopamine receptors, my own dopamine transmission, to compensate for that. And that's that come down or the hangover, that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more. Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass, then my dopamine will reregulate itself and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is. But if I don't wait, and here's really the key, if I keep indulging again and again and again, ultimately I have. I have so much on the pain side, right, that I've essentially reset my brain to what we call like an anhedonic or lacking in joy type of state, which is a dopamine deficit state. So that's really the way in which pain can become the main driver, is because I've indulged so much in these high reward behaviors or substances that my brain has had to compensate by way down regulating my own dopamine such that even when I'm not doing that drug, I'm in a dopamine deficit state, which is akin to a clinical depression. I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria, and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again or getting the drug. And so that's the piece there. There's the single use which easily passes, but it's the chronic use that can then reset, really, our dopamine thresholds, and then nothing is enjoyable. Right. Then everything sort of pales in comparison to this one drug that I want to keep doing."

I know people in my life that are still talking about this one relationship, this one person that was just so great, despite all the challenges of that thing, that it's almost like they're addicted to the narrative. Yeah, they were, maybe still are addicted to the person. So it could be to any number of things. Video game, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative to me. And because of the way you describe this mechanism, this pleasure, pain balance, that all speaks to the kind of generalizability of our brain circuitry. And this is something that fascinates me, and I know it fascinates you as well, which is that nature did not evolve 20 different mechanisms for 20 different types of addiction. Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones and neurotransmitters and pathways, and one person is triggered by social interactions, another person is triggered by spiders, but the underlying response is identical, it sounds like, with addiction as well. There may be some nuance, but that they're sort of a core set of processes. So it doesn't really matter if it's gambling or video games or sex or a narrative about a previous lover or partner or whatever. It's the same addictive process underneath that. Is that correct?"

I once said, and I'm sure that I'm not the first person to say it, but I was thinking about addiction, and I was thinking about the underlying circuits, and I posted something to social media which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. That was the way that I crystallized the literature in my mind. And then we met, and you, of course, came and gave these amazing lectures in the neuroanatomy course for the medical students, and the rest is history. But I tossed out a kind of mirroring statement for that as well, which was a bit overstepping, I admit, which I said, addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. And dare I say, enlightenment is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure. Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is, but it was my attempt to take a little bit of a jab at the fact that nobody knows why not. Why wouldn't I throw a neurobiological explanation just to just kind of sample the waters? And people had varying levels of response. But the reason I bring that up is that I would imagine that being able to derive pleasure from many things would be a wonderful attribute. We know people like this that can experience pleasure in little things and in big events, not just the big milestones of life, but also the subtle, as the yogis would say, the subtle ripples of life, if such an ability exists, do you think that that reflects a healthily tuned dopamine system, one that can engage and enjoy but then disengage?

And the wisdom, I guess, to distill it down. I mean, it's many things, but in terms of dopamine, the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine, and there are less than adaptive ways.

But boredom is really, I think, anh important and necessary experience.

And that is really, really scary. That can feel like free fall, and yet that's really an important and good experience to have. And I think that is an experience out of which we can have a lot of creative initiative, but also really consider our priorities and values. Okay, here I am on planet Earth. What the hee haw am I going to do with my life? What do I really care about? How do I really want to spend my time when I'm not distracting myself, you know, in order to spend it? And then this gets back to our conversation a little bit earlier about finding your passion. So I think that one of the big problems now that's very misguided about this idea of finding your passion.

Stop looking for your passion. And instead, look around right where you are. Stop distracting yourself, look around right where you are and see what needs to be done. So not what do I want to do, but what is the work that needs to be done. And more importantly, it doesn't have to be some grandiose work like, does the garbage need to be taken out? Right? Is there some garbage on your neighbor's lawn that someone threw there that you could actually bend over and pick up and put into the garbage can? Look around you. There is so much work that needs to be done that nobody wants to do that is really, really important. And if we all did that, I really think the world would be a much better place. And this is what people who have severe addiction, who get into recovery realize. They're like, it's not about me and my will and what I'm going to will in my life or in the world. It's about looking around what needs to be done, what is the work that I am called to do in this moment, which also is incredibly freeing because I don't have to search for the perfect thing. There's a lot of burden now on young people that they have to find that perfect thing, and until they found that perfect thing, they're going to be miserable. You don't have to do that. Look at the life you were given. Look at the people around you. Look at the jobs that present themselves to you and do that job simply and honorably, one day at a time, with a kind of humility. I think this is really what, what's so striking to me about the wisdom of people in recovery. There's this incredible humility that comes out of that experience. You feel so broken, so ashamed, but you pick yourself up one day at a time and you build a life that's around. What can I do right in this moment that might benefit another person and thereby benefit me?"

And if you're willing, I'd like to actually stay on this issue of passion because I think the dopamine systems, if I understand them correctly, the dopamine systems merge with this work that you're referring to, this immediacy of things calling to us, like taking out the trash, which sounds, frankly, really boring, to be honest. I hate taking out the trash, but I do it because I like a clean home, and I like a home that smells good, or at least doesn't smell bad. So we do these things. And not that we want to offer some larger carrot as a consequence of doing those things, but if I understand correctly, what you're saying is in the act of looking at one's immediate environment, acting on that immediate environment, we cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain about action and reward. That, at least to my mind, span the range of small things being rewarding and then lead us to bigger things being rewarding. It's not like all we're going to do is take out trash and tend to house. We eventually will venture out and we, and eventually we'll find careers and work on those. But if I understand correctly, you're talking about getting into a sort of functional or adaptive action step. And it's the action step that these days we tend to overlook because most of our mindset is in things that are truly outside of the, our immediate reality. Do I have that correct?"

And they come to me and they say, I am anxious and depressed. I'm majoring in computer science. I hate it. I thought I would like it, you know, if I could only find that thing that I was really meant to do, my life would be better. And my first intervention for the many, many people like that, that I see in clinical care is you have it backwards. I don't say it quite like that. You are waiting for that thing to pull you out of the video game world and you're never going to find it as long as you're playing video games. Because video games are so powerfully dopaminergic that you have this distorted sense of really pleasure and pain and you, you will not be able to find that thing that you enjoy. And so of course the intervention is abstain from video games, reset your reward pathways, start with a level balance and what invariably happens, and I've just seen it over 20 years, so many times I've become really a believer in this. All of a sudden it's like, oh, wow, my computer science class is interesting this quarter. It's like, okay, you know, you have a receptivity then to experiencing pleasure and reward in a way you just don't have when you're bombarding your reward pathways with these high dopamine drugs."

And just to underscore this notion that tending to the immediate things can lead to super performance, I may have mentioned it earlier this episode, but if I didn't, I'll mention now, which is I have the great privilege of having some close friends that were in the SEAL teams and doing some work with those communities. And it's a remarkable community for reasons I think most people don't understand. People think they see the images carrying logs down the beach and all the blowing stuff, all the, all the stuff that's fun for guys like that. But all of the guys I know who are in the seal teams have this sense of duty about immediately things, and not just holding the door and doing the. Helping with the dishes and moving things around. They are constantly scanning their environment for what can be done. They essentially conquer every environment they're in. They are also, some of them, the most competitive human beings in the world. And they do it unless they're in the act of war, fighting, which is their real job. They do it in every environment in a very benevolent way. And it's a remarkable thing because I think it's what is part of what they're selected for. And, you know, there's a range there. But I think when we hear about tending to the immediate things, or this phrase, you know, how you do one thing is how you do anything. That's a tricky one for me, because there are certain things I just don't do well. But should we always be trying? I think that the tending to setting the horizon in closely and tending to things in one's immediate environment, I think is very powerful and translates, because again, I think the nervous system, it performs algorithms, it has action steps. The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing. It evolves to be able to use the same approach to doing lots of different things."

But I think also, as you say, our brain is really wired for the 24 hours period. We're not very good at sort of the, you know, ten year 20. I mean, we have these huge frontal lobes. And yes, we're great planners, and we can. But if we live too much in that space, we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost and either catastrophize or get grandiose. But if you can chunk it down to a day, what people in recovery talk about is how, if I can just do today, right, then I will get a chain of days that seem insignificant in their individual units. But after six months or a year or two years of those good days, I've got two very good years, right? And I look back and it's like, oh, wow, I guess I did all that, but I think that's really one of the keys, is really taking it one day at a time, which your seals, and also this connecting with the environment, right? So being awake and alert to your environment and connecting with your environment, not trying to escape it. And of course, escapism is what we all want and desire, that experience of non being. And we get it from the Internet or from drugs or whatever it is, but it is, it's the booby prize, because ultimately it takes you further and further away from your immediate environment, which is where we really have to connect to, to get that sense of groundedness and authenticity and like, of being in our own lives."

This actually came up in the discussion with Carl Dyseroth, who is also a successful scientist and clinician and manages a family, et cetera. So the unit of the day, I think, is fundamental. And those stack up, as you mentioned. So, along those lines, I've heard you say that in order to reset the dopamine system, essentially, in order to break an addictive pattern, to become unaddicted, 30 days of zero interaction with that substance, that person, etcetera. Is that correct?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah. And 30 days is, in my clinical experience, the average amount of time it takes for the brain to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself. There's also a little bit of science that suggests that that's true. Some imaging studies showing that our brains are still in a dopamine deficit state two weeks after we've been using our drug. And then a study by Shuckett and Brown, which took a group of depressed men who also were addicted to alcohol, put them in a hospital where they had received no treatment for depression, but they had had no access to alcohol in that time. And after four weeks, 80% of them no longer met criteria for major depression. Again, this idea that by depriving ourselves of this high dopamine, high reward substance or behavior, we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine for the balance to really quilt. Right? And then we're in a place where we can sort of enjoy other things."

So days one through ten, I would imagine, will be very uncomfortable. Yes, they're going to suck, basically, to be quite honest. Because the way you describe this pleasure pain balance, to my mind, says that if you remove what little pleasure one is getting, or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior, that's gone. The pain system is really ramped up and nothing is making me feel good. I'll just use myself as an example. I'm not in recovery, but that ten days is going to be miserable.

Like, you have to sign up for it. And I will say, obviously there are people with addictions that are so severe that as long as they have access to their drug or behavior, they're not able to stop themselves. And that's why we have higher levels of care or residential treatment. This is not going to be for everybody, this intervention. But it's amazing how many people with really severe addictions to things like heroin, cocaine, very severe pornography addictions. I posit this and I do it as an experiment. I said, let's try this experiment. I'm always amazed. Number one, how many of them are willing, and number two, how many of them are actually able to do it? They are able to do it. And so that little nudge is sort of just what they need. And the carrot is, you know, there's a better life out there for you and you'll be able to taste it in a month.

I've spent a lot of time in those places, actually, looking at it, researching. I've got friends in that community. I'm close with that community. One thing I've seen over and over again, sadly, often in the same individuals, is they get sober from whatever they're doing great. These are people with families. These are people that you discard your normal image of an addict and insert the most normal, typical, whatever, healthy person you can imagine, because a lot of these people you wouldn't know were addicts. And then all of a sudden, you get this call. So and so is back in jail.

And are there certain people for whom it's hopeless? I mean, I don't like to hold the conversation that way, but I wouldn't be close to the real life data if I didn't ask. Is it hopeless?

And, of course, addiction is a spectrum disease. Right. And so you've got the severe end of things. Imagine that you had an itch somewhere on your body, okay? And it was. I mean, we've all had that, like, you know, whatever the source, it was super, super itchy. You can go for, you know, if you really focus, you could go for a pretty good amount of time not scratching it. But the moment you stopped focusing on not scratching it, you would scratch it. And maybe you do it while you were asleep. Right. That. And that is what happens to people with severe addiction. That balance is essentially broken. Homeostasis does not get restored despite sustained abstinence. They're living with that constant specter of that pull. It never goes away. So let me see. There are lots of people with addiction for whom that does go away, and it goes away at four weeks for many of them. But in severe cases, that's always there and it's lingering, and it's the moment when they're not focusing on not using. It's like a reflex. They fall back into it. It's not purposeful. It's not because they want to get high. It's not because they value using drugs more than they do their family. None of that. It's that really, they cannot not do it when given the opportunity. And that moment when they're not thinking about it. Does that make sense?"

And one of the goals of the nervous system is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive. So you don't have to make the decision, because decision making is a very costly thing to do, decision making of any kind. So that does really help. I want to just try and weave together this dopamine puzzle, however, because if by week. So first phase of this 30 or 40 day detox, it's like a dopamine fast. First ten days are miserable. Middle ten days, the clouds are out there, maybe some shards of sunlight coming through, and then all of a sudden, sun starts to come out. It gets brighter and brighter. Why is it then that people will relapse, not just after getting fired from a job or their spouse leaving them, but when things are going really well? Is it this unconscious mechanism? Because I've seen this before. They have a great win. I have a friend who's a really impressive, creative. I don't want to reveal any more than that. And relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity to create for the entire world. And I was like, how can that happen?

And the key thing about triggers, whatever they are, is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right? So just thinking about whatever the trigger is that we associate with drug use or just thinking about drug use can already release this anticipatory dopamine, this little mini spike. But here's the part that I think is really fascinating. That mini spike is followed by a mini deficit state. So it goes up and then it doesn't go back down the baseline. It goes below baseline, tonic levels, and that's cravings. Right. So that anticipation is immediately followed by wanting the drug. And it's that dopamine deficit state that drives the motivation to go and get the drug. So many people talk about dopamine is not really about pleasure, but about wanting and about motivation. And so it is that deficit state that then drives the locomotion to get it."

And I see this all the time. There are people for whom bad life experiences loss, you know, in any form, stress in many different forms, that's a trigger. But there are absolutely. People for whom the trigger is things going well. And the things going well can be like the reward of the things going well. But very often what it is is the removal of the hyper vigilant state that's required to keep their use in check. So it's this sense of, I want to celebrate, you know, or I want to. This reward happened. I want to put more reward on there. And it's really, really fascinating, because when people come to that realization about themselves that they're most vulnerable when things are going well, that's really a valuable insight, because then they can put some things in place or barriers in place or go to more meetings or whatever it is that they do, you know, to protect themselves."

Does a lot of important work in the kind of at risk youth community out in Hawaii. And he said something to me. He said, as former addicts often do, they got these great sayings. But I think it fits very well with what you're describing. He said, no matter how far you drive, you're always the same distance from the ditch. And I said, well, that's kind of depressing. And he said, no, that's actually what gives me peace. Because what would happen is for so many years of relapsing and relapsing, getting, recovering and relapsing, he felt like it was hopeless. And then somehow conceptualizing that the vigilance can never go away. Instead of making him feel burdened, it made him feel relieved. So I often think about that statement, no matter how far you drive, you're always the same distance from the ditch. Because in my mind, I conceptualize that as, gosh, that's a tough way to drive down the road. But actually on a road where you know where the ditch is and where you know where the lane lines are, it's actually a pretty nice drive. It's when you don't know where the shoulder is that you constantly have to be looking around. So there's this, we're speaking now in analogies and. And imagery and science. But one of the things I find so incredible about this community of twelve step, and there are a variety of them, or the communities that they create for themselves. And some of these sayings, which I do believe link back to really core biological mechanisms. Yes, yes, I do want to ask about those communities. I have a question which might be a little bit controversial, which is, is it possible that people who were addicted to drugs or alcohol or some gambling or some other behavior, get addicted to the addiction community. Because one thing that I think I observe over and over is that there's some circuit in the brain of human beings that has to tell you about the dream they had the night before. For whatever reason, there's another circuit that leads people to wake you up if they themselves can't sleep. I don't know what I'm being facetious here, but there does seem to also be a circuit in the brain of addicts to discuss and want to kind of talk about their recovery a lot. And I mention this not to poke at them, but rather the opposite, because I think that one thing that is challenging, at least for me, and having friends that have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction, not all of them, but certainly some of them, is when they're talking about the recovery, I feel like it's all they talk about. This meeting, that meeting, that meeting. How are we. So what I'm really asking here is that, can we become addicted to sobriety?"

You know, what is the way to live between pleasure and pain? And I implied earlier that ultimately we want a resilient balance that's sensitive to pleasure and pain, but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge, even when we indulge greatly. But the truth of the matter is that people with severe addiction, I believe, temperamentally want those extremes, and they're wired for that kind of intensity. That is more than just these slight adjustments around the fulcrum. Right. It's like they want the big highs and the big lows."

And my response to that is, because it's a cult is exactly why it works, okay? Because, yes, it is much better for you to be addicted to aa and to recovery than almost any other addiction I could think of. And we know from Rob Malenko's work, who's here at Stanford, that oxytocin is the hormone that's involved in human pair bonding and relationships and love, and it directly links to dopamine neurons and causes the release of dopamine. So, yes, when we connect with other humans, especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way, that's a huge dopamine hit. And it does replace the dopamine that people get from drugs. And for people who have this addiction temperament, they need it on a more intense level. They're not going to be generally satisfied with kind of, you know, a sort of acquaintanceship. Right. They. They want that intensity of the intimacy that you get with people when you're cathartically exposing, you know, warts and all. So, yes, people can get addicted to recovery, and good for them. Go for it, you know, and, of course, this can be disruptive for friendships and relationships where the one person is not in recovery. Like, you're going to so many meetings, you're always talking about recovery, but you know what? Much better than them being intoxicated, right?

        "text": "Yeah. So one of the things that I found really fascinating about working with people in recovery was how telling the truth, even about the merest detail of their lives, was central to their recovery. And I became really curious about that. Like, why would truth telling be so important? And, of course, there is the obvious thing, that when people are in their addiction, they're lying about using. So part of getting into recovery is to stop lying to the people they care about, about their use. But it's really more than that, because what people in recovery have taught me is that it's not even just not lying about using drugs. I have to not lie about anything. I can't lie about why I was late to work this morning, which we all do. Oh, I hit traffic. No, I didn't hit traffic. I wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper and drinking my coffee. Right. Or just lying about, I don't know, where I had dinner. So people with addiction will get into, you know, the lying habit, where they're lying about random stuff because they're sort of in the habit of lying, and how recovery is really about telling the truth, you know, in all ways. And so one of the things that I had a lot of fun with in writing the book is sort of exploring the neuroscience around why truth telling is important to leading a balanced life. And we know, like every religion since the beginning of time, is all about telling the truth. Well, why? Right. And there's really interesting neuroscience behind it that suggests that when we tell the truth, we actually potentially strengthen our prefrontal cortex, cortical circuits, and their connections to our limbic brain and our reward brain. And, of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected when we're in our addiction. Right. Our balance in our reward pathway, or limbic brain, our emotion brain, is doing one thing, and our cortical circuits are completely disengaged from that, ignoring what's happening, which is easy to do because it's reflexive. We don't need to think about that balance for the balance to be happening, but we have to reengage those circuits, anticipate future consequences, think through the drink. You know, not just how am I going to feel now if I use, but how am I going to feel tomorrow or six months from now? And that telling the truth is, in fact, a way to do that to make these connections stronger. And there I talk about some studies in my book that that kind of indirectly show that. So I find that really fascinating. Plus, just that, like, being open and honest with people really does create very intimate connections. And those intimate connections create dopamine. So we were talking a little bit about how, you know, a bunch of people who need, like, intensity in their lives. For me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections, like, I'm really not interested in and bored by and made anxious by casual interactions. But having this kind of discussion with you that's very intense and also intimate and self disclosing is very rewarding for me. So that's an important source of dopamine. Thank God I became a psychiatrist."

But there's also this element about, do you report previous lies? Right. Like, what about prior behavior? And I'm fascinated by this because to me, telling the truth has many facets. But the three sides of this thing, in my mind are, one is reporting everything accurately. The other is, what do you withhold? What do you not withhold? Right.

So how important is it for the addict or every person really, because it sounds like cultivating the circuitry between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system would be great for anybody. Since we're all addicted, everyone should do it. But in all seriousness, it sounds like a good thing for everybody to do. How much work needs to be done on all the priors, all the stuff we've hidden, and I mean, not me, but all the stuff that everybody else has."

So the, you know, the steps of the twelve steps of alcoholics Anonymous, a good number of those steps are about that very thing, the past, the ways that we've harmed people in the past. And the fourth step is about making amends by admitting the ways in which that we've contributed to harming others. And it is a really big piece of recovery. So how important for people with addiction, it's really, really important to go back and make amends. And the key idea there is you just go back and you apologize and you don't have to get any particular kind of response or you don't need to be forgiven. It's the act itself of apologizing about the ways in which we've harmed or lied to people in the past that is cathartic and renewing and allows us to kind of shed this skin and be new in our lives and begin again, sort of absolved of past sins, so to speak. So it is really important, are there situations when it's maybe not a good idea because of that person or the nature? Sure, there are always going to be, it doesn't have to be like we're talking about, not like Kant's idea about never lie robbers in your house. He's, you know, you're stowaway. You can't lie even about that. It's like, no, there are probably situations."

So this idea of like Catharsis and, well, I mean, in the twelve steps, it's telling God or your higher power, telling another human being the ways in which you've wronged others, considering your own character defects and how those have contributed. To me, that's a really important piece and something that we don't do enough in our current culture, especially in psychiatry, frankly, where there's a lot of eternally empathizing with patients, but not a whole lot of likes going well. You know, actually, you kind of messed that up, or, like, that was really bad on you. You know, and in my work, I don't necessarily use that language, but, you know, patients may say, like, I really feel badly about, you know, this thing. I'll be like, yeah, I get it.

People going out of country because I think it's still illegal here, or is illegal here, going out of country to, I don't know, either inject it or smoke it or whatever it is, or people going and doing ayahuasca journeys, or MDMA, which is still an illegal drug in this country. But there are clinical trials. There are people on this campus doing experimental studies. I don't know of clinical trials, but at Johns Hopkins, there are clinical trials, etcetera. So this is a vast area, right? Different chemistries for different drugs and different purposes. But the rationale, as I understand it, is take people who are in a pattern of addiction, launch them into a experience that's also chemical and extreme, often of the extreme serotonin and or extreme dopamine type. So MDMA ecstasy, for instance, tons of serotonin, dumped. Tons of dopamine dumped. How neurotoxic, if neurotoxic, debatable, etcetera, etcetera. Not a topic for now, but a lot. And then somehow that extreme experience wrapped inside of a supported network in there, whether or not there's just someone there, or whether or not they're actively working through something with the patient, is supposed to eject the person into a life where drug use isn't as much of interest. This violates, at a rash, purely rational level, this violates everything we've talked about in terms of dopamine biology. It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it, cause more addiction is anything but a dopamine fast. It's a dopamine feat. So we hear about successful transitions through this, at least anecdotally, and maybe some clinical say, what is going on? What is going on doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah."

It's sort of, instead of doing like a year of psychoanalysis where you're sitting on the couch every week reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy, plus MDMA, which gets."

So I think it takes, it's like when it works, it's a transformational experience. It gives the person another lens through which to view their life, their lives, which I think for some people is positive and powerful because they can come back from that and be like, oh my gosh, I care about my family and I want x, y or z for them. And I realize that my continuing to drink is not going to achieve that. So it's almost like a spiritual or values based. So I think it can be very powerful. But having said that, I truly am quite skeptical because, you know, addiction is a chronic relapsing and remitting problem.

That's a disaster and almost never works out well. And I've then had people who literally, supposedly you can get addicted to psychedelics because, you know, something with the biochemistry, which I don't fully understand because it doesn't make any sense to me, but I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted to, you know, MDMA, to microdosing.

And I actually have great optimism for this business of clinical use of psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins is doing fabulous work on this, and there are others too, of course, but those are controlled settings and the pharmacology is being tuned up. And one thing that I think is coming, there are several papers published recently in great journals like Nature and Science, etcetera, where there are scientists who are removing the hallucinogenic components of these drugs and finding that they still have the antidepressant effects. And so the experience of a psychedelic and the long term effects of the psychedelic might actually be dissociable.

If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing, something that's making our lives worse or our us less functional at work and in relationships, I could imagine a version of social media where it's making me more connected. I mean, this is a podcast, after all. I post videos. This will show up on YouTube and elements of it on Instagram as well, so much like sugar or other things. I have to imagine that we need to regulate, not necessarily eliminating this behavior.

And so that means with intention and in advance, planning our use. Right. And trying to use it as a really awesome tool to potentially connect with other people and not to be used by it or get lost in it. And of course, you know, people are going to come with different propensities for addiction to any drug, and that's true for social media too. Some people will have no problem using it in moderation or using it in a way that's adaptive and other, other people will immediately get sucked in.

So I think our collective challenge, and it should be our mission, is to make sure that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways to connect with each other. Because if we don't do that, then we'll be very lonely. Right. If we were not online, but if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with, none of whom are on their phones, while you're together for that discrete amount of time, then it's wonderful and liberating, and nobody's distracted.

Then there's the fomo is less if you're missing out, because. Because, oh, you're all doing the dopamine fast together. So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with."

Think of literal physical and metacognitive barriers that you can put between yourself and your phone or whatever your drug is to create these intentional spaces where you're not constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, and distracting yourself. Because I really do think, you know, I think we talked just before we, we started with the interview. You know, we're losing the ability to have a sustained thought. Right. I mean, we get so far, and then you get to that point in the thought where it's a little bit hard to know what's coming next. And it's very easy to check your phone or check your email or look something up on the Internet, and then you never get that opportunity to finish that thought, which is really the source of creative energy and an original thought.

And if our competence in that arena is threatened, we would all experience a narcissistic injury. And that's normal and healthy. But we are living in a narcissistic culture. I mean, that's not news. This preoccupation with individual achievement and individual self worth and individual self confidence. And I think all of that is just fueled by social media, where we're not just seeing ourselves, but we're seeing people's reactions to ourselves and every single thing we say or do, we get likes and this and that. It's really insidious and it contributes, I think, ultimately to lot of personal shame, because we're not really meant to be individuals bouncing around in the universe, we're social animals, and we're probably generally happiest even for natural contrarians among us when we're part of a tribe, right. And if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves from that tribe, I think that the brain's natural and instinctive corrective mechanism against that is self loathing and shame. So, you know, it's so ironic because the, the culture tells us if we just achieve more, we'll like ourselves more. But the truth is actually the opposite that I think when people get these pinnacles of personal achievement, you know, you have things like the imposter syndrome or."

And also people who have amazing, stoic paths to get here coming from very little accomplishing so much. But it's also the pressure, right. You know, the way that this career was described to me the day I got my job was one colleague of mine, the late Ben Barris, said, welcome to schizophrenia, because you're never going to be able to complete anything without getting interrupted. That was partially true, although I've created buffers. And the other one very successful scientist, a member of the national Academy, et cetera, said to me, you know, just remember, it's pinball.

And I think this, you know, this really, I think, is related to our discussion earlier about this, taking it one day at a time or paying attention to that, you know, 24 hours period in your environment. I am absolutely fascinated by the ways in which we accumulate success when we do that, totally independent of the desire for success, it's really process oriented. It's like, where am I today? How can I make today a good and meaningful day a little bit better or as good as some other days? I've had constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment that we call our human existence. And when we do that in a way that's authentic and paying attention and value driven, whatever our, you know, values are informed by, it is very, very interesting how those days, again, accumulate and you find, wow, I guess I contributed something of value there, but I wasn't trying to do that. You know, I think that's really. I mean, what I'm so amazed by is like, you know, 20 years ago, when I went to Stanford Medical School, 25 years ago, you know, I just. I was happy to just be a good doctor. I was like, I guess I'm just gonna try to figure out how to be a good doctor, and I'm here to learn that. And now I. I see these medical students, and they're wonderful, they're brilliant, and they're well intentioned, all that, but they're like, how can I write the great american novel? Do my startup go to Africa, apply for that grant? It's like, really, I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor. And as you say, it's a lot of pressure on them. And it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging of the real way to accomplish something which isn't about like, oh, how can I accomplish something? It's like, what can I do today? That would be of service, right? And then finding that of trying to be of service, you know, and not really going for recognition, can sometimes lead to what people call success. Although that wasn't what you were aiming."
