        "text": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Doctor Peter Attia. Doctor Attia is a physician who's focused on nutritional supplementation based behavioral, prescription drug and other interventions that promote health span and lifespan. His expertise spans from exercise physiology to sleep physiology, emotional and mental health, and pharmacology. Today we talk about all those areas of health, starting with the very basics such as how to evaluate one's own health status and how to define one's health trajectory. We also talk about the various sorts of interventions that one can take in order to optimize vitality while also extending longevity, that is, lifespan. Doctor Attia is uniquely qualified to focus on the complete depth and breadth of topics that we cover, and indeed, these are the same topics that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day. Doctor Attia earned his Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics and his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine. He then went on to train at Johns Hopkins Hospital in general surgery, one of the premier hospitals in the world, where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards, including resident of the year. He's been an author on comprehensive reviews of general surgery. He spent two years at the National Institutes of Health as a surgical oncology fellow at the National Cancer Institute, where his work focused on immune based therapies for melanoma. In the fields of science and medicine, it is well understood that we are much the product of our mentors and the mentoring we receive. Doctor Attia has trained with some of the best and most innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists, gynecologists, sleep physiologists, and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada. So the expertise that funnels through him and that he shares with us today is really harnessed from the best of the best and his extensive training and expertise. By the end of today's episode, you will have answers to important basic questions such as should you have blood work? How often should you do blood work? What specific things should you be looking for on that blood work that are either counterintuitive or not often discussed, and yet that immediately and in the long term influence your lifespan and health span? We talk about hormone health and hormone therapies for both men and women. We talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind as well as the body. And of course, we talk about supplementation, nutrition, exercise and predictors of lifespan and health span. It is an episode rich with information. For some of you, you may want to get out a pen and paper in order to take notes. For others of you that learn better simply by listening, I just want to remind you that we have timestamped all this information so that you can go back to the specific topics most of interest to you. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium. The so called electrolytes and no sugar. Salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons. In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly, all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios, and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance. Element contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams. That's 1 gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium. I typically drink element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes. And while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, if you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element. That's lmnt.com Huberman to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkelement lmnt.com dot Huberman today's episode is also brought to us by waking up. Waking up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga, NiDRa sessions, and NSDR non sleep deep rest protocols. I started using the Waking up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens and I started doing yoga Nidra about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app. Turned out to be the waking up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations, and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much. So I gave the waking up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate. And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on the which meditation I do. I also love that the waking up app has lots of different types of yoga Nidra sessions. For those of you who don't know, yoga Nidra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind. It's very different than most meditations, and there's excellent scientific data to show that yoga Nidra and something similar to it called non sleep, deep rest, or NSDR, can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy, even with just a short ten minute session. If you'd like to try the waking up app, you can go to wakingup.com huberman and access a free 30 day trial. Again, that's wakingup.com huberman to access a free 30 day trial. And now for my discussion with Doctor Peter Attia. Peter, thanks for joining me today."

So what are your thoughts on blood work? Is it necessary for the typical person? So this is somebody who's not dealing with some acute syndrome or illness. And at what age would you suggest people start getting blood work? How frequently should they get blood work? How often do you get blood work done, et cetera?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, there's a lot there. I mean, the way I talk about this with patients is first taking everything back to the objective. So what's the thing we're trying to optimize. So if a person says, look, I'm trying to break 10 hours for an ironman, I don't know that blood work is going to be a game changing aspect of their trajectory and their training, you know, they're going to benefit much more from sort of functional analyses of performance. So I'm assuming, based on the question, that you're really coming at this through the lens of living longer and living better through the lifespan. Healthspan lens."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah. And just, I think most people have some sense of their vitality or lack of vitality, but I think everyone wonders whether or not they could feel better and whether or not blood work will give them a window into how they might go about feeling better."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I think it does to some extent, but I also think that it has a lot of blind spots. So I kind of, you know, break things down into the two vectors that make up longevity, which are lifespan and healthspan. So lifespan is the easiest of those vectors to understand because it's pretty binary. You're alive or you're not alive, you're respiring or you're not, you make ATP or you don't, end of story. So what gets in the way of lifespan is essentially the four horsemen of disease, right? So atherosclerotic disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disease, which directly isn't the cause of many deaths, but basically creates the foundation to all of those other diseases. So if you're a non smoker, what I just rattled off is about 80% of your death. So how does blood work help address those? It varies. So on the atherosclerotic standpoint, it's a very good predictor of risk if you know what to look for. Uh, so primarily, ApoB would be the single most important, um, lipoprotein that we care about, I think. Explain what that means in a second. Um, and then also, you know, other markers of inflammation, endothelial health, and metabolic health. When it comes to cancer, blood testing in the sense of biomarkers, is not particularly helpful outside of knowing that the second leading environmental or modifiable cause of cancer is metabolic ill health after smoking. So we dont actually know a lot about cancer in the sense of what causes it. Its really stochastic and its a lot of bad luck. So we know that smoking drives it, and we know that even though epidemiologically we say obesity drives it, what it really means is metabolic poor health. It's probably the hyperinsulinemia that comes with obesity that drives it. So biomarkers help with that, but there's still an enormous blind spot to cancer. We could talk about liquid biopsies aside, because those aren't really biomarker studies, but put that away. On the neurodegenerative side, I don't think we have a lot of insight that comes to understanding Parkinson's disease. But when it comes to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, which is the most prevalent form of dementia, I think the biomarkers can be quite helpful. They overlap a lot with the atherosclerotic diseases. So the same things that drive the risk of heart disease are driving the risk of dementia. And then there's some novel stuff as well. If you include genetic testing, which you can get out of a blood test, we get a whole suite of genes, not just apoe, but far more nuanced stuff than that, that can also play a role. So you can stratify risk in that sense. So in aggregate, I would say blood testing of biomarkers provides pretty good insight into lifespan. When you get into health span, you have the cognitive, physical, emotional domains. I think here the biomarkers are far less helpful and here we rely more on functional testing. So when it comes to the cognitive piece, you can do cognitive testing in terms of long term risk, a lot of the things that imply good cognitive health as you age are in line with the same things that you would do to reduce the risk of dementia. So all the biomarkers that you would look to improve through dementia risk reduction, you would be improving through cognitive health. On the physical side, I mean, outside of looking at hormone levels and things which we look at extensively, and understanding how those might aid in or prevent some of the metrics that matter, it really is, this is a biomarker aside thing. I mean, I'd be much more interested in a person's Dexa CPET testing, vo two max testing, zone two lactate testing, fat oxidation, those what I would consider more functional tests that give me far more insight into that. And then of course, the emotional piece, which, depending on who you are, might be the single most important piece, without which none of this other stuff matters. If youre a totally miserable human being, your relationships suck. I dont think any of this other stuff matters. And certainly theres nothing that Im looking at in biomarkers thats giving me great insight into that."

But I definitely think of it as an important part of what we do. And I think without it, none of this other stuff really matters. Again, the irony of thinking about how many years I spent sort of in pursuit of fully optimizing every detail of everything without any attention being paid to that dimension is not lost on me. And, look, there are some patients who. That's just not something. That's something that's compartmentalized. Maybe they're doing well in that department, or maybe they aren't, but they just aren't willing to engage on that yet."

    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "Yeah, I mean, look, I certainly think everybody should be screened early in life, because if you look at, like, what's the single most prevalent genetic driver of atherosclerosis is LP. So, unfortunately, most physicians don't know what LP is. And yet somewhere between eight and 12% of the population has a high enough. And depending on who you know, I had a recent guest on my podcast who suggested it could be as high as 20% have a high enough lp that it is contributing to atherosclerosis. So to not want to know that when it's genetically determined, right. This is something that, know you're born with this, and you only need to really check it once. Why? We wouldn't want to know that in a 20 year old, when it can contribute to a lot of the early atherosclerosis we see in people, it's leaving money on the table. In my opinion. The frequency with which you need to test really comes down to the state of interventions. I don't think it makes sense to just do blood tests for the sake of doing blood tests. There has to be a reason. Is something changing? A blood test is, for the most part, a static intervention. It's a look at a window in time, and there's benefit in having a few of those over the course of a year if you're unsure about a level. So if something comes back and it doesn't look great, yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it without reacting to it. But typically in patients, we might check blood two to four times a year, but we're also probably doing things in there to now check, like, hey, we gave this drug. Did it have the desired outcome, you put on three pounds of muscle and lost three pounds of fat. Did it have the desired outcome?"

Maybe I'm making a huge mistake. What are your thoughts about quantitative measurements of weight BMI for the typical person?"

And so, with a Dexa, you're getting at least the way we look at the data for pieces of information. Now, most people, when they do a Dexa, should I explain what that is?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "A",
        "text": "Yeah, I think some people might not know what Dex is. In fact, I confess I have a crude understanding of what it is. Tell me where I'm wrong, and hopefully where I'm at least partially right. My understanding is that there are a number of different ways to measure lean mass to non lean mass ratio. There's one where they put you underwater. There's one where they put you into some sort of non underwater chamber. There's calipering, and then there's the looking in the mirror and pinching and changing the lighting."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It's funny if you've done it enough. I can tell my body fat by my abs. I can sort of tell by how good the six pack or how bad the six pack is, what the leanness is. And that's actually not a terrible way to do it. A bodybuilder, for example, which I've never been, can tell you the difference between being 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, just based on the degree of visibility within the abs. But basically, a Dexa scan is an x ray. So it's the same principle as just getting a chest x ray, where ionizing radiation is passed through the body, and there's a plate behind the body that collects what comes through. And the denser the medium that the electrons are trying to go through, the less of them that are collected. So when you look at an x ray, as everybody's probably seen an x ray, that which is white is most dense. So if you had a piece of metal in your pocket, it would show up as a bright white thing. That's why ribs and bones show up as white. And the things that are the least dense like the lungs, where it's just air, are the blackest, and everything is a shade of gray in between. So Edexa is just doing that effectively. But it's a moving x ray. So you lay down on a bed and it takes maybe ten minutes, and this little very low power x ray kind of goes over your body. And the plate beneath it is collecting information that is basically allowing it to differentiate between three things. Bone mineral content, fat, other. And the other is quantified as lean body mass. So that's organs, muscles, everything else. So when most people do Edexo, they get the report back. And the reports are horrible. I've yet to see one company that can do this in a way that isn't abjectly horrible. We've created our own templates, so we have our own dashboard for how we do this, because we've just given up on trying to use theirs. But the first thing most people look at is, what's my body fat? And this is the gold standard outside of, like, MRI or something that's only used for research purposes. So a Dexa is going to produce a far better estimate of body fat than calipers or buoyancy testing or things like that, provided the machinery is well calibrated and the operator knows how to use it. Um, I've heard some people argue that in the hands of, like, the guy who's been doing calipers his whole life, it can probably be comparable with calipers. But nevertheless, for an off the shelf tech, you know, Dexa is amazing. You know, of the four things that get spit out of the Dexa, we think that the body fat is the least interesting. And so I would rank that as fourth on the list of what's germane to your health. The other three things that you get spit out are bone mineral density, visceral fat, and then the metrics that allow you to compute, basically compute what's called appendicular lean mass index and fat free mass index. And so those three metrics are significantly more important than body fat. And the reason is as follows. Bone mineral density basically speaks to your risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia. And that doesn't sound very sexy to people our age. You know, 50 year old guys listening to this, it's like, yeah, big deal. But for a 50 year old woman, this is a huge deal, right? A woman who's just about to go through menopause, or has just gone through menopause, is at an enormous risk for osteopenia. And then ultimately, osteoporosis, because estrogen is the single most important hormone in regulating bone mineral density. And we can come back and talk about why that's the case. But it's very interesting how the biomechanics of bones work and why estrogen specifically is so important, and this is a huge cause of morbidity. So if you're over the age of 65 and you fall and break your hip, your one year morbidity is about 30% to 40%, which, again, just to put that in English, if you're 65 or older, you fall and break your hip. There's a 30% to 40% chance you're dead in a year."

So a z score of zero means, and you understand this, but it's like it's z score referring to a probability distribution in a standard mode. So z score of zero means you're at the 50th percentile for your age in sex. A z score of plus one, you're one standard deviation above minus one, below, et cetera. There's also a t score, which is doing the same thing, but comparing you to a young person. And so the t score is technically used to make the diagnosis of osteopenia, osteoporosis. We tend to look more at the z score and basically say, look, if your z score right now is minus one in four years, I want your z score to be zero. Not necessarily because you've increased that entire way, but maybe you've increased slightly while it's expected that you would have declined."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "It turns out there's a real critical window in which we are malleable. So, depending on the age at which someone's listening to us discuss this, um, you know, if you're. If you're under 2025, you are still in that time of your life when you are able to reach your potential. So, um, it turns out that strength training is probably the single best thing you can do. And this was a surprise to me because we, you know, we did an AMA on this topic a little while ago, and that's when I got, you know, really deep on this with our analysts. My assumption was running must be the best. Like some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do. It was, you know, I assumed running would be better than swimming and cycling, but it turned out that powerlifting was probably the best thing you could do. Um, and I think once you understand how bones work, it became more clear, which is, you know, powerlifting is really putting more of a shear force from the muscle via the tendon onto the bone. And the. That's what the bones are really sensing. They're sensing that shear force that's being applied through the bone in a compressive way, depending on the bone, of course. And that's what's basically activating the osteoblasts, which are the cells that are allowing bone to be built. So this turns out to be probably more important for females because how high you can get during that period of development, say, until you're 20 or 25, basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your life. So where we get into real trouble is with patients who, for example, used large amounts of inhaled steroids during that period of their life because, let's say, they had really bad asthma or patients who needed large amounts of corticosteroids for some other immune related condition. So during their critical window of development, they were taking a drug that was impairing this process. So we have some patients like that in our practice, and that's just an enormous liability that we're working really hard to overcome with nutrition, with hormones, with drugs, with training, and it's just something you have to be aware of."

I mean, we're mostly concerned with people that are taking even modest amounts of prednisone for months, years at a time. Or like I said, kids that are using steroid inhalers for years and years and years. Again, I'm not suggesting that if your kids on a steroid inhaler, they shouldn't be. You have to solve the most important problem and if asthma is the most important problem, so be it.

I think there's pretty good agreement across the fields of physiotherapy, et cetera, of physiology and medicine in terms of how to do that. But my understanding is fairly low repetition ranges. So this is anywhere from one to six repetitions, typically not aiming for a pump, hypertrophy, that sort of thing, but heavy loads that are hard to move. 80% of one repetition maximum or more done with long rest periods, um, three, two to, you know, three times a week type thing.

Yeah, you do need to be kind of moving against a very heavy load. Now, again, that can look very different, depending on your level of experience. Like, I really like deadlifting now. I mean, I can count the number of days left in my life when I'm going to want to do sets over 400 pounds, but I'll pick and choose the days that I do. But I grew up doing those things. I'm comfortable with those movements. If I had a 60 year old woman who's never lifted weights in her life who we now have to get lifting, we could get her to deadlift. But I think I wouldn't make perfect the enemy of good. I'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine and just get her doing that. It's not as pure a movement as a deadlift, but who cares? We can still put her at a heavy load for her and do so safely. So now, that said, I mean, there was a study that was done in Australia, and hopefully we can find a link to it. There's a video on YouTube that actually kind of has the PI sort of walking through the results. I could send it to you afterwards."

And it is remarkable to watch these women. They're doing good mornings, they're doing deadlifts, they're picking heavy things up off the ground. I think one woman was picking up, God, I want to say she was like picking like 50, 60 kilos up off the ground. I mean, just staggering sums of weight for these women who have never done anything. And their bone health is improving at this age. So the goal, frankly, is to just never get to the point where you have to do this for the first time. Strength training is such an essential part of our existence that it's never too late to start, but you should never stop."

She actually used to be really strong when we were kids. She could move this fish tank that was in my room long before I could move it. She's really strong over the years. I wouldn't call her frail by any means, but I certainly think she could benefit from some strength training. Let's say she were to start doing some leg presses or start even with air squats and maybe work up to some pushups. Are the effects all local. Meaning if she were to just train her legs or just do push ups, would it only be the loads applied to the limbs and muscles and tissues that were involved?"

Now, not all of the insults, I've seen people that have, you know, because of horrible bone density, they're, they're, you know, they're fracturing ankles and tibia, fibula, like, they're having low tib fib fractures, just walking. So clearly, bone density outside of those regions does matter, but much of it is really focused on, and by the way, you fall, you break a wrist. So this is a systemic issue, but the majority of the response is a local response because it really comes down to putting a load directly on that bone and then having that bone in kind respond by laying down more bone."

Athletic greens, now called ag one, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking athletic greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking athletic greens, and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day, is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health. And those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to try athletic greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com Huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greenshouse while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, etcetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D. Three K two. Again, that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D. Three K two. You mentioned falling and the problems with falling and breaking things and mortality related to that. I wonder whether or not there are also health related effects of just having weak bones that are not just about falling and breaking a bone. And I dying a year later. That's obviously very severe because I think when people hear about that, some people might think, well, I'll just be more careful. I'll just move more slowly. I'll sit in a wheelchair if I need to, even though I might be able to walk if it keeps me from falling. Some people, I think, adopt that mentality. What are some of the benefits of having high bone mineral density for men and women that are perhaps independent of risk of injury?"

And I think until you do that, all of this other stuff is just abstract and kind of nonsense until a person can tell you what it is that they want to be doing in that last decade. You can't design a program to get them there. I mean, think about it. Someone wants to do an iron man. We take it for granted that we know what the objective is. I have to be able to swim two and a half miles. I have to be able to get out, take my wetsuit off, hop on my bike, ride 112 miles, get off my bike, take the bike shoes off, put the run shoes on, run 26.2 miles. We get it. We know what the objective is, and only by knowing that can you train. Can you imagine if I said to you, andrew, I'm going to have you do an athletic event in a year, start training. I'm not going to tell you what it is, just do it. It could be playing basketball, it could be swimming to Catalina island, it could be running 100 miles. You wouldn't be able to do it.

So you described doing a whole bunch of things. Okay, just to let you know, to do that will require a vo two max of 30 oxygen per minute per kilogram. And the person will say, okay, what does that mean? Well, say, well, that's a measure of your maximal uptake of oxygen, and that declines at about 8% to 10% per decade. So if you have to be at 30, and let's just assume you're going to be doing that at 90. So what do you need to be at? 80, 70, 60, 50. Okay, here's what it would need to be at 50. Okay, what are you now? Ah, there's a big gap. You're below where you need to be now. So you're obviously higher than 30 now. But if you're only at 42 now and you need to be at 30 in 40 years, you're not going to cut it. You have to be a lot fitter. Okay, now let's do the same exercise around strength and stability. And without exception, most people when they do this exercise will find out they're well below where they need to be. So the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize. And therefore, the height of your glider needs to be much higher than you think it is when youre our age, if you want to be able to do the things we probably want to be able to do when were 90."

And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM, or all cause mortality is it's really agnostic to how you die. And that doesn't always make sense. I mean, if you're talking about a very specific intervention, like an anti cancer therapeutic, you really care about cancer specific mortality or heart specific mortality. But when we talk about these sort of broad things, we like to talk about ACM. So, using smoking, smoking is approximately a 40% increase in the risk of ACM."

So it's important to distinguish. It doesn't mean your lifespan is going to be 40% less. It means at any point in time, standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher. Um, and by the way, that'll catch up with you, right? At some point, that. That catches up. Um, high blood pressure. It's about a 20% to 25% increase in all cause mortality. You take something really extreme, like end stage kidney disease. So these are patients that are on dialysis waiting for an organ. And again, there's a confounder there, because what's the underlying condition that leads you to that? It's profound. Hypertension, significant. Type two diabetes that's been uncontrolled, that's enormous. That's about 175% increase in ACM. So the hazard ratio is like 2.75. Type two diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well. So 25% increase. So now the question is, like, how do you improve? So what are the things that improve those? So now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers and other metrics. So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass, what is the improvement? And it's pretty significant. It's about three x. So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people as they age, the low muscle mass people have about a three x hazard ratio, or 200% increase in all cause mortality. Now, if you look at the data more carefully, you realize that it's probably less the muscle mass fully doing that, and it's more the high association with strength. And when you start to tease out strength, you can realize that strength could be probably 3.5 x as a hazard ratio, meaning about 250% greater risk if you have low strength to high strength."

And I don't even think they're the best metrics. So they're usually using, like, grip strength, leg extensions, and, like, wall sits squats, things like that. So how long can you sit in a squatted position at 90 degrees without support? Would be a great demonstration of quad strength, a leg extension. How much weight can you hold for how long relative to body weight, things like that. We have a whole strength program that we do with our patients. We have something called the SMA. So it's the strength metrics assessment, and we put them through eleven tests that are really difficult. Like a dead hang is one of them. Like, how long can you dead hang your body weight? Stuff like that. So we're trying to be more granular in that insight. But tie it back to these principles. If you look at cardiorespiratory fitness, it's even more profound. So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25% for their age and sex in terms of Vo two max, and you compare them to the people that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile. You're talking about a two x difference, roughly in the risk of ACM, if you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%.

And I want to know, every single type of input. And I want to have a clear sense of via, what mechanism does it offer, what mode of protection? And it took Dan, and this was obviously, we iterated a lot on this together. And he came back with kind of an amazing presentation that took, I don't know, nine months to a year of work. And what amazed me was, when he came back to it, he said, the single greatest efficacy we can point to is exercise. And I was like, dan, that's gotta be nonsense, dude. There's no way exercise is the single best thing you can do for the brain. There has to be some drug you've missed. There has to be some other thing that you've missed. And he's like, no. Like, this is hands down the best thing because you're, you know, it's not just what it's doing to BDNF. It's not just what it's doing to vascular endothelium. It's not just what it's doing to glucose disposal and insulin signaling, all these things. Like, it's just touching every aspect of the brain. And I was very skeptical for about six months. Kind of really pushed on him, and I was like, I think you're missing something, Dan. I think you're missing something. And then finally, in the end, looped in Richard Isaacson, whos a neurologist that we work with really closely on Alzheimers prevention. And ultimately, it turned into a paper that we wrote basically about this topic and a few others, because, again, I thought, are you sure its not EPA and DHA thats got to have a bigger impact? And again, theres a lot of things that I think do matter, and theres a whole host of things that we do for Alzheimers prevention. But I think youre absolutely right. Theres not one thing that ill tell patients is more important than exercising. And by the way, it's not the sort of pathetic recommendations that are made. You have to exercise a lot more if you want to get this maximum benefit. You will get the maximum benefit. Comes going from nothing to something. So if you go from being completely sedentary to doing 15 Met hours per week, you'll get probably a 50% reduction in risk. So a Met hour, a Met, just for people who don't know, is a metabolic equivalent. So we're exerting about 1.3 mets sitting here talking. If we were sitting here being quiet, it would be about one met. Walking really briskly would be about five Mets. So 15 Met hours per week would be three 1 hour really brisk walks that's not a lot of work, but just going from doing nothing to doing that would give you 50% of the benefit that you would get from going all the way. Now, again, I think I'm personally a little skeptical of how much that's. I think it's probably a bit less than that. I think there's more upside than people appreciate. But the studies I don't think can truly capture that. But look, you know, there's, there's no reason to not be exercising more than that and capture more benefit, even though the rate at which you accrue it is less. And it also speaks to the health span side of this, which is not necessarily captured in those data. The health span gets back to the functional piece we opened with, which is what do you want to be doing in your marginal decade? Do you want to be able to pick up a great grandkid if they come running at you? Do you want to be able to get up off the floor? Do you want to be able to play on the floor with a kid and then get up on your own?"

I'll use anecdote, as it's now called, to cite just I know three Nobel Prize winners, which doesn't mean anything except that they did beautiful work. But the point is that they're all in their nineties. So I'll name them because complimenting them for what they've done, not just their work, but what I'm about to describe. So Eric Kendall at Columbia, Nobel Prize winner for work on memory, Torrence and Wiesel, who work on neuroplasticity. And then Richard Axel, who's also at Columbia, Nobel Prize winning work for molecular biology of smell and molecular biology generally, all three of them still alive. Richard's younger compared to the other two. All three of them either swim, jog, or play tennis or racquetball, I think is Richard's thing multiple times per week. Eric was they're all cognitively still extremely sharp, still interested in the arts, doing science, curious about science, running laboratories, writing books, going on podcasts. I mean, it's incredible. Again, that's anecdote but I was kind of surprised to learn that colleagues that were so intellectually strong were also so obsessed with exercise. I mean, they really are obsessed with their exercise routine, and early on linked that to their, some of their intellectual vigor over time. I want to just also use that as a jumping off point to ask about one kind of niche thing. But it comes up. I don't think I'm going to out which one of those told me this, but one of those three individuals choose an excessive amount of nicorette, used to be a smoker. And I asked him why, and he said because in his estimation, it's protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, or at least the nicotinic acetylcholine augmentation of nicotine, because nicotine is an acetylcholine receptor, obviously is known to create a state of focus and neural enhancement. What are your thoughts about not smoking? Let's just, I want to be really clear. People don't smoke nicotine, vape, nicotine, it's going to shorten your life. Just terrible idea, addictive, et cetera, in my opinion. But what are your thoughts about augmenting acetylcholine through the use of nicotine in order to keep the brain healthy and focused? Again, this is one Nobel Prize winner, so it's truly n of one. But he's so convinced that this matches up with the mechanistic data on acetylcholine and cognition that I'd love to hear your thoughts on it."

Our mutual acquaintance David Sinclair mentioned a company to me a year ago. Hes like, hey, have you heard of this company? And I forget the name of the company, but he gave me some name. So I go online and its like this company selling nicotine and im like I wonder why hes asking me to do this. Well, ill just order a bunch and then well figure out why? Because there was some reason we were doing this potentially through investment. So I get up, like, literally ordered, like a lifetime supply of this stuff. And it's pretty good. It's actually, it's a really nice little patch. Because the thing I didn't like about the gum was I hated just the taste of it. So then the next week, I'm talking to David, and I'm like, by the way, I ordered all that nicotine stuff you told me about. He's like, what? And he goes, oh, the company's name was something else. It was totally unrelated. It's like, oh, God. So the short answer is, I think this stuff is absolutely a concentration enhancing substance. It is addictive, and people need to be wary of that now. It's not addictive to everybody. I personally experience no addiction to it whatsoever. So I could do it every day for 30 days and stop and experience no withdrawal. I could forget about it. It doesn't really seem to matter. You have to be careful with the dose, truthfully. I mean, remember, one cigarette is about 1 nicotine, and a lot of these lozenges will plow four to eight milligrams into you in one shot. And for someone who is, you know, naive to that, like I am, four milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bolus. So you just have to be very mindful of it. I got a lot of flack when I did this ama, for obvious reasons. But people were like, how can you, as a doctor, encourage people to use nicotine? And I was like, first of all, I'm not encouraging anybody to use it. I just want to be able to talk about the biochemistry of it. Um, and if disclosing that I use it from time to time is, is an endorsement, then, you know, I apologize for that. Um, but on the list of things that you can do to make your brain a little more focused, I would consider this infinitely safer than what a lot of people are doing, which is using stimulants. I mean, to me, I just tell patients outright, like, we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants. I mean, yeah, we're not giving anybody Adderall, we're not giving anybody Vyvanse or any of these things, not to say they don't have an inappropriate clinical use, but they should be prescribed under the care of somebody who's really monitoring the use case for it. And using that as a tool to enhance concentration and cognitive performance is not something we're comfortable doing."

I mean, I was in college when mosaic launched in the early nineties and you had to walk a mile to get to the computer lab on a big sun workstation to do anything in some computer code language. So when you're sitting in your room studying, there was no distraction. And I think that's a far greater component of what it means to be focused than the challenges we have today. My thoughts on this would be if we really wanted to return to a state of focus, we're going to have to individually do something about our environment, and I don't know what the answer is.

I'm not recommending it, but it's clear that augmenting the acetylcholine system, which is what nicotine does in its various forms and some related type pharmacology does enhance focus and pretty potently. So I think it's going to be an interesting area for real clinical trials and things of that sort. Love to chat about hormone therapies and hormones generally. When Robert Sapolsky came on the podcast, we talked a little bit about menopause and the data around menopause. He's very interested in these findings that I think I'm going to get this right, that whether or not women benefit from estrogen therapy to offset menopause really depends on when that therapy is initiated. I don't know if you're aware of those data, but he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy in the middle to tail end of menopause, the outcomes can be quite bad. Whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies as they enter menopause or even before menopause, then the outcomes can be quite good. I don't know what percentage of the patients you treat are male versus female and what ages those patients are, of course, but what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy for women? Menopause and hormone therapy is generally for women, maybe even testosterone therapy. You hear about that these days, and then we'll talk about men."

        "text": "So what's happening to a woman from the age she starts menstruating until she goes through menopause outside of pregnancy and birth control and stuff like that? Is she has this cycle roughly every 28 days, but it can vary where at the beginning of her period, we call that day zero her basic. Her estrogen and progesterone are very low, you can't measure them. And then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise and it rises in response to a hormone called follicle stimulating hormone. Follicle stimulating hormone fshdeheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh that is getting her ready to ovulate and she ovulates at about the midpoint of her cycle. So if were just going to make the math easy, on day 14, shes going to release a follicle from one of her ovaries and the estrogen level is sort of rising, rising, rising. We love to measure hormones on day five because I want to have a standardized way in which I measure her hormones. So our women know if were in the business of trying to understand her hormones the day her period starts, even if its just a day of spotting, that becomes our benchmark. And then day five, I want to see every hormone on that day. And if everything is going well, I know what her fsh, lh, estradiol and progesterone should be on that day. So the estrogen rises, starts to come down a little bit as she ovulates and then the luteinizing hormone kicks on because it's now going to prepare her uterus for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy. So now you start to see estradiol go back, but now for the first time, progesterone goes up. So progesterone has been doing nothing for 14 days and now it starts to rise. And actually progesterone is the hormone that's dominating the second half, which is called her luteal cycle. So the first 14 days is the follicular cycle, second is the luteal cycle. So once you get to about the halfway point of that, which is now just to do the math, 21 days in the body has figured out if she's pregnant or not. And again, most of the time she's not going to be pregnant. So the body says, oh, I don't need this lining that I've been preparing, I'm going to shed it. So now progesterone and estrogen start crashing and the lining is what is being shed. And that is the menses, by the way. It's that last seven days of that cycle that in a susceptible woman is what creates those PM's symptoms. So actually, this is something that you would probably have a better understanding of than me. There is something about this in a susceptible woman where the enormous reduction of progesterone so quickly is probably impacting something in her brain. So I think this is a legitimate thing, right? I mean, it's not like, oh, she's crazy because she's having all these PM's symptoms. No, um, we know that that's the case because if you put women on progesterone for those seven days, those symptoms go away. So if you can stabilize their progesterone during the last half of their luteal phase, and sometimes we would just do it for the entire luteal phase, just put them on a low dose of progesterone, all PM's symptoms vanish."

So I'll take a look. I think some insight into what that progesterone emotionality link might be and where it might exist, neural circuit wise."

        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So then when the estrogen and progesterone reach their nadir again, that starts the cycle. So that just, that cycle is happening over and over and over again. Okay, so it became, you know, well known in the fifties that, okay, a woman's gonna stop menstruating at some point, her estrogen goes down. Why don't we just give her estrogen? Because that's clearly gonna help with some of the symptoms of menopause. So what do women experience when they go through menopause? The first symptoms are what are called vasomotor symptoms. So this is usually in the form of night sweatshi hot flashes. And depending on the woman, this can be really significant. Right. These are women who can have a hard time sleeping. They can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day. They can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat. Those tend to pass after a couple of years, and then they get into the more long term complications of menopause. So what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago, which is the osteopenia, osteoporosis, a lot of women will complain of brain fog. So, I mean, clearly this was an issue, and it was recognized 70 years ago. Why don't we give women estrogen back to replace that hormone? And so that went on for a couple of decades, maybe less, maybe a decade. And then it was realized, wait a minute, we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer. And the reason for that is, if you just give estrogen with no progesterone to antagonize it, you will thicken the endometrium endlessly, and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia. Well, you'll definitely undergo hyperplasia. And then ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia is precancerous. And ultimately, we were seeing that. So people figured out, well, actually, if you want to give estrogen to a woman who still has her uterus, you have to give her progesterone as well. You have to be able to have a hormone to oppose the estrogen. And then that became effectively in the 19, call it the 1970s ish, the standard for HRT. So in the early 1990s, the NIH said, look, we haven't really studied this. We have a ton of epidemiology that says giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things. They feel better, so all their symptoms go away. They seem to have lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of, lower risk of cardiovascular disease, lower risk of bone fractures. Everything seems to get better, lower risk of diabetes. But we haven't tested this in a randomized, prospective trial. So let's do this. So that became the WhI, and it randomized. It had two parallel arms. So it had a group for women who did not have a uterus. So these are women that had undergone hysterectomy for some other reason. And then it had a group for women that did have their uterus. In the first group, there was a placebo arm and then an estrogen only arm. And in the other group, there was a progesterone plus estrogen versus a placebo. Everything about the way this study was done is a bit wonky. Some of it is justifiable, but it's important to understand, first, the women were all way outside of menopause. So none of these women were started when you would normally start HRT. And there were probably several reasons for that. But one of them is, and I think this is a legitimate reason, they wanted hard outcomes. They wanted to know death rates. And if you're doing this on women in their fifties, you just weren't going to get it right. You couldn't wait too long. Yeah, you got to wait too long. And this was only going to be like a seven to ten year study. So they had to do this on women who were much older. They also disproportionately took much sicker women, I believe the prevalence. And again, I'm going to get some of these numbers wrong and people are going to get all phosphorylated. But, I mean, I'm in the ballpark, right? Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous. So they really disproportionately picked the most unhealthy population they could that was pretty advanced in age. And again, I think part of that was to say, look, we want to make sure that after seven years, we really know if there's a difference in these causes of death. The other thing is, this is kind of weird, although, again, I understand their rationale for it. But this is a great example of. Be very careful when you look at a clinical trial that it remotely represents the patients you're interested in treating. So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic. The rationale being, if we include in the study patients who are symptomatic, those who are randomized to placebo will drop out."

Like today, when we put women on estrogen, we use a, it's an FDA product called the vivel dot. So it's a patch that you just put on, and it's estradiol, but it's bio identical estradiol. And we used what's called micronized progesterone. So bio identical progesterone. And she said, well, at the time, we just wanted to test what was currently being used. And I said, totally makes sense. But again, now you have four considerations that you have to keep in mind. Okay? So despite those four considerations, and I'm going to make a case for you why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study, the synthetic progesterone. When the preliminary results were first made available, but not yet peer reviewed and not yet published, there was a huge fiasco, huge press announcement about it, suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA in the group with the uterus had a higher incidence of breast cancer. Cancer. And that basically became the headline. That never went away, though it turned out not to be true. Let's talk about the numbers.

And that became the only headline, HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%. Now, I don't think that's true at all today, but let's even look at the data. What was the ARR? What was the absolute risk increase? It was a difference between five cases per, 1004 cases per thousand. And so the ARR was 0.1%, one case in 1000.

I'll tell a woman today, we're going to start you on this. When you're going through menopause, we're using bio identical hormones, and if your upper bound risk of breast cancer is one case in 1000, you should at least weigh that against all of the other benefits, which I'll talk about now. There's something else I want to say, because a moment ago I alluded to the fact that I think the MPA might have been the biggest issue in that study. So there were two findings in that study that were negative. One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease and the small increase in the risk of breast cancer. But consider the other group we forgot about, the group that didn't have a uterus, because, remember, those women got estrogen only versus placebo. What was the difference in breast cancer there? Well, this is interesting because it didnt reach statistical significance, but its p value was zero six or zero seven. So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction. It was a 24% risk reduction, about one in 1000 as well. So when you had estrogen plus MPA, you had barely statistically significant. The p value was 0.05, so it just hit statistical significance, one in 1000 cases for breast cancer, and then you had one in 1000 cases. But p value of 0.07 for reduction of risk of breast cancer, which to me suggests that the MPA, the synthetic progesterone, was playing more of a role than anything else. The second thing I point out is oral estrogen, which we no longer use, does increase coagulability. It does increase the ability of the blood to clot a little bit. And when we look at the more recent data on HRT using topical estrogen or patches of estrogen, we don't see that at all. In fact, we see the opposite now. So now we see the risk of heart disease going down in women with."

So here's where we still struggle, right, is, you know, we, if it were up to me, I'd prefer for a woman's HRT to be provided by her gyn, because we want to be able to work in partnership with the gyn, who we would like to see an endometrial ultrasound done every year. That's, you know, some would argue that's overkill, but, you know, we think she's having a pap smear every year as well. So if were looking at the cervix, we want to look at the endometrium, we want to make sure the lining isnt too thick. The other thing I should say, andrew, is today we now realize that not all women can tolerate estrogen, pardon me, progesterone. So you have to be careful. So assuming again, a woman still has her uterus, the estrogen solves most of the problems. But then you have to decide, can she tolerate the progesterone? And it needs to be, if given systemically, like 100 to 200 milligrams. And for some women, that is a life saving intervention. I mean, they start sleeping better, their hair gets thicker, they feel better, but for some women, it literally drives them crazy. Its probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing in the case of women with PM's. So in those situations we say, great, were done with oral progesterone. We just use a progesterone, coded IUD. So then you get the local progesterone in the uterus for protection and the systemic estrogen."

When one looks on social media and the Internet, there seems to be a younger and younger cohort of guys, people in their teens and twenties, showing up to the table thinking that injecting testosterone cypionate or taking anivar or whatever it is, is going to be the right idea. They mainly seem to be focused on cosmetic effects. I'm not a physician, so I can't say whether or not they were actually hypogonadal, et cetera, but it seems to me, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that similar to the attias rule as it relates to longevity, that we could come up with a broad contour rule in which if a male of any age is not trying to get decent sleep, exercise, appropriately appropriate nutrition, minding their social connections, et cetera, et cetera, the idea of going straight to testosterone seems like a bad idea. That said, just like with depression and antidepressants, there is a kind of a cliff after which low enough testosterone or low enough serotonin prevents people from sleeping, exercise, social connection, et cetera. So I do want to acknowledge that. But with that in mind, how do you think about and perhaps occasionally prescribe and direct your patients in terms of hormone replacement therapy in men, person in their thirties, person in their forties, who's doing almost all the other things correctly, what sorts of levels do you think are meaningful? Because the range is tremendous in terms of blood tests, 300 nanograms per deciliter, I think on the low end now in the US, all the way up to 900 or 1200. That's an enormous range. What are some of the other hormones you like to look at? Estrogen, DHT, and so on."

I used to spend more time looking at total and free when I used more tricks to modulate it. So I'm actually far more simple in my manipulation of testosterone today than I was six or seven years ago.

But Anavar has such a high affinity for SHBG that it basically distracts your SHBG from binding your testosterone, freeing up testosterone. That's exactly right. So the goal was, how do I just give you more free testosterone? So if a patient shows up and they've got a total testosterone of 900 nanograms per deciliter, which would place them at, depending on the scale you look at the scale we look at, that would place you at about the 70th percentile. But your free testosterone is eight nanograms per deciliter. So thats pretty bad. That means youre less than 1% free. A guy should be about 2% free tea. So that dude should be closer to 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter. So in that situation that I just gave you, his SHBG is really high. His SHBG is probably in the 80 to 90 range."

But from a hormone perspective, theres basically three hormones that run it, estradiol being probably the most important, insulin and thyroxine. So were going to look at all of those and decide if any of those are playing a role. So insulin suppresses it. So this is actually the great irony of helping a person get metabolically healthy, is in the short run, you can actually lower their free testosterone, all things equal, because as insulin comes down, shbg goes up. And if testosterone hasnt gone up with it, youre lowering free testosterone."

Um, so again, occasionally you'll see a guy with incredibly normal testosterone, but he's a very high aromatase activity person. So he has a lot of the enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol. You can lower estradiol a bit with an aromatase inhibitor, and that can bring down shbg. Now, again, these things individually are rarely enough to move the needle. Uh, the last is thyroxine. So if you have a person whose thyroid is out of whack, you have to fix that before you. If their t four is out of whack, you're going to interfere with shbg. There are also some supplements which I think you've probably talked about these on the podcast.

And I've been perusing it line by line. But I love input from experts like you on the use of tonga Ali for reducing HBG. In my experience, it does free up some testosterone, by which mechanism it isnt exactly clear and the effects arent that dramatic. There are probably multiple effects. For all we know, it increases libido, and it does generally by way of increasing estrogen slightly, which can also increase libido in some individuals. So we dont know the exact mode of action. So weve talked about a few, the one that a few years back people were claiming could reduce SHBG. Washing, stinging netting, nettles. Stinging nettle. Well, just urine seems to be urinating, seems to be coming up multiple times on this podcast for whatever reason. Stinging nettle extract I took, the most pronounced effect of that was you could basically urinate over a car when taking SHBG. What the underlying mechanism of that was, I do not know. I took it for a short while. It didn't drop my shbg very much, but it did drop my DHT sufficiently so that I stopped taking it. I do not like anything that impedes DHT. I dont care if my hairline retreats. I dont care about any of that. DHT, to me, is something to be coveted and held onto because you feel so much better when your DHT is in the appropriate range.

But then I had one patient once who, even though we told him about 87 times that he was swallowing the anavars and his liver function, and he was, we're talking ten milligrams, three times a week is a tiny dose. And three months of him or whatever, two months of him swallowing that every time, tripled his liver function test. So it's like. It's just. I was like, you know, it's just not worth the hassle of doing this for, you know, perfection. In reality, we can fix this another way. So. So the first order question is, do we believe clinically, you will benefit from normalizing your free testosterone or taking it to a level, let's call it 80th to 90th percentile? So upper normal limit of physiologic ranges. That's the first order question. And that's going to come down to symptoms, and that's going to come down to some biomarkers. I think there's. Two years ago, was it two years ago or maybe a year ago? Very good study came out that looked at pre diabetic men. You've probably talked about this study and looking at insulin resistance and glucose disposal with and without testosterone, and the evidence was overwhelmingly clear. Testosterone improves glycemic control. Testosterone improves insulin signaling. This shouldn't be surprising, by the way, given the role muscles play as a glucose reservoir and a glucose sink. So now I include that as one of the things that we will consider as a factor for using testosterone. Now, again, it's not the only one. So you can accomplish that with exercise, you can accomplish that with these other things, but then you get into a little bit of the vicious cycle of will having a normalized testosterone facilitate you doing those things better? So let's just assume we come to the decision that this person is a good candidate for testosterone replacement therapy. The next question is, what's the method we're going to do it? Are we going to do it indirectly or directly? Now, we used to use a lot of clomid in our practice. And have you talked about Clomid on the podcast?"

        "text": "In the. In the way that cholesterol is made. It's made by. There's two pathways that make cholesterol. So it starts with two carbon subunits, like acetyl CoA, and it kind of marches down a pathway, bifurcates. And cholesterol is the finished product of both. But in one of those pathways, the molecule right before cholesterol is called desmosterol. In the other pathway, it's called lethosterol. So we constantly measure lethosterol and desmosterol because we want to know how much cholesterol is being synthesized in the body, not just what your cholesterol is, we want to know how much cholesterol you reabsorb. And those markers are really important to us when we're looking at cardiovascular disease risk. So when we gave patients clomid, we were noticing a almost universal rise in their desmosterol level. Now, the most obvious explanation for that, though the last time I looked, I couldn't find clear explanation for this in any of the clinical, like the clinical trials that led to the approval of clomid. So I don't know if it was described. In fact, maybe it wasn't known. I suspect it is inhibiting the enzyme, which I think is called delta 24 desaturase, that turns desmosterol into cholesterol. Makes sense. If you inhibit that enzyme, you're going to see a rise in desmosterol. This wouldn't have been a concern to me if not for the fact that Tom Dayspring, who's one of the physicians we work with, who's one of the world's experts in lipids, pointed out a very obscure story, which was that the very first drug ever approved to treat cardiovascular disease, at least to treat hypercholesterolemia, was a drug that attacked the same enzyme. So this was in the early 1960s, I believe, maybe the mid sixties, this drug was approved and it lowered cholesterol. And it was approved on the basis of lowering cholesterol. Now, today, no drug for ASCVD is approved on the basis of it lowering cholesterol. That's not a high enough bar. You have to reduce events, you actually have to show that you're preventing heart attacks and death. But at that time it was like, hey, it lowers cholesterol, it's got to be good. Well, in the late sixties, it was pulled from the market because events were going up. So cholesterol was coming down, events were going up. How could that be? We dont know. What we are suspecting is that desmosterol, which is still a sterol, was potentially more damaging and created more oxidative stress in the endothelium, in the subendothelial space than cholesterol, which would at least suggest to us, and again, were taking a lot of leaps here, that maybe having high desmosterol, very high desmostrol, is not a good thing. And so once we kind of pieced all that together a few years ago, we were like, yeah, we're just not going to prescribe clomid anymore. And we then switched to hcG, which we used to use sometimes instead of clomid, but it's more cumbersome to work with. It needs to be refrigerated. It's a much more fragile molecule."

And after talking about this, a number of people went out there, did pre and post blood work, and the consistent effect seems to be an increase in luteinizing hormone. There's a noticeable effect on testicular size and volume. So a lot of people take this and be like, oh, you know, they're.

This should just give you a greater ability to experience muscle protein synthesis. So if I just give you a bunch of testosterone and you sit on the couch and your nutrition doesn't change and you're not exercising anymore, you're not going to experience any benefits of this thing. I mean, my testosterone level has fluctuated quite a bit throughout my life. And when I think about as an adult, not sort of including when I was sort of a fanatical teenager, but as an adult, when was I at my absolute most insane physique? Like, my best performance on a Dexa scan would have been 30. I was 38 years old by Dexa. I was 7% body fat. My fat free mass index was like 23.223.3 kg/meter squared. I mean, I was huge, strong and totally ripped. My testosterone was in the toilet. I was overtraining like crazy. I was exercising probably 26 hours a week, killing it in the gym, swimming like a banshee, cycling like my life depended on it. Grossly overtrained, low t, but physically looked like twice the guy I am today. Today, my tea is probably twice as high as it was then. Now you could say, well, Peter, what if you took tea back then? How much better could you have been? Sure. Um, but.

But most people are operating under the assumption that eating saturated fat is bad and you only do it insofar as you want to taste it.

        "text": "So first, let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat, just for the listener, because we use them. I don't want to make sure people understand. So cholesterol is a really complicated molecule. So it's a ringed molecule. God, I used to know exactly what its structure was, but it could have 36 carbons for all I remember. It is a lipid. So it is a hydrophobic molecule that is synthesized by every cell in the human body. It is so important that without it, if you look at genetic conditions that impair cholesterol synthesis, depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero. So in other words, anything that really interferes with our ability to produce cholesterol is a threat to us as a species. And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up the cell membrane of every cell in our body. So, as you know. But maybe the listeners don't. Even though a cell is a spherical thing, it has to be fluid, right. It's not just a rigid like sphere like a blow up ball. Right. It's got to be able to kind of move in this way to mesh with other cells. It also has to accommodate having porous structures that traverse its membrane to allow ions and things like that to go across. And it's cholesterol that gives the fluidity to that membrane. It's also, as you're alluding to, the backbone of some of the most important, important hormones in our body, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol. So we have this thing super important. Okay, then let's talk about can you get cholesterol in your diet? Yes. You can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol. What was known in 1960, but somehow escaped everybody's imagination until finally the American Heart association acknowledged this a few years ago, is that the cholesterol you eat does not really make it into your body. And the reason for that is it's esterified. So we have, and not to get too nerdy, but I think people, I think if, I really think it's important people understand how this thing works. So we have cells in our gut and enterocytes that they're the endothelial cells of our gut. Each one of them has basically two transporters on them. So the first is called the niemannpic c, one l, one transporter. The second is called the ATP binding cassette G. Okay. The Niemann pick c, one l, one transporter will bring in any sterol, cholesterol, zusterol, phytosterol. Any sterol that fits through the door will come in. Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce that gets taken back to the liver, that the liver packages in bile and secretes. So that's what aids in our digestion. Which is another thing I should have mentioned earlier. In addition to using cholesterol for cell membranes and hormones, we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol because it's what makes up the bile salts. So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated in a pool throughout our body. And this is the way it gets back into the body. It's through this Niemann pixie one. Like one transporter. When it gets in there, the body, this is the checkpoint of regulation. This is where the body says, do you have enough cholesterol in the body. Yes or no? If yes, I will let that cholesterol make its way into the circulation. So it'll go off the basolateral side of the cell, not the luminal side, into the body. Alternatively, the body says, you know what? We have enough cholesterol. I'm going to let you poop this out. And now the ATP binding cassette will shoot it out. It'll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes. All of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified, meaning it doesn't have that big, bulky side chain attached to it. The cholesterol you eat is esterified, and an esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass through that. Niemann Pick C, one l, one transporter. Now, we probably manage to de esterify ten to 15% of our dietary cholesterol. So in other words, there are small amounts of dietary cholesterol that do make their way into our circulation, but it represents a small fraction of our total body's pool of cholesterol. Again, this was known even by Ancel Keys, the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogeyman of all time. Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol. So again, it took the American Heart association another 60 years to figure that out. But even now, they acknowledge that dietary cholesterol has no bearing."

Saturated fat and red meat, things that are rich in cholesterol, to be more specific, is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "B",
        "text": "So this is two different things. So saturated fat consumption in many people will raise LDL cholesterol. So it's important to differentiate between the what is saturated fat? So saturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid, just so people understand, totally different molecule from cholesterol. Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA saturated fat is just a long chain fatty acid that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds and it can exist in isolation. It can exist in a triglyceride, triacylglyceride, or a phospholipid, or all sorts of things like that. So when we eat foods that contain fat, basically there are three distinctions for that fat. Is it saturated, is it monounsaturated, one double bond? Or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds? The observation that eating saturated fat raises cholesterol is generally correct. But again, now it makes. Because if we're going to start talking about LDL, we have to explain what LDL is. This is another one of those things that's just so grossly misunderstood that it makes having discussions about this very complicated. Let's go back to the cholesterol problem. So every cell in our body makes cholesterol, and almost without exception, they make enough. There are a handful of times, however, when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell. Okay, so how would you do this? Right? So if you're playing God for a minute and you want to design a system, you have to be able to transport cholesterol from one cell to another. The most logical place you would transport this is through the circulation. And the problem with circulation is it's water. Plasma is water. So now you have this problem, which is, I want to transport cargo that is hydrophobic in a hydrophilic medium. Can't do it. So if you think about all the things that we transport in our blood, sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, they're water soluble. It's easy. They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone. But when you want to move cholesterol, you have to package it in something that's hydrophilic. That something is called a lipoprotein. So we have these spherical molecules that are lipid on the inside, protein on the outside lipoprotein, and inside they contain cholesterol and triglycerides. Now you've got the spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside, and it's chaperoned by a hydrophilic molecule that allows it to move through our circulation. And those lipoproteins exist in different densities. So if you run these out on a gel electrophoresis plate, you'll identify different densities. The density is a function of how much protein and how much lipid is in it. So the highest density of this is called a high density lipoprotein. And the lowest density of this is called a very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL. And then next to that you have an LDL, a low density lipoprotein. And then next to that you have an idL, an intermediate density lipoprotein. So, you know, it actually goes vldl, idl, ldl. But anyway, so when people say my ldl is high or my ldl is 100, what are they saying? They're saying the cholesterol concentration of my LDL particles is 100 milligrams per deciliter. So the total cholesterol concentration you have in your circulation is that number that says total cholesterol. So if someone's blood panel says my total cholesterol is 200, it means that if you take all the lipoproteins in their circulation, bust them open and measure the cholesterol content, it's 200 milligrams per deciliter. And for all intents and purposes, because the idls are so short lived, that's basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol, your VLDL cholesterol and your HDL cholesterol. Those three things sum to your total cholesterol."

So we treat APOB, and basically what it comes down to is you want APOB to be as close to the level as it was when you were born. So we start developing heart disease when we're born. That's just the way it is. The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear. When you look at autopsies of young people who are dying in their twenties, and this was first done in the 1970s, it was again repeated again, it's always done after we have a war, right. So in the 1970s it was done on people, you know, who died in Vietnam in the early two thousands. It was done on mostly young men, but some young women who were dying in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we saw without any ambiguity that cardiovascular disease is already taking hold in people who are 18, 1920 years old."

So anything that reduces cholesterol and reduces triglycerides is going to reduce apob. Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake. So more insulin resistance, more carbohydrate intake, more triglycerides. So we. I mean, clinically, this is readily apparent to anyone who treats patients. If you restrict carbohydrates, you will reduce triglycerides. That. That just happens all day long. But if you reduce triglycerides by raising fat intake so much, it can still raise apob. So. So you have to be able to think about it. So. So in an ideal world, it's, can you lower saturated fat, which tends to be the one that is most driving apoB, while lowering carbohydrate, and then see what you can get?

When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis, the liver says, I want more cholesterol, so it puts more ldl receptors on its surface, and it pulls the ldl out of circulation. That's what lowers the ldl in the circulation. So, again, nine statins in use today, we typically use four of them. The side effect profile, contrary to all the statin hating propaganda out there, very benign, right? 5% of people experience muscle soreness, which reverses, upon cessation."

No. But if you look at clinical trials, there's no evidence whatsoever that statins impair cognition. There's also no evidence in clinical trials that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease. In fact, it's the opposite of. Now, there's a very nuanced case we make, Andrew, which is we'll look at patients with highly suppressed desmosterol levels. We will back off. We do want to maintain desmosterol above a certain level because of some evidence that is still, I think, very preliminary, but enough for us that we say, why take the chance? We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol. Why would we over suppress synthesis in a susceptible individual? So the next tool you look at is a drug that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption of cholesterol. Remember that Niemann pixie one, like one transporter? So that guy has a drug called ezetimibe that just mechanically blocks it. So, in people, and that's why I mentioned earlier, we measure all those sterols in people. So we also measure things called phytosterols. And the phytosterols give us an indication of how active that transporter is. So the higher your phytosterols, the more likely you are to respond to zetimib. Next class of drugs is a drug that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver. So the statin does it globally. This other drug called bempanoic acid, does it only in the liver. So it has a very similar mechanism to statins. Different enzyme, not quite as potent, but way fewer side effects. So any patient that's having a response to statins that's adverse, we'll try this other thing."

Typically, their total cholesterol level is 300. Their LDL cholesterol is typically north of 200 milligrams per deciliter. This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype, not the genotype. So the phenotype has a very clear definition, which I basically just gave you. The genotype is there's a million paths to get there. There's over 3000 mutations that are known to produce that phenotype. This was discovered to be one of them in people who had hyper functioning Pcsk nine, this protein was just constantly hammering and destroying the LDL receptors. And so their ldl would be huge, and by extension, their total cholesterol would be. So in 19. Sorry. In 2006, Helen Hobbes and colleagues discovered an opposite group of population, people who had LDL cholesterol naturally of ten to 20 milligrams per deciliter, which would be an apob of about 20 milligrams per deciliter, and who never got heart disease. They were immune to heart disease no matter how long they live, and they had the opposite. They had hypo functioning PCSK nine.

And there's a whole chapter in my book I'm working on that really gets to this problem of why aren't we looking at atherosclerosis in terms of treating the causative agent? Instead, we look at modifying ten year risk. So that's the fundamental difference between what I call medicine 2.0 and medicine 3.0. Medicine 2.0, which is what we're generally practicing today when it comes to ASCVD, says, look, we will treat you, we will lower that ldl cholesterol. They still don't talk about Apob, but that's a very American thing. If you go outside of the United States, everybody's talking about APOb. It's in the guidelines in Europe and Canada, everywhere else. The United States is very stubborn on this, and it's due to a couple of really weird personalities in the lipid world. But the paradigm is when your ten year risk reaches 5%, when there's a 5% chance that you're going to have a heart attack, stroke or die in the next ten years, now it's time to treat you. Medicine 3.0 says that's not the way to think about it. You treat the causative agent. If there's a causative agent, you treat it. If blood pressure raises the risk of heart disease, you lower blood pressure. If smoking raises the risk of something, you treat smoking. And the reason that the risk model is so bad when you're looking at ten year risk, is age is the biggest driver of risk. I mean, bar none, right? So if you take a 70 year old with perfect lipids and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything, their ten year risk of ASCVD is probably four to five times higher than the most unhealthy 30 year old.

That makes my life easier, and it makes the problem I'm solving easier. I don't have to answer the quality adjusted life year problem.

The esoteric question relates to something that I think is a little bit niche, but not necessarily so, which is peptides and stem cells in PRP.

And a mutual friend of ours, not to be named, sent me a text and said, I'm going to be talking to Attia. And what do you know about studies on things like BPC 157, this gastric peptide that anecdotally, again, anecdotally, people report getting injections of this in the shoulder, knee, et cetera, and feeling so much better, so much faster. But there really aren't good studies, controlled studies, and you hear all the same sorts of things about platelet rich plasma, PRP, which if someone tells you there are a lot of stem cells in them, they're lying. There are not a lot of stem cells in them. And you also hear about stem cells which are not FDA approved, at least in this, you know, for most uses in this country, but are certainly people are flying down to Colombia and getting injections. And what is your understanding or experience with things like BPC 157 specifically because peptides is a huge landscape. We should probably do a whole episode on peptides, things like PRP. PRP is now approved for. I mean, women are getting injections of this into their ovaries to improve follicle count. We know this. People are getting injections of PRP into every tissue and organ. Hell, men are getting injected in their penis. So I hear, for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me. What's the deal with PRP, BPC 157 and stem cells? Do you ever see interesting effects? Are you curious about these compounds? Do you prescribe or direct people towards these? The FDA approved ones?"

PRP less so, but certainly stem cells and peptides. And I just think if you're going to do something without a clinical trial, you got to show up with a lot more data. So let's use rapamycin as an example. I'm a huge proponent of rapamycin, and you can say, well, Peter, how can you take or prescribe rapamycin for geoprotective effects when we do not have a human clinical trial demonstrating that it lengthens life? And the answer is because I have 84 other pieces of data that all point in the same direction across every model organism going back more than a billion years. And thats really different from Joey, Sammy, and Sally did this thing, and I think it works and they just cant be compared. Now. I have no idea if stem cells work. I have no idea if BPC 157 works. I have no idea, frankly, if PRP even works, though, it might seem to have some efficacy and some indications. For example, maybe when it comes to early hair loss, maybe when it comes to certain joint issues. But the reality of it is, I think we just have to accept the fact that everything we do has an opportunity cost, and that opportunity cost, sometimes financial, but I actually find a lot of times it's in time and effort and energy that goes into something. Now, when I was waiting to get my shoulder surgery, this is an injury that I've had forever. This is an injury. This injury was actually probably the greatest source of discomfort. I had swimming the Catalina channel the last time in 2009. So that tells you how long I've had this injury. But I sort of knew at some point I'm going to have to have it fixed. And I went down this rabbit hole like, hey, is there anything I can do to avoid having surgery. Would infusing a million stem cells into it work? And in speaking with as many orthopedic surgeons as I could, the answer was kind of unambiguously no. And by the way, it doesn't mean you wouldn't feel better if I injected a bunch of stem cells into your shoulder. There are a lot of reasons that might make you. You feel better, just like there are a bunch of reasons you can feel better if somebody injects saline directly into your joint. So the question is, is it going to fix the underlying problem? And if so, will it do so by what mechanism? So I'm pretty sure that if you took a thousand people with my particular injury and injected them with stem cells, it wouldn't do a thing. Because of the nature of my injury, I had a complete labral tear. Are there some injuries that might benefit from it? Yeah, possible. So the question is, how would you design the trial to narrow down your patient population correctly so that you might see a signal? Because the other risk of doing a trial is you have too much of a heterogeneous patient population. You don't know what the heck you're really doing, and you get meaningless results. You get a null result when in fact, there's a small signal, but you were underpowered to pick it up because you only had 10% of your patient population. That was the right patient population to get that. So will we ever get there? I don't know, because I don't see what the incentive is. You have people who are making money hand over fist, doing procedures on the basis of. I'm not sure what. What would their motivation or incentive be to sort of see this legitimized? You'd really have to be able to say, well, there really needs to be sort of a pharma angle to this. It's sort of one of the wishes I had, right? Like, if I was a billionaire, I feel like the way I would probably waste all of my money would be running clinical trials on stuff nobody cared about."

And what's missing is a billionaire or a billion dollar company that is willing to invest in something that very likely will work. The market value isn't quite there or it failed in a previous trial, and so no one wants to touch it with a ten foot pole. Hopefully someone listening to this will be incentivized to provide this sort of venue for that. The kind of work that we're talking about. I have to ask, but I want."

It's sort of like what we talked about with like, hey, just fix my t man, and everything's going to be fine. And it's like, no, that's just the beginning. You know what I worry about when I see people who are clamoring for this stuff is a lot of times they don't realize that, whether it's psychologically or otherwise, they sort of say, well, now that I've had this thing done, I don't have to do the hard work of the real rehab. I mean, if I've learned anything through my shoulder surgery and I'm now three and a half months out, how does it feel? Amazing. I mean, look, I still can't do a lot of stuff. It's going to be, you know, a while. I haven't even been able to shoot a bow yet. And it'll probably be a year before I'll go back to long dead hangs and heavy deadlifts. I mean, I don't know, maybe nine months, but I'm not there yet. But what I learned through a really amazing pre hab and rehab process is like, you just got to do the work and it's freaking hard. Shoulders are the most tedious, boring thing in the world. I mean, three days a week I am doing, four days a week I am doing 1 hour of just dedicated stuff for this shoulder that is super uncomfortable, super boring, super frustrating. But I have faith in the methodology. I think a lot of people are saying, just shoot the stem cells into me and I dont have to do any of that stuff. The reality of it is, I think that's a very dangerous place to be."

We're talking about this before we sat down to record what is, what are metabolomics? Why should we be thinking about them? I have some idea of what it might be about, but most people, I think, are not thinking about metabolomics at all. And for those that are, I'm sure they could learn more. So tell us about metabolomics and what you'd like to see more of in the world of metabolomics. Yeah."

        "text": "So omics is just the term that we use to describe the study of something. So genomics, right, is like the broad study of genes and, you know, proteomics, the broad study of proteins and things like that. So metabolomics is the study of metabolites and metabolites, unlike a lot of these other things, there are a relatively finite number of these things, many of which are known, but some of which are not known. So glucose is a metabolite, acetyl CoA is a metabolite, lactate is a metabolite. And so the question is, what do we know about these things and how they work? And more importantly, what do we know about certain physiologic states and the metabolomic profile that results from them? So let's use two extreme examples like exercise. Everybody understands the data are unambiguously clear. Exercise produces about the most favorable phenotype imaginable. So if you wanted to take a genomics approach to understanding that, you might look at, is there a change in the genome when you exercise? And the answer is probably not. But maybe if you looked at the methylation patterns in epigenome, you could look at epigenomic studies, but you might instead look at the proteomic side of that. What is gene expression doing there? You would see a lot of changes. Well, what I don't think people are really understanding, although there was a very interesting paper that just came out two weeks ago that looks for novel metabolites that are changing. Is there a huge signal in a metabolomic profile that looks different in the state of exercise versus non exercise? And could that represent part of how exercise is transmitting its benefit through the body? People always talk about the holy grail of metabolomics would be, can you find a pill to mimic exercise? And I think the answer to that question is going to be undoubtedly no, for a couple of reasons. One, even if you could mimic the longevity sort of lifespan parts of it, you could never mimic the health span parts of it. But what if you could do both? Right? What if there were small molecules that can replicate some of the protective benefits of exercise and you could combine those with exercise? What if those could be treatments for other disease states like diabetes, things like that? So that's why I think this field of metabolomics is relatively untapped and I think, you know, potentially the next sort of frontier."

And it was mostly young women, I think, were getting horrible pulmonary disease as a result of it, probably pulmonary hypertension or something like that. But there were two enantiomers of the drug, and had they just used the other one, this issue wouldnt have happened. And there was a stupid reason why they made the choice to use the one they did. And its one of those things where once you make the mistake, youre never going back. Its not like that company could say, okay, we want to do over, but were going to do it with the right version. So it's a tragic outcome. But you're absolutely right. I think the GLP one agonists have more efficacy and for all intensity and for everything we can see, certainly seem safer."

So if you're looking at semaglutide, the dose that was studied, so did a one year trial, or maybe it was a little over that, maybe 60 weeks, but it took about 16 weeks to get the patients comfortably up to 2.4 milligrams weekly, which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on. In our experience, when we use it, we don't even usually go up to 2.4 milligrams. We can usually get enough benefit between one and two milligrams, and we usually move people along a little bit quicker.

So theres newer versions that seem to preserve the weight loss even off the drug. So it begs the ultimate question, which is like, what's the total use case for this going to be? Is this going to be a drug you cycle on and off, or is it going to be a drug that a person has to stay on indefinitely? And if so, will they become tachyfylactic? Will they gain, you know, a resistance to it? So it's still super early days on these things."

So, you know, for example, like, you know, we. We always encourage patients who want to lose weight to really just eliminate alcohol. Like, that's, like, that's the cheapest, easiest trick to lose weight. And so if you're still drinking a lot of alcohol, which is incredibly caloric, and just drinking a lot of caloric stuff, we've seen that that's less. This is just anecdotal with our patients, but we've seen that it's easier to get around the benefits of the drug that way."

But I see you really as one of the few, both clinicians, and I realize you're an MD. Did you do a PhD as well? No, but I consider you a scientist. Clinician. Clinician. Scientist is the appropriate wording of that, of course, in the way that you really still drill into studies in detail. I know a lot of clinicians, not all of them do that for sure. And the fact that you're so hungry for the new incoming knowledge as well as the old literature. So it's an incredibly rich data set in that brain of yours, and I really appreciate you sharing it with us both in your podcast in the upcoming book, which I think that we'll certainly have you on here again in anticipation of that.
