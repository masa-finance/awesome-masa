1. Starting point: JSON file (`data/tweets.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "ConversationID": "1775858583231439117",
    "Username": "Trader_XO",
    "Text": "@MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90",
    // ... other fields ...
  },
  {
    "ConversationID": "1815797777462616202",
    "Username": "Trader_XO",
    "Text": "@TraderMagus Grifters are efficient that much I can tell you for free \n\nParticularly the ones who have found their balls again after a 15k move up off the lows",
    // ... other fields ...
  }
]
```

2. After `load_and_process_tweets` in `tweet_preprocessor.py`
```python
processed_tweets = [
    "[Author: Trader_XO] @MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90",
    "[Author: Trader_XO] @TraderMagus Grifters are efficient that much I can tell you for free \n\nParticularly the ones who have found their balls again after a 15k move up off the lows"
]
```

3. In `load_documents` after combining tweets (`combined_text`)
```python
combined_text = """[Author: Trader_XO] @MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90
[Author: Trader_XO] @TraderMagus Grifters are efficient that much I can tell you for free \n\nParticularly the ones who have found their balls again after a 15k move up off the lows"""
```

4. After text splitting in `load_documents` (`doc_splits`)
```python
doc_splits = [
    "[Author: Trader_XO] @MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90",
    "[Author: Trader_XO] @TraderMagus Grifters are efficient that much I can tell you for free \n\nParticularly the ones who have found their balls again after a 15k move up off the lows"
]
```
Note: The actual splits might be different depending on the `chunk_size` and the length of the tweets.

5. In `create_vectorstore_and_retriever`, after converting to Document objects
```python
documents = [
    Document(page_content="[Author: Trader_XO] @MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90"),
    Document(page_content="[Author: Trader_XO] @TraderMagus Grifters are efficient that much I can tell you for free \n\nParticularly the ones who have found their balls again after a 15k move up off the lows")
]
```

6. After creating the vectorstore (not directly visible, but conceptually)
The vectorstore will contain vector representations of each document. For example:
```python
vector_representations = [
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.9],  # Vector for first document
    [0.2, 0.4, 0.1, ..., 0.7]   # Vector for second document
]
```

7. Final retriever object
The retriever is a function that, when given a query, will return the most relevant documents. For example:
```python
query = "What happened with the $5 trade?"
relevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
# Might return:
# [Document(page_content="[Author: Trader_XO] @MaxController Got cut at $5 \n\nBought back in at $1 and sold again at 1.90")]
```
