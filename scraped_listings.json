Built in 2016, Rowan is known for its exoskeleton, allowing the units to be largely column-free, creating clear sight lines and walls of floor-to-ceiling windows. This design is exemplified in the open concept kitchen, dining, and living areas that flow towards a wall of glass that opens to the Juliette balcony overlooking the city skyline. The bedroom takes advantage of these city views, while being a private retreat that leads to the updated, spa-like bathroom. The den offers much flexibility with its sliding barn door and is ideal for working from home or as a guest bedroom. Completing this home are in-unit washer and dryer, a Nest thermostat for controlling heat and A/C, and a large storage unit. The building features an expansive rooftop deck, zen garden, bike storage, attended front lobby, and support for fiber internet.
